class="title">Pipeline-Authoring SIG Update</h5></div><p class="teaser">What is the Pipeline-Authoring Special Interest Group

This special interest group aims to improve and curate the experience of authoring Jenkins Pipelines. This includes the
syntax of `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries, code sharing and reuse, testing of Pipelines and shared libraries, IDE
integration and other development tools, documentation, best practices, and examples.

What Are The Focus Areas of the Pipeline-Authoring Special Interest Group

Syntax - How `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries are written.

Code sharing and reuse - Shared libraries and future improvements.

Testing - Unit and functional testing of `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries.

IDE integration, editors, and other development tools - IDE plugins, visual editors, etc.

Documentation - Reference documentation, tutorials, and more.

Best practices - Defining, maintaining, and evangelizing best practices in Jenkins Pipeline.

Examples - Real-world `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries demonstrating how to utilize various features of Pipeline,
as well as basic or starter `Jenkinsfile`s for common patterns that can be used as jumping-off points by new users.

What Have We Been Up To

With the start of a new year, members got together to discuss the roadmap for 2020. During the initial discussions we
determined that it would be good to examine the goals of previous meetings and determine the best path forward.

A mutual decision was made that to better create a roadmap; we needed to understand better who we were aiming to help.
We decided that creating personas was very beneficial. Personas are fictional characters, which we are creating based
upon our research to represent the different user types that might use Jenkins pipelines.
Creating personas can help us step out of ourselves. It can help us to recognize that different people have different
needs and expectations, and it can also help us to identify with the user we are building the roadmap for. Personas make
the task at hand less complicated, they guide our ideation processes, and they can help us to achieve the goal of
creating a good user experience for our target user group.
A lot of that work can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdyzJwt50Wk3uUNsLMl2d4w2MGYss-phqet0s-KjbEs/edit
The idea is to map the personas to a maturity model and then map the maturity model to the actual documentation. That
maturity model can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ByzWlPU0j1qM_gqspJppkNKkR5ZVLWlB/view

How Can I Get Involved

We have been meeting regularly to define personas to help us better create the SIG roadmap. We meet twice a week,
once on Thursday for the EMEA timezone and once on Friday for the US timezone. Meeting notes can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EhWoBplGl4M8bHz0uuP-iOynPGuONjcz4enQm8sDyUE/edit# and the calendar, if you would
like to attend, is here: https://jenkins.io/event-calendar/. The previous recording of the meetings are
located here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz_kPpb9C1w&amp;list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOKKLBXek6iG8wTS24Ac7Y3

Next Steps

We have a lot of work to do and could use your help. If you would love to join us, check out the meeting link. If you
would like to check out the personas and give feedback, also check out the link.
Once we have wrapped up the personas work, we will start to identify the available documentation and ensure we have
adequate documentation with the help of the Doc SIG.
We will finally then start working to build out tools to help the community with pipelines in Jenkins better.

Problem Statement: Convert the existing schema validation workflow from the current scripting language in the Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin to a Java based rewrite thereby enhancing its readablity and testability supported by a testing framework for the same. Enhance developer experience by developing a VSCode Plugin to facilitate autocompletion and validation which would help the developer write correct yaml files before application to a Jenkins Instance.

The Configuration as Code plugin has been designed as an opinionated way to configure Jenkins based on human-readable declarative configuration files. Writing such a file should be feasible without being a Jenkins expert, just translating into code a configuration process one is used to executing in the web UI. The plugin uses a schema to verify the files being applied to the Jenkins instance.

With the new JSON Schema being enabled developers can now test their yaml file against it. The schema checks the descriptors i.e. configuration that can be applied to a plugin or Jenkins core, the correct type is used and help text is provided in some cases. VSCode allows us to test out the schema right out of the box with some modifications. This project was built as part of the Community Bridge initiative which is a platform created by the Linux Foundation to empower developers — and the individuals and companies who support them — to advance sustainability, security, and diversity in open source technology. You can take a look at the Jenkins Community Bridge Project Page

Steps to Enable the Schema Validation

a) The first step includes installing the JCasC Plugin for Visual Studio Code and opening up the extension via the extension list. Shortcut for opening the extension list in VSCode editor using Ctrl + Shift + X.

b) In order to enable validation we need to include it in the workspace settings.
Navigate to File and then Preference and then Settings. Inside settings search for json and inside settings.json include the following configuration.

{
&quot;yaml.schemas&quot;: {
        &quot;schema.json&quot;: &quot;y[a]?ml&quot;
    }
}

You can specify a glob pattern as the value for schema.json which is the file name for the schema. This would apply the schema to all yaml files. eg:.[y[a]?ml]

c) The following tasks can be done using VSCode:

a) Auto completion (Ctrl + Space):
  Auto completes on all commands.

b) Document Outlining (Ctrl + Shift + O):
Provides the document outlining of all completed nodes in the file.

d) Create a new file under the work directory called jenkins.yml. For example consider the following contents for the file:

jenkins:
  systemMessage: “Hello World”
  numExecutors: 2

The above yaml file is valid according to the schema and vscode should provide you with validation and autocompletion for the same.

Screenshots

We are holding an online meetup on the 26th February regarding this plugin and how you could use it to validate your YAML configuration files.
For any suggestions or dicussions regarding the schema feel free to join our gitter channel.

2019 for presenting the work I did during Google Summer of Code 2019.
What follows is a day-by-day summary of an amazing trip to the
conference.

Day 0: December 1, 2019

I am an undergraduate student from New Delhi, India and had traveled to
Lisbon to attend the conference. I had an early morning flight to Lisbon
from Delhi via Istanbul. At the Airport, I met Parichay who had been
waiting there from his connecting flight. After flying 8000 km, we
reached Lisbon. We took a taxi to the hotel and were greeted there by
one of my Google Summer of Code mentors, Oleg. After four months of
working with him on my GSoC project, meeting him was an amazing
experience. Later that day, after stretching our legs in the hotel, we
met Long for an early dinner, who came to the hotel after exploring much
of Lisbon.

Day 1: Hackfest, December 2

Next morning, we all met for breakfast where we all got to taste some
Pastel de Nata. We then took a cab to the Congress Centre for attending
the Jenkins and Jenkins X hackfest. At the Hackfest, I met Mark, Joseph,
Kasper, Andrey and other Jenkins contributors. I also met Oleg, this
time together with his son and his wife. After our introductions, and a
short presentation by Oleg, I started hacking on the Folder Auth plugin
and made it possible to delete user sids from roles. The best part of
hacking there was to get instant feedback on what I was working on. More
and more people kept coming throughout the day. It was great to see so
many people working hard to improve Jenkins. At the end, everyone
presented what they had achieved that day. Having skipped lunch for some
snacks, Oleg and others tried hard to get some pizza delivered without
much success. After the Hackfest, everyone was hungry and most attendees
including me went looking for nearby restaurants. Since it was early and
most restaurants were not open yet, we all decided to have burgers. It
was a great learning experience listening to and talking about Jenkins,
Elasticsearch, Jira, GitHub and a lot of other things. After that, we
took a taxi back to the hotel and I went to bed.

Day 2: Contributor Summit, December 3

We had the Jenkins and Jenkins X contributor summit the next day. Me and
Parichay took the bus to the Congress Centre in the morning. After
registration, I got my ‘Speaker’ badge and the conference T-shirt. The
contributor summit took place in the same hall as the Hackfest, but the
seating arrangement was completely different and there were a lot more
people. The summit started with everyone introducing themselves. It
turned out that there were a lot of people from Munich. There were
presentations and talks about all things Jenkins, Jenkins X and the
Continuous Delivery Foundation by Kohsuke, Oleg, Joseph, Liam, Olivier,
Wadek and others. I had no experience with Jenkins X which made the
summit very interesting. After lunch, the talks were over, and everyone
was free to join any session discussing various things about Jenkins. I
attended the Cloud Native Jenkins and the Configuration-as-Code
sessions.

While some of the conference attendees were in the Contributor summit,
the others were going through certifications and trainings. At around 5
o’clock in the evening, the summit and the trainings all got over and
the expo hall was thrown open. On the entrance, there was a large stack
of big DWJW bags. I did not realize why those bags were kept there.
Since everyone was taking one, I took one as well. As soon as I went
into the hall, I realized that those bags were for collecting swag. I
had never seen anything like this where sponsors were just giving away
T-shirts, stickers and other stuff. There were snacks and Kohsuke was
cutting the extremely tasty 15 years of Jenkins cake. After having the
cake, I went on a swag-collecting spree going from one sponsor booth to
the other. This was an amazing experience, not only was I able to get
cool stuff, I was also able to learn a lot about the software these
companies made and how it fits into the DevOps pipeline.

After the conference got over, me, Long and Parichay went to the Lisbon
Mariott Hotel for the Eurodog party. After collecting another T-shirt, I
went to the nearest restaurant (McDonald’s) with Andrey who I had
earlier met at the Hackfest.

Day 3: December 4

This was the first official day of the conference and it began with the
keynote. There were over 900 people in the keynote hall. It was amazing
to see so many people attending the conference. After the keynote got
over, I went to several sessions throughout the day learning about how
companies are using Jenkins and implementing DevOps tools.

In the evening, we had the Sonatype Superparty which was a lot of fun.
There were neon lights, arcade machines, VR experiences, superheroes and
more swag. There was a lot of good food including pizzas and burgers and
hot dogs. Superhero inspired desserts were very interesting. I was able
to talk to Oleg and Wadek about the security challenges in Jenkins.
During the party, I also got a chance to meet the CEO of CloudBees,
Sacha Labourey.

Day 4, December 5

This was the last day of the conference and it began with another
keynote. After the keynote, I attended a very interesting talk on how
the European Observatory built software for large telescopes using
Jenkins. After that, I prepared for my talk on the work I did during
Google Summer of Code 2019. I had my presentation in the community booth
during the lunch time. Presenting in front of real people was an amazing
experience and very different from the ones we had on Zoom chats for our
GSoC evaluations. In the evening, I got another chance to present my
project at the Jenkins Community Lightning Talks.

After that, the conference came to an end and I went back to the hotel.
After relaxing for some time, me, Parichay and Long were invited by Oleg
to a dinner at Corinthia Hotel with Kohsuke, Mark and his wife, Tracy,
Alyssa, and Liam. Unfortunately, Long couldn’t attend the dinner because
he had the flight back earlier that evening. After the amazing dinner, I
thanked everyone for such an amazing trip and said goodbye.

DWJW was the best experience I’ve ever had. I was able to learn about a
lot of new things and talk to some amazing people. In the end, I would
like to especially thank Oleg for helping me throughout and making it
possible for me to attend such a wonderful conference. I would like to
thank my other mentors Runze Xia and Supun for their support in my
Google Summer of Code project. I would like to thank Google for

Now, after the DevOps World | Jenkins World conference in Lisbon and final retrospective meetings, we can say that GSoC 2019 is officially over.
We would like to start by thanking all participants: students, mentors, subject matter experts and all other contributors who proposed project ideas, participated in student selection, in community bonding and in further discussions and reviews.
Google Summer of Code is a major effort which would not be possible without the active participation of the Jenkins community.

In this blogpost we would like to share the results and our experience from the previous year.

Results

Five GSoC projects were successfully completed this year:
Role Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements,
Plugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library,
Working Hours Plugin - UI Improvements,
Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features,
Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM.
We will talk about the projects a little later in the document.

Project details

We held the final presentations as Jenkins Online Meetups in late August and Google published the results on Sept 3rd.
The final presentations can be found here:
Part 1,
Part 2,
Part 3.
We also presented the
2019 Jenkins GSoC report
at the DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco
and at the
DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Lisbon conferences.

In the following sections, we present a brief summary of each project, links to the coding phase 3 presentations, and to the final products.

Role Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements

Role Strategy Plugin is one of the most widely used authorization plugins for Jenkins,
but it has never been famous for performance due to architecture issues and regular expression checks for project roles.
Abhyudaya Sharma was working on this project together with hist mentors:
Oleg Nenashev, Runze Xia and Supun Wanniarachchi.
He started the project from creating a new Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins based on JMH,
created benchmarks and achieved a 3501% improvement on some real-world scenarios.
Then he went further and created a new Folder-based Authorization Strategy Plugin which offers even better performance for Jenkins instances where permissions are scoped to folders.
During his project Abhyudaya also fixed the Jenkins Configuration-as-Code support in Role Strategy and contributed several improvements and fixes to the JCasC Plugin itself.

Plugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library

Natasha Stopa was working on a new CLI tool for plugin management,
which should unify features available in other tools like install-plugins.sh in Docker images.
It also introduced many new features like YAML configuration format support, listing of available updates and security fixes.
The newly created tool should eventually replace the previous ones.
Natasha’s mentors: Kristin Whetstone, Jon Brohauge and Arnab Banerjee.
Also, many contributors from Platform SIG and JCasC plugin team joined the project as a key stakeholders and subject-matter experts.

Working Hours Plugin - UI Improvements

Jenkins UI and frontend framework are a common topic in the Jenkins project,
especially in recent months after the new UX SIG was established.
Jack Shen was working on exploring new ways to build Jenkins Web UI together with his mentor Jeff Pearce.
Jack updated the Working Hours Plugin to use UI controls provided by standard React libraries.
Then he documented his experienced and created template for plugins with React-based UI.

Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features

Long Le Vu Nguyen was working on extended Kubernetes support in the Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin.
His mentors were Andrey Falco and Pham vu Tuan who was our GSoC 2018 student and the plugin creator.
During this project Long has added a new agent launcher which provisions Jenkins agents in Kubernetes and connects them to the controller.
He also created a Cloud API implementation for it and a new Helm chart which can provision Jenkins as entire system in Kubernetes,
with Apache Kafka enabled by default.
All these features were released in Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0.

Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM

Parichay Barpanda was working on the new GitLab Branch Source Plugin with Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs and Folder Organisation support.
His mentors were
Marky Jackson-Taulia,
Justin Harringa,
Zhao Xiaojie and
Joseph Petersen.
The plugin scans the projects, importing the pipeline jobs it identifies based on the criteria provided.
After a project is imported, Jenkins immediately runs the jobs based on the Jenkinsfile pipeline script and notifies the status to GitLab Pipeline Status.
This plugin also provides GitLab server configuration which can be configured in Configure System or via Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC).
read more about this project in the GitLab Branch Source 1.0 announcement.

Projects which were not completed

Not all projects have been completed this year.
We were also working on Artifact Promotion plugin for Jenkins Pipeline
and on Cloud Features for External Workspace Manager Plugin,
but unfortunately both projects were stopped after coding phase 1.
Anyway, we got a lot of experience and takeaways in these areas (see linked Jira tickets!.
We hope that these stories will be implemented by Jenkins contributors at some point.
Google Summer of Code 2020 maybe?

Running the GSoC program at our organization level

Here are some of the things our organization did before and during GSoC behind the scenes.
To prepare for the influx of students, we updated all our GSoC pages and wrote down all the knowledge we accumulated over the years of running the program.
We started preparing in October 2018, long before the official start of the program.
The main objective was to address the feedback we got during GSoC 2018 retrospectives.

Project ideas.
We started gathering project ideas in the last months of 2018.
We prepared a list of project ideas in a Google doc, and we tracked ownership of each project in a table of that document.
Each project idea was further elaborated in its own Google doc.
We find that when projects get complicated during the definition phase, perhaps they are really too complicated and should not be done.

Since we wanted all the project ideas to be documented the same way, we created a template to guide the contributors.
Most of the project idea documents were written by org admins or mentors, but occasionally a student proposed a genuine idea.
We also captured contact information in that document such as GitHub and Gitter handles, and a preliminary list of potential mentors for the project.
We embedded all the project documents on our website.

Mentor and student guidelines.
We updated the mentor information page with details on what we expect mentors to do during the program,
including the number of hours that are expected from mentors,
and we even have a section on preventing conflict of interest.
When we recruit mentors, we point them to the mentor information page.

We also updated the student information page.
We find this is a huge time saver as every student contacting us has the same questions about joining and participating in the program.
Instead of re-explaining the program each time, we send them a link to those pages.

Application phase.
Students started to reach out very early on as well, many weeks before GSoC officially started.
This was very motivating.
Some students even started to work on project ideas before the official start of the program.

Project selection. This year the org admin team had some very difficult decisions to make.
With lots of students, lots of projects and lots of mentors, we had to request the right number of slots and try to match the projects with the most chances of success.
We were trying to form mentor teams at the same time as we were requesting the number of slots, and it was hard to get responses from all mentors in time for the deadline.
Finally we requested fewer slots than we could have filled.
When we request slots, we submit two numbers: a minimum and a maximum. The GSoC guide states that:

The minimum is based on the projects that are so amazing they really want to see these projects occur over the summer,

and the maximum number should be the number of solid and amazing projects they wish to mentor over the summer.

We were awarded minimum. So we had to make very hard decisions: we had to decide between &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;solid&quot; proposals.
For some proposals, the very outstanding ones, it’s easy.
But for the others, it’s hard.
We know we cannot make the perfect decision, and by experience, we know that some students or some mentors will not be able to complete the program due to uncontrollable life events, even for the outstanding proposals.
So we have to make the best decision knowing that some of our choices won’t complete the program.

Community Bonding.
We have found that the community bonding phase was crucial to the success of each project.
Usually projects that don’t do well during community bonding have difficulties later on.
In order to get students involved in the community better, almost all projects were handled under the umbrella of Special Interest Groups so that there were more stakeholders and communications.

Communications.
Every year we have students who contact mentors via personal messages.
Students, if you are reading this, please do NOT send us personal messages about the projects, you will not receive any preferential treatment.
Obviously, in open source we want all discussions to be public, so students have to be reminded of that regularly.
In 2019 we are using Gitter chat for most communications, but from an admin point of view this is more fragmented than mailing lists.
It is also harder to search.
Chat rooms are very convenient because they are focused, but from an admin point of view, the lack of threads in Gitter makes it hard to get an overview.
Gitter threads were added recently (Nov 2019) but do not yet work well on Android and iOS.
We adopted Zoom Meetings towards the end of the program and we are finding it easier to work with than Google Hangouts.

Status tracking.
Another thing that was hard was to get an overview of how all the projects were doing once they were running.
We made extensive use of Google sheets to track lists of projects and participants during the program
to rank projects and to track statuses of project phases (community bonding, coding, etc.).
It is a challenge to keep these sheets up to date, as each project involves several people and several links.
We have found it time consuming and a bit hard to keep these sheets up to date, accurate and complete, especially up until the start of the coding phase.

Perhaps some kind of objective tracking tool would help.
We used Jenkins Jira for tracking projects, with each phase representing a separate sprint.
It helped a lot for successful projects.
In our organization, we try to get everyone to beat the deadlines by a couple of days, because we know that there might be events such as power outages,
bad weather (happens even in Seattle!), or other uncontrolled interruptions, that might interfere with submitting project data.
We also know that when deadlines coincide with weekends, there is a risk that people may forget.

Retrospective.
At the end of our project, we also held a retrospective and captured some ideas for the future.
You can find the notes here.
We already addressed the most important comments in our documentation and project ideas for the next year.

Recognition

Last year, we wanted to thank everyone who participated in the program by sending swag.
This year, we collected all the mailing addresses we could and sent to everyone we could the 15-year Jenkins special edition T-shirt, and some stickers.
This was a great feel good moment.
I want to personally thank Alyssa Tong her help on setting aside the t-shirt and stickers.

Mentor summit

Each year Google invites two or more mentors from each organization to the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit.
At this event, hundreds of open-source project maintainers and mentors meet together and have unconference sessions targeting GSoC, community management and various tools.
This year the summit was held in Munich,
and we sent Marky Jackson and Oleg Nenashev as representatives there.

Apart from discussing projects and sharing chocolate, we also presented Jenkins there, conducted a lightning talk and hosted the unconference session about automation bots for GitHub.
We did not make a team photo there, so try to find Oleg and Marky on this photo:

GSoC Team at DevOps World | Jenkins World

We traditionally use GSoC organization payments and travel grants to sponsor student trips to major Jenkins-related events.
This year four students traveled to the DevOps World | Jenkins World conferences in San-Francisco and Lisbon.
Students presented their projects at the community booth and at the contributor summits,
and their presentations got a lot of traction in the community!

Thanks a lot to Google and CloudBees who made these trips possible.
You can find a travel report from Natasha Stopa here,
more travel reports are coming soon.

Conclusion

This year, five projects were successfully completed.
We find this to be normal and in line with what we hear from other participating organizations.

Taking the time early to update our GSoC pages saved us a lot of time later because we did not have to repeat all the information every time someone contacted us.
We find that keeping track of all the mentors, the students, the projects, and the meta information is a necessary but time consuming task.
We wish we had a tool to help us do that.
Coordinating meetings and reminding participants of what needs to be accomplished for deadlines is part of the cheerleading aspect of GSoC, we need to keep doing this.

Lastly, I want to thank again all participants, we could not do this without you.
Each year we are impressed by the students who do great work and bring great contributions to the Jenkins community.

GSoC 2020?

Yes, there will be Google Summer of Code 2020!
We plan to participate, and we are looking for project ideas, mentors and students.
Jenkins GSoC pages have been already updated towards the next year, and we invite everybody interested to join us next year!

By the end of January, I’ll be officially stepping back from Jenkins,
switching my role at CloudBees to an advisor,
and turning attention to my new startup.
The rest of this post is to contextualize this transition, because if you haven’t been working closely with me, this might come across as a surprise.

Jenkins has been an amazing journey that never stopped giving.
I have loved it all - especially meeting the users around the world who made Jenkins what it is today.
As the creator of the project, at some point I started wondering how to pass the torch to the next leaders, how to get people to step up and drive it forward.
Today, thanks to CloudBees and the community, there is a new generation of talented and capable leaders who are passionately driving things forward - and it’s been great to see.
Newly elected board members, Jenkins X folks, just to name a few.
These new people bring new culture and new code, and altogether it has created a positive jolt that pushed Jenkins out of a local optimum I talked about.
They have all my support and respect.
In reality, my involvement with Jenkins lately has already been largely symbolic, a little bit like an emperor of Japan or a queen of the UK.
That’s why this announcement has little practical impact on the forward motion of Jenkins.

Several years ago, I used to feel like the sky would fall down if I stepped aside.
Somewhere in 2019, I suddenly noticed that I wasn’t feeling like that at all anymore.
The shift was gradual and steady, so I’m not sure exactly when I crossed the threshold, but in 2019 it was clear I was on the other side.
That’s how I knew I could finally end this chapter of my life.
15 years with Jenkins and 9 years with CloudBees.
That is a long time.

I hope you will be wondering what is my new chapter.
I’m launching a new startup, Launchable, with my old time buddy Harpreet Singh.
I have known him since my days at Sun Microsystems and JavaEE, and he was my partner in crime at CloudBees to build the Jenkins business from scratch.
He went to Atlassian running its BitBucket business for a while, but now he and I are back sitting side by side again.
A number of CloudBees people invested, including Sacha Labourey,
Bob Bickel,
and John Vrionis.

Through Jenkins and CloudBees, I was able to push the state of automation forward in software development.
Such automation is producing a lot of data, but we are not using that data to improve our lives.
It truly is a wasted gold mine.
Launchable is working on harnessing that information to improve developer productivity.
I wrote a separate blog post to discuss more about my thinking.

Lastly, even though I’m moving on from CloudBees as a full-time employee, I’m not completely going away.
I’ll be still in the CloudBees orbit, as an advisor.
I’m still very much invested both emotionally and financially in CloudBees.
I’m still a big fan, and I’ll continue to cheer for them, but from the sideline.
The same with Jenkins.
I’m still on the governance board, ensuring the continuity.
I’m also still on the Technical Oversight Committee of the Continuous Delivery Foundation,
though my chairperson term will expire in March.

I’m incredibly grateful for the undeserved opportunity and the privilege given to me during this chapter.
I was surrounded by wonderful, inspiring, and talented people, from whom I learned a lot.
I can only hope that I was able to make a positive impact, and give something back in return to them.
I won’t name names, but you know who you are, and we’ll stay in touch.

This year is going to be truly exciting for me. To infinity and beyond!!<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community">community</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/governance">governance</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/announcement">announcement</a></li></ul></div></li><li class="post"><a class="body" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/2020/01/10/fosdem-is-coming/"><div class="header"><div class="date"><div class="month">Jan</div><div class="day">10</div></div><h5 class="title">FOSDEM 2020 is coming</h5></div><p class="teaser">FOSDEM 2020 is coming and with it, a lot of great folks come in town.
It’s always a great moment to meet Jenkins community members, share stories and get inspired.
I hope that this year will be as great as it always been and for that, we organize a few things

Things we’ll do

During the whole event, we’ll be virtually on the Gitter

On the Thursday 30 of January, there will be two workshops one about Jenkins Pipelines lead by Mark Waite, and a second one about JenkinsX by Viktor Farcic.

On the Friday 31 of January, the Jenkins project will hold a Contributor Summit where we invite active contributors and those who are interested in working on foundation projects, e.g. key architecture changes and projects (UX, JCasC, Cloud native Jenkins, etc.), governance, infrastructure. There will be no user-focused topics (no presentations, no trainings, etc.) but we will focus on defining key priorities for the project, building a roadmap and resolving issues we have in the project at the moment.
We’ll end up the day with our now traditional Orval and flemish beef stew at Le Roy d’Espagne

Finally the FOSDEM, the 01 and 02 of February, we’ll all be at FOSDEM. So come and say &quot;hi&quot; at the Jenkins/JenkinsX stand, inside the CICD Devroom.

Or just come and share beers

Let’s take a look at some changes this year.

Highlights

We celebrated 15 years of Jenkins

We had first ever Governance Board and Officer elections

Jenkins project joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)

We released Java 11 support in Jenkins

Jenkins X has graduated as a Jenkins sub-project and became a new project under umbrella of CDF

In October 2019 we reached the record high number of contributions: 915 unique contributors, 124 of them were first-timers

We started new special interest groups for Documentation and User Experience.

A new position of the Documentation officer was introduced to highlight an important role of documentation in the project

We ran multiple mentorship programs with 12 mentees in total: Google Summer of Code, Hacktoberfest and Outreachy

If you are interested to know more about Jenkins features introduced in 2019,
stay tuned for a separate blog post about it (coming soon!).

Project updates

Highlights above do not cover all advancements we had in the project.
Below you can find slides from the Jenkins contributor summit in Lisbon.
There we had project updates by officers, SIG and sub-project leaders.
See the slide deck to know about: Jenkins Core, Pipeline, Configuration-as-Code, Security, UX Overhaul, Jenkins Infrastructure, platform support and documentation.

Some stats and numbers

If this section seems to be too long for you, here is some infographic prepared by Tracy Miranda.
As you may see, Jenkins is pretty big :)

Community.
Over the past year we had 5433 contributors in GitHub repositories (committers, reviewers, issue submitters, etc.).
We had 1892 unique committers who created 7122 pull requests and 45484 commits, bots excluded.
Contributors represent 273 companies and 111 countries, 8% of contributors are recognized as independent.
The most active repositories were Jenkins Core and jenkins.io.
The most active month was October 2019 when we reached the record high number of contributions: 915 unique contributors, 124 of them were first-timers, thanks to Hacktoberfest!.

Jenkins core.
In 2019 Jenkins core had 54 weekly and 13 LTS releases with several hundreds of notable fixes/enhancements.
There was a login screen extensibility rework, many update manager and administrative monitors improvements.
We also introduced support for user timezones, not speaking of emojis support 🥳.
There was also a lot of housekeeping work: better APIs, codebase refresh, cleaning up static analysis warnings and removing deprecated features like Remoting CLI.
The core’s components also got major updates.
Only Jenkins Remoting got 11 releases with stability improvements and new features like support of inbound connections to headless Jenkins controllers.
There are also major incoming features like jep:222[WebSocket Services support], UI look&amp;feel updates, jira:JENKINS-12548[Readonly system configuration support], Docker images for new platforms like Arm.
To facilitate further changes we created a new Core pull request reviewers team and added 9 contributors there.

Plugins.
There were 2654 plugin releases, and 157 NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.
Jenkins ecosystem got a lot of new integrations with Development and DevOps tools.
Also, warm welcome back to the Scriptler Plugin which was depublished in 2017 due to security issues.
If you are afraid about such plugin numbers and dependency management, there is a new Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool which should help Jenkins users to manage plugins more efficiently.

Security.
It was a hot year for the Jenkins Security Team.
There were 5 security advisories for the core and 20 - for plugins.
In total we disclosed 288 vulnerabilities across the project, including some backlog cleaning for unmaintained plugins.
Script Security Plugin was the hottest plugin with 10 critical fixes addressing various sandbox bypass vulnerabilities.
Plain text storage and unprotected credentials were the most popular vulnerability type 120 disclosures in 2019.
It was made possible by hundreds of reports submitted by contributors after code surveys,
special thanks to Viktor Gazdag who reported the most of the issues and became the Jenkins 2019 Security MVP (check out his story here).

Infrastructure.
Got Jenkins? If so, you rely on Jenkins update centers, website and issue tracker.
All these and many other services are maintained by the Jenkins Infrastructure Team.
This year the team handled more than 400 requests in the bugtracker, and many other informal requests.
In total, more than 30 people contributed to Jenkins infrastructure this year (website content is excluded).
We also deployed 4 new services, migrated 7 services from Azure Container Service to Azure Kubernetes Service and updated many other services.
More changes will happen in the next months, and we are looking for new INFRA team members!

Documentation.
Only last quarter we had 178 contributors to Jenkins documentation. It includes jenkins.io and other documentation hosted on GitHub, Wiki is not included.
There is also ongoing migration plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub ( announcement).
Since the beginning of the project in Sep 2019, more than 150 plugin were migrated, and they got significant documentation revamp during the migration.
You can see the current status here.
We also work on introducing changelog automation in the project.
123 plugins have already adopted the new changelog tools, powered by Release Drafter.
Also, we had more than 60 technical blog posts published on jenkins.io.

Configuration as Code was one of the most popular areas this year.
Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin had more than 30 releases with new features and bug fixes.
More than 50 plugins have been also updated in order to offer better configuration-as-code support.
As a result, the JCasC Plugin got massive adoption this year (from 2000 to almost 8000 installations),
and now it becomes a de-facto standard for managing Jenkins as code.
This year we also ran our very first CommunityBridge project devoted to JCasC Schema validation and developer tools.

Events and outreach programs.
In 2019 we participated in multiple conferences, including FOSDEM, DevOps World | Jenkins World, SCALE.
More than 40 Jenkins Area Meetups were organized across the world, and there were many other meetups devoted to Jenkins.
We also kept expanding our outreach programs.
In total we had 12 students who participated in Google Summer of Code, Outreachy and newly introduced Community Bridge.
We also had the biggest ever Hacktoberfest with 664 pull requests and 102 participants.
These outreach programs help us to deliver new features in Jenkins.
For example, this year we added Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab and a new Plugin Installation Manager Tool during GSoC,
and Outreachy resulted in a new Audit Log Plugin.

Where did we get those stats?
GitHub stats came from the CDF DevStats service.
These stats include all repositories in the jenkinsci organization and most popular repositories in jenkins-infra, Jenkins X and other organizations/repositories within the project are not included.
Other stats came from project reports, component changelogs, Jenkins usage statistics service, plugin releases history.

What’s next?

Year 2020 will be pretty busy for the Jenkins project.
There are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want the project to succeed.
As it was written Board elections blogpost,
there are many areas to consider: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.
In the coming months there will be a lot of discussions in mailing lists and special interest groups,
and we invite all teams to work on their roadmaps and to communicate them in the community.

Next month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a Jenkins stand there.
On January 31st we will also host a traditional contributor summit in Brussels,
where we will talk about next steps for the project, in terms of technical roadmaps and the project governance.
If you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join us at the summit!
See this thread for more information.

We also plan to continue all outreach programs.
At the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement),
and we will be also interested to consider non-coding projects as a part of other programs like CommunityBridge.
We also work on improving contribution guidelines for newcomers and expert contributors.
If you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.

And even more

This blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project.
The Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.
Thanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day.
We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size.
Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc.
THANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!

So, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.
And stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community">community</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/new-year-blogpost">new-year-blogpost</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/governance">governance</a></li></ul></div></li><li class="post"><a class="body" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/2019/12/20/call-for-mentors/"><div class="header"><div class="date"><div class="month">Dec</div><div class="day">20</div></div><h5 class="title">Google Summer of Code 2020 call for Project ideas and Mentors</h5></div><p class="teaser">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

Mentors are actively involved with students starting at the end of February when students start to work on and submit their applications.
(see the timeline)

We are looking for project ideas and mentors to participate in GSoC 2020.
GSoC project ideas are coding projects that university or college students can accomplish in about four months.
The coding projects can be new features, plugins, test frameworks, infrastructure, etc.
Anyone can submit a project idea, but of course we like it even better if you offer to mentor your project idea.

We accept new project ideas at any time,
BUT we need a series of ideas READY before February 5th, 2020 at 7pm UTC,
which is the deadline for the Jenkins organization to apply to the GSoC program.
So send us your project ideas before the beginning of February so they can get a proper review by the GSoC committee and by the community.

How to submit a project idea

For 2020, we have simplified the process.
Simply create a pull-request with your idea in a.adoc file
in the idea folder.
It is no longer necessary to submit a Google Doc, but it will still work if you want to do that.
See the instructions on submitting ideas which include an.adoc template and some examples.

Current list of ideas

We currently have a list of project ideas for students to browse,
copied from last year. Note that this list is subject to change.

What does mentoring involve?

Potential mentors are invited to read the information for mentors.
Note that being a GSoC mentor does not require expert knowledge of Jenkins.
Mentors do not work alone. We make sure that every project has at least two mentors.
GSoC org admins will help to find technical advisers, so you can study together with your students.

Mentoring takes about 5 to 8 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).
Mentors provide guidance, coaching, and sometimes a bit of cheerleading.
They review student proposals, pull-requests and the students presentations
at the evaluation phase.
They fill in the Google provided evaluation report form at the end of coding periods.

What do you get in exchange?

In return of mentoring, a student works on your project full time for four months.
Think about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but never had the time…​

Having a mentoring opportunity also means that you get to improve your management and people skills.

As well, up to two mentors per organization are eligible to participate in the Google Mentor Summit taking place each year.
The Jenkins Org Admins try to send different mentors each year.
It is also possible to win an additional seat at the summit in the &quot;last minute draw&quot;
(Google draws mentors at random to fill the cancellations and empty seats).

See this post from one of the 2019 mentors
on the kind of experience this was.

GSoC is a pretty good return on the investment!

For any question, you can find the GSoC Org Admins,
mentors and participants on the GSoC SIG Gitter chat.<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/gsoc">gsoc</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/gsoc2020">gsoc2020</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community">community</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/events">events</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/developer">developer</a></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></div><div><nav><ul class="pagination"><li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community/page/3">«</a></li><li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community">1</a></li><li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community/page/2">2</a></li><li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community/page/3">3</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current="page" class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community/page/4">4</a></li><li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community/page/5">5</a></li><li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community/page/6">6</a></li><li class="page item disabled"><div class="page-link">...</div></li><li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community/page/8">8</a></li><li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community/page/9">9</a></li><li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community/page/10">10</a></li><li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/community/page/5">»</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><script src="https://www.jenkins.io/assets/bower/anchor-js/anchor.min.js"></script><script src="https://www.jenkins.io/assets/bower/tether/js/tether.min.js"></script><script src="https://www.jenkins.io/assets/bower/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><footer id="footer"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-4"><div class="license-box"><div id="creativecommons"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"><p><img alt="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license" src="https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png"/></p></a><p>The content driving this site is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license.</p></div></div></div><div class="links col-md-8"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="area col-md-3"><div class="div-mar"><h5>Resources</h5><ul class="resources"><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/download/">Downloads</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/node/">Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/">Documentation</a></li><li><a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/">Plugins</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/security/">Security</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/participate/">Contributing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="area col-md-3"><div class="div-mar"><h5>Project</h5><ul class="project"><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/project/">Structure and governance</a></li><li><a href="https://issues.jenkins.io">Issue tracker</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/project/roadmap/">Roadmap</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://ci.jenkins.io">Jenkins on Jenkins</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="area col-md-3"><div class="div-mar"><h5>Community</h5><ul class="community"><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/events/">Events</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/mailing-lists/">Mailing lists</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/chat/">Chats</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/">Special Interest Groups</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/jenkinsci">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://reddit.com/r/jenkinsci">Reddit</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="area col-md-3"><div class="div-mar"><h5>Other</h5><ul class="other"><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/press/">Press information</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/merchandise/">Merchandise</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/artwork/">Artwork</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/awards/">Awards</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></footer><script>
