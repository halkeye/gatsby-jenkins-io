the Jenkins community has moved all its official IRC channels to Libera chat.
We have started our migration on May 26 as a response to the
hostile takeover
of hundreds of open source community channel by the new Freenode management.
As decided  by the Jenkins governance meeting on June 16th,
Libera Chat IRC channels are the only official channels going forward.

A more detailed history of the transition is available on the Jenkins developers mailing list.

What did we move?

We have created the following IRC chats:

that currently live on freenode to libera.chat:

#jenkins - general discussion channel for Jenkins users and developers.
We no longer consider it a central chat for all things Jenkins, but we intend to keep it available to users
who want to keep using IRC.

#jenkins-hosting - Chat used by the Hosting Team to manage hosting automation

#jenkins-infra - Chat used by the Infrastructure Team to coordinate efforts related to Jenkins project infrastructure and the incident response

#jenkins-release - Chat used for Jenkins core release coordination by the Release Team

All other channels have NOT been moved to Libera Chat IRC and were replaced by other channels.
Most notable channels:

#jenkins-meeting - the Jenkins Governance Meeting uses combination of Zoom and Google Docs at the moment. We do not longer use the IRC chat for that purpose.

#jenkins-cert - no private chat going forward. The Security Team will use mailing lists only going forward

#jenkins-community - Replaced by the Advocacy&amp;Outreach Gitter channel.

Freenode concerns and disclaimers

Going forward, the Jenkins community does not have ANY official channels on Freenode.
All channels are either removed or left abandoned.
We no longer manage or control our channels.
Most of the Jenkins IRC channel operators use IRCCloud,
and hence they were banned by the Freenode team on June 11th.
Only a few operators have reconnected since this event.

Taking the takeover of Freenode and hostile actions taken by the new management,
we can no longer guarantee any of the following:

Authenticity of registered users on Freenode.
All IRC accounts, cloaked or not, might have been taken over by the new Freenode management.
 Do not trust messages from the Jenkins contributor account IDs there.

Confidentiality of private channels like #jenkins-cert.
We performed audit of the conversations there, and we believe there are no undisclosed security vulnerabilities referenced in the channel.
 After all, this IRC has been rather dormant for the last 18 months.

IRC User Passwords.
All passwords on Freenode IRC may be compromised in the future.
We strongly advise all users to rotate their passwords if they were used on Freenode IRC.

We have made backups of IRC channel conversations in the abandoned channels.
If you need to access the conversation history, please reach out to the Jenkins Infrastructure team.

Acknowledgements

We thank the entire Libera Chat team and all contributors who have worked on creating
a Freenode replacement for hundreds of open source communities using IRC.
Within just a month, a new platform has been created and adopted by almost all active projects.
We remember the Hudson to Jenkins renaming days when a similar mobilization happened in the Jenkins community,
and we appreciate all the effort put by contributors.

Special thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels
and our automation like the IRC Bot used by the Jenkins hosting team.

What’s next?

In the Jenkins community we will keep using Libera Chat IRC and maintaining user and contributor channels there.
Other Jenkins chat channels like Gitter and Slack are unchanged.
We intend to gradually replace many of those channels with community.jenkins.io.
This is a new portal powered by Discourse.
The service is sponsored by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc..
It is currently in preview, stay tuned for announcements.
As always, we will appreciate any suggestions and [feedback]( https://community.jenkins.io/c/site-feedback/2)!<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><a href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/markewaite/">Mark Waite</a>, <a aria-current="page" class="" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev/">Oleg Nenashev</a><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/community">community</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/announcement">announcement</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/chat">chat</a></li></ul></div></li><li class="post"><a class="body" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/2021/03/22/governance-updates/"><div class="header"><div class="date"><div class="month">March</div><div class="day">22</div></div><h5 class="title">Welcome Ewelina Wilkosz - new Jenkins Governance Board member</h5></div><p class="teaser">We would like to announce changes in the Jenkins Governance Board.
As it was announced earlier this month, Marky Jackson has decided to step down from his elected roles.
On behalf of the Jenkins community, we would like to thank Marky for all contributions and for the continued participation in the Jenkins community.
As an active Jenkins contributor and community leader, Marky helped a lot of initiatives to happen:
 Jenkins and Kubernetes ecosystem, terminology changes, GSoC and GSoD, pipeline authoring SIG and many more activities.
Thank you Marky!

The governance board has followed the interim procedure
to nominate the new governance board member until the end of the term.
The board decided to respect the results of the 2020 elections and
to nominate Ewelina Wilkosz who received the most of the votes after the elected candidates.
She has accepted the nomination, and on March 10th the Governance Meeting has confirmed it.
We are happy to welcome Ewelina Wilkosz as a new Governance Board Member!

Ewelina will join other governance Board Members:
Kohsuke Kawaguchi,
Ullrich Hafner,
Oleg Nenashev, and
Gavin Mogan.
The term will last until December 2022.

About Ewelina Wilkosz

Ewelina has been a Jenkins Contributor since 2017, when she got involved in Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin development.
Voted Most Valuable Jenkins Contributor in 2018.
She has 14 years of experience in IT, working as a CI/CD consultant since the beginning of 2017.
In that role she’s trying to solve numerous issues Jenkins users are facing daily - as developers, administrators, maintainers.

Here is Ewelina’s statement from the elections:

As a consultant I support my customers with their Jenkins issues since the beginning of 2017.
And almost from the start it was some kind of &quot;as code&quot; approach.
The experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.
I consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.
I appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is.

I am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience
with Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.
Every day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.
As a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.

Thanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development
I had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations
where I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.
Here are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:
blogpost,
cdCON presentation,
podcast recording.
So my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,
so I actually know what they need and why.

What’s next for the Jenkins Governance Board?

In February we had the Jenkins Contributor Summit.
There we discussed many topics related to the Jenkins evolution and its roadmap.
We identified several initiatives we would like to focus on,
including but not limited to improving user experience, contributor onboarding, and securing Jenkins delivery pipelines.
These initiatives will be a key focus until the next contributor summit we plan to organize in June.
The board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes
(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and facilitating contributions to the project.

Participating in Jenkins Governance

Jenkins Governance Board has just a representative function in the community.
The project and the community have a long history of open and inclusive governance driven by many contributors.
We invite all community members to participate in the project by joining the
governance meeting,
participating in the mailing list conversations,
and joining special interest groups driving particular topics.

In 2020 the Jenkins security team has released 19 advisories for the Jenkins core, plugins and other components.
In total 198 vulnerabilities were fixed, and 72 plugin vulnerabilities were announced without a fix at the time of advisory publishing.
As a project, we are receiving a continuous flow of new reports and continue to provide corrections.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were the most popular type this year, followed by unprotected credentials.

There have also been developer tooling improvements,
including GitHub CodeQL evaluation for targeted security issues search
and Find-Sec-Bugs adoption for static analysis of the plugin and Jenkins core code.
Along with wider adoption of Dependabot and automated dependency scanning on GitHub.

Documentation

Jenkins Documentation SIG is working on creating more documentation for Jenkins on different platforms,
including cloud platforms.
Jenkins on Kubernetes was one of the key stories this year for the SIG,
along with documentation migration to jenkins.io and wider adoption of Documentation-as-code in plugins.
95% of the 200 most installed Jenkins plugins have moved to &quot;documentation as code&quot; or have a pending pull request with updates.
In total, almost 600 plugins have already been migrated.
There were major updates in Jenkins documentation on jenkins.io, with a lot of content being moved from the old Jenkins Wiki.

2020 was the first year when Jenkins participated in Google Season of Docs (GSoD).
This program brings together open-source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.
This year’s student, Zainab Abubakar,
did an amazing job documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes.
Now Jenkins users can find official documentation about deploying and scaling Jenkins in Kubernetes.
See the project report by Zainab here.

Jenkins Release Automation

The Jenkins project has delivered weekly and long term support releases since it was formed in 2011.
Those releases were delivered by Kohsuke Kawaguchi from his release infrastructure.

Beginning in April 2020, those releases are delivered by the new release automation setup.
It is hosted within the Jenkins’ Kubernetes cluster, with fully automated management and continuous delivery of services within the setup.
We transitioned to new build processes, new code signing certificates, and new release automation jobs.
Thanks to Olivier Vernin and all Infrastructure sub-project contributors for the successful completion of the release automation project!

Moreover, there is ongoing work on continuous delivery of Jenkins plugins ( JEP-229) and on re-designing other Jenkins instances within the project (infra-ci, trusted-ci, and ci.jenkins.io for plugins).
In the next few months these stories should provide Jenkins contributors with a modern environment for CI and CD of all Jenkins components.

Terminology updates

Since July, we have officially replaced the old &quot;master&quot; terminology with the &quot;controller&quot; term.
It is a follow-up to the &quot;agent&quot; terminology introduced in 2016.
We have also deprecated usages of the “blacklist/whitelist” terminology in all components.
Currently the community is working on the cleanup of the remaining occurrences in the codebase and documentation, and we invite everyone to contribute.

As a part of the terminology cleanup, last spring we announced the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.
As a reminder, it does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.

See more information about terminology updates here and here.

“Jenkins is the Way” program

This year the Advocacy and Outreach SIG started the “Jenkins is the Way” initiative which focuses on promoting user success stories.
Over the year, the team published 54 user stories and six case studies on https://jenkinsistheway.io/ as well as a significant amount of community marketing.
We also published a number of testimonial videos advertising user stories,
including this Introduction to &quot;Jenkins is the Way&quot; video.

See all the stories HERE

Events

Google Summer of Code

In 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.
We had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.
As usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.
The projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes needed for the long-term evolution of Jenkins.

This is the first-ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.
It was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!

Jenkins in Hacktoberfest 2020

In October we participated in Hacktoberfest.
Our featured projects included the Jenkins core, jenkins.io website and plugins.jenkins.io, Helm charts, and multiple plugins.
We also encouraged contributors to participate in the Documentation as Code and terminology cleanup across the entire Jenkins ecosystem.

See the details in the Hacktoberfest page.

In total we received 226 pull requests from Hacktoberfest participants.
Some stats per Jenkins GitHub organization:

&#x27;jenkinsci&#x27;, PRs: 189, Hacktoberfest contributors: 61

&#x27;jenkins-infra&#x27;, PRs: 100, Hacktoberfest contributors: 40

&#x27;jenkins-zh&#x27;, PRs: 37, Hacktoberfest contributors: 2

Jenkins at DevOps World

The annual DevOps World,
formerly known as DevOps World | Jenkins World held on Sept 22-24, with workshops on Sept 25.
Just like other events in 2020, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that didn’t mean there was a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There were over 50 Jenkins/open-source.
And a special congratulations is in order to this year’s Jenkins Contributor Award winners:

James Holderness - Jenkins security MVP

Marky Jackson - Most valuable Jenkins advocate

Tim Jacomb - Most valuable Jenkins contributor

Below are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :

Jenkins Where It Is and Where It Is Going

One Jenkins to Rule them All

Jenkins UI Gets a Makeover

Jenkins Pipeline and DevSecOps for API Security

Graduation at Continuous Delivery Foundation

Jenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.
In August the project announced that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).
Thanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!
Below you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:

We introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.
This roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.
It makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters, and at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.
The roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in JEP-14.

A new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.
This list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,
including ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.
Please do not hesitate to add your company there!

We passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.
This certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices and to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).
It also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.
Details are on the Jenkins core page.

Jenkins Code of Conduct was updated to the new version of Contributor Covenant.
In particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.

More information can be found HERE, and HERE.

Public Roadmap

The Jenkins project now has a public, community-driven project roadmap.  Roadmap items are major initiatives and are considered as official plans.
The roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all areas of the project.

Many of the 2020 released roadmap items are mentioned elsewhere in this document, including release automation, Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification,
user interface improvements, read-only configuration pages,
and Google Summer of Code projects like the GitHub Checks API or External Fingerprint Storage.

Other roadmap items include mirror infrastructure improvements, a new Windows installer,
and preview releases of pluggable storage for external fingerprints, build logs, and unit test results.

Jenkins 2020 Elections

In October-December the Jenkins community held the regular elections.
This year we were  electing for 2 governance board members and for all five officer positions, namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation. These roles are an essential part of Jenkins&#x27; community governance and well-being. We thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.

Key results:

Gavin Mogan and Marky Jackson joined the Jenkins Governance Board

Tim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer

Marky Jackson became the new Events Officer

Olivier Vernin, Daniel Beck, and Mark Waite will continue as Infrastructure, Security and Documentation officers

Full election results: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/03/election-results/

And even more

This blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project,
it is just a slice of the key highlights mentioned by the contributors.
The Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.
Thanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day. We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size. Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc. THANKS A LOT TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS!

So, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.
And stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!

What’s next?

Technical changes. 2021 will be another busy year for the Jenkins community.
There are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want Jenkins to succeed.
There are many areas on the roadmap : UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.
There will also be a continued cleanup of old dependencies and technical debt.
Several key changes are expected to land in the March LTS baseline: update to Spring Security, XStream unforking, JQuery update, etc.( announcement).
In addition to that, we will keep working on expanding platform support in Jenkins, including provisioning support for new Java versions and official images for more architectures like Arm.

Documentation. Documentation efforts will continue in the next year,
with a focus on documenting Jenkins usage on modern platforms and and automation use-cases.
Wide adoption of documentation-as-code will also continue for plugins By this time almost 600 plugins have been migrated, but there are hundreds more plugins to go.

Security. Another important area is Jenkins security. Automation tools like Jenkins are a key part of the software delivery process in organizations, and their security is essential for the security of products.
Misconfigured or outdated systems are a common attack vector, but there are also areas for improvement on the project’s side.
Be sure there will be security advisories and vulnerability fixes in 2021.
We plan to keep adopting best security development and software delivery practices, and to improve dependency management and developer tools in the project. These areas will be in the spotlight for the project next year.

Events. Next month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a virtual Jenkins stand there.
There will also be a CI/CD devroom.
If you are interested to meet Jenkins contributors, it is a great opportunity. We also plan to continue all outreach programs and on onboarding more contributors.
At the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement).
We are also ready to consider other non-coding project ideas as a part of CommunityBridge.
If you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.

Join us in 2021!

We are always looking for more contributors, regardless of the profile and experience.
Jenkins is a vast ecosystem which includes many modern technologies.

We invite Jenkins users and contributors to participate in the community and to move these initiatives forward!
Join us in the mailing lists and special interest groups,<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><a href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/markyjackson-taulia/">Marky Jackson</a>, <a aria-current="page" class="" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev/">Oleg Nenashev</a><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/community">community</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/new-year-blogpost">new-year-blogpost</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/governance">governance</a></li></ul></div></li><li class="post"><a class="body" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/2020/12/22/gsoc-report/"><div class="header"><div class="date"><div class="month">Dec</div><div class="day">22</div></div><h5 class="title">Google Summer of Code 2020 summary</h5></div><p class="teaser">With the mentor summit and the project retrospectives finished in October,
now we can call Google Summer of Code 2020 officially over in the Jenkins community.
On behalf of the Jenkins org team, we would like to thank all participants: students, mentors, applicants, and dozens of other contributors who participated in the project this year.
Google Summer of Code would not be successful without the active participation of the Jenkins community.

If you follow the Jenkins blog, you may have already seen many GSoC 2020 articles created by the project teams.
Here I would like to focus on the key highlights from the project.

Projects

In 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.
We had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.
As usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.
The projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes
needed for long-term evolution of Jenkins.

Here are the projects we had this year:

Custom Jenkins distribution build service by Sladyn Nunes

External Fingerprint Storage by Sumit Sarin

Git Plugin Performance Improvements by Rishabh Budhouliya

GitHub Checks API for Jenkins Plugins by Kezhi Xiong

Jenkins X: Apps/Addons consolidation by Zixuan Liu

Machine Learning Plugins for Data Science by Loghi Perinpanayagam

Jenkins Windows Services: YAML Configuration Support by Buddhika Chathuranga

Please refer to the project pages for more information, links to the blog posts, and project demos.
Let’s focus on the results instead.
This is the first ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.
It was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!

Events

Thanks to the GSoC organization stipend from Google and other donations,
the Jenkins project usually provides travel grants to successful students so that they can visit a major community event, meet their mentors and community members in person, and present their work there.
Here are some notes about the GSoC 2019 travel.
Unfortunately this year it was not possible, and GSoC went completely virtual this year.

Online meetups

In August we organized Jenkins Online Meetups where students have presented their projects
( part 1, part 2).
You can find recordings of these presentations in this playlist on the Jenkins YouTube channel.

DevOps World

This year CloudBees, one of the Jenkins corporate sponsors, invited all students to participate in the DevOps World virtual conference on September 23-25.
GSoC students did lighting talks about their projects, attended other conference talks, and joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation booth which represented the project at the conference.
You can find recordings of the talks and all materials here.
Although the conference was in September, the talks were pre-recorded in early August.
Please refer to the Jenkins online meetup recordings for the recent versions.

GSoC Mentor summit

This is a regular gathering for Google Summer of Code mentors and org admins where they share their experiences about GSoC, outreach programs, community management, and tools.
Usually it is organized as a multi-day unconference after the end of GSoC, with 2-3 representatives from each project.
It has been a great learning experience to participate in it.
This year it was a single-day virtual event, and all mentors were able to attend.
Shivay Lamba, one of the GSoC 2020 mentors, also did a lightning talk about the GSoC projects he was working on in Jenkins and CNCF ( slides).

Swag

All Google Summer of Code students and mentors get swag from Google.
This year, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) has sponsored swag for 50 most active GSoC participants:
all students, mentors, and many other contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.
This is the third year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag,
In the previous years the swag logistics was one of the most challenging tasks for org admins during the entire project.
and we highly appreciate help from CDF with this part.
As DevOps World presenters, the students have also received special edition speaker swag from CloudBees.

Thanks a lot to Google, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) and CloudBees!

Retrospective

After completion of the coding phases,
org admins have reached out to all GSoC 2020 participants to gather their feedback and suggestions.
We also recommended that project teams hold their own retrospective meetings.
Such information is instrumental to continuously improving GSoC in the Jenkins community.
We thank all contributors who shared their feedback!

The organization-wide retrospective was organized as a survey and a series of retrospective meetings.
You can find aggregated results in this Google Doc.
Overall, we received very positive feedback from students and mentors.
The GSoC framework in Jenkins has matured significantly during the previous years.
The effort we invested to create guidelines and recommendations for all parties helped a lot because all the expectations were known in advance.
As usual, there is much to improve, especially with regards to the community bonding phases and cross-project communications.
We are processing the feedback, and we will expand our documentation and the contributor onboarding plans next year.

Some personal notes

I have been involved in leading and coordinating Google Summer of Code in open source projects since 2016.
This year I visited the GSoC stand at FOSDEM and met a few organizers and former students.
A few days after, I proposed participating in GSoC at the Jenkins contributor summit in Brussels,
and several contributors supported this idea.
We spent several hours to create the first Jenkins GSoC page and brainstorm on project ideas.
We submitted our application and were accepted.
Thanks a lot to the Google team that gave us a chance!

It is great to work with the students and see how they explore the open source community and grow professionally as engineers.
It is also awesome to see how some of them stay in the project and keep contributing,
including becoming plugin maintainers and GSoC mentors.
But, for me, Google Summer of Code is not just about mentoring.
It also helps a lot with the community bonding…​ for the existing community like Jenkins which has a lot of isolated sub-communities in plugins.
Many maintainers work alone, and it can be quite lonely working to maintain a plugin without feedback, developer ideas, and user interactions.
When plugin contributors become project mentors, they join the wider community effort and work in teams.
In many cases they start contributing to the organization-wide activities and goals,
and it grows the &quot;backbone&quot; of the Jenkins community.
Like other community-driven projects, we need such backbone to scale the community and onboard more contributors to the countless Jenkins components.
So far it works really well and GSoC excels among outreach programs in this regard.

I would like to thank the Google Open Source team, students and all Jenkins community members for the great Google Summer of Code this year.
We also thank the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help to recognize contributors and allow organization administrators to focus on projects.
Last but not least, I would like to thank the Jenkins org admin team:
Martin d’Anjou,
Marky Jackson, and
Kara de la Marck.
This was a crazy year for everyone. Regardless of that, the org admins stepped up and took responsibility for students and mentors involved in the project, with a serious time commitment.
Not all work by the organizers is publicly visible (applications, project selection, resolving conflicts),
but this work is essential to the project’s success.
Thanks a lot to org admins and mentors who helped with the administrative tasks this year!

What’s about GSoC 2021?

Yes, we plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021.
The application period for organizations will start in a few months,
but we have already started preparing for the next GSoC session.
We are looking for mentors, org admins and project ideas.
Please contact us if you are interested!

Call for Mentors and Project Ideas

GSoC 2021 project ideas

HOWTO: Propose a project idea

Information for mentors : guidelines and expectations

We invite potential students to start exploring the project and the available project ideas.
Original ideas are always welcome in the project, and starting early is a great opportunity to
get introduced to the Jenkins community, collect more information about the problem areas,
and to create a good proposal.
&quot;Start early&quot; is the most popular recommendation from GSoC 2020 participants to future GSoC students,
and we encourage you to follow this advice!<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><a aria-current="page" class="" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev/">Oleg Nenashev</a><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/gsoc">gsoc</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/gsoc2020">gsoc2020</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/jenkins">jenkins</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/community">community</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/events">events</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/mentor">mentor</a></li></ul></div></li><li class="post"><a class="body" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/2020/12/03/election-results/"><div class="header"><div class="date"><div class="month">Dec</div><div class="day"> 3</div></div><h5 class="title">2020 Jenkins Board and Officer Elections Results</h5></div><p class="teaser">The Jenkins community has recently completed the 2020 elections.

we congratulate all newly elected board members and officers!
We also thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.

Election results:

Gavin Mogan and Marky Jackson will join
Kohsuke Kawaguchi, Ullrich Hafner and Oleg Nenashev
on the Jenkins Governance Board

Tim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer

Marky Jackson will become the new Events Officer (uncontested)

Olivier Vernin will continue in the role of Infrastructure Officer for another term (uncontested)

Daniel Beck will continue in the role of Security Officer for another term (uncontested)

Mark Waite will continue in the role of Documentation Officer for another term (uncontested)

The board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins&#x27; community governance and well-being,
and we are excited to see contributors taking these roles.
If you are interested to learn more, please see the blog post below.

Governance Board election details

This year we had nine candidates participating in Jenkins Governance Board elections:
Andrey Falko, Ewelina Wilkosz, Frederic Gurr, Gavin Mogan, Justin Harringa,
Mark Waite, Marky Jackson, Steven Terrana, and Zhao Xiaojie (Rick).
All of them are awesome community leaders who actively contribute to the Jenkins project and
represent its users.
It would be an honor to have them on the Jenkins board.
Regardless of the election results, we appreciate their participation and the time they invested in these elections.

This year we were electing 2 governance board members.
We were using the Condorcet Internet Voting Service that allows voters to rank their choices rather than just picking their one favorite choice.
You can find full voting results here :

Mark Waite  (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)

Marky Jackson loses to Mark Waite by 48–12

Gavin Mogan loses to Mark Waite by 51–10, loses to Marky Jackson by 31–20

Ewelina Wilkosz  loses to Mark Waite by 48–14, loses to Gavin Mogan by 29–28

Justin Harringa  loses to Mark Waite by 51–11, loses to Ewelina Wilkosz by 35–16

Steven Terrana  loses to Mark Waite by 47–16, loses to Justin Harringa by 20–19

Zhao Xiaojie (Rick)  loses to Mark Waite by 57–5, loses to Steven Terrana by 25–24

Frederic Gurr  loses to Mark Waite by 52–10, loses to Zhao Xiaojie (Rick) by 25–24

Andrey Falko  loses to Mark Waite by 56–6, loses to Frederic Gurr by 26–13

Although Mark Waite came first in the voting results,
being on the board would violate the Corporate Involvement clause which states that
&quot;the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%&quot;.
Mark will continue to be Documentation officer.
Regardless of his official role, Mark has been leading many initiatives and helping a lot with various aspects of the community governance.

Congratulations to Marky and Gavin, and thanks to all candidates!
All new board members are elected for a 2-year term unless they decide to step down earlier.
The estimated end of the term for them is December 02, 2022.
We would also like to thank Alex Earl and R. Tyler Croy who step down from the Jenkins Governance Board this year.
Thanks to them for all contributions and for continued community leadership.

Statement from Marky Jackson:

It is a tremendous honor to be elected to this roles. I am so humbled.
Being part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.
My goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.
I look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.

— Marky Jackson, Jenkins Governance Board Member and Events Officer

Statement from Gavin Mogan:

Gavin here. I’m still in shock that I got voted in for the Jenkins board.
It felt like yesterday I just got started helping people randomly on IRC. This is truly exciting.
I plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.
This is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.
My specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.

— Gavin Mogan, Jenkins Governance Board Member

Officer election details

All 5 officer positions were up for election this year.
These roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2021.
After the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,
4 officer positions were uncontested:

Olivier Vernin - Infrastructure officer.

Marky Jackson - Events officer.
Marky inherits this role from Alyssa Tong
who decided to step down from the officer role and to focus on the Jenkins community marketing,
including Jenkins Is The Way and many other initiatives started by Alyssa.

Mark Waite - Documentation officer.

Daniel Beck - Security officer.

Thanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!
Officers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.
It requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.

Release Officer election results

Tim Jacomb won the biggest support as a Release officer ( voting results).
Tim will replace in this role Oliver Gondža
who has been leading the Release Team and the release processes since 2016 when the role was officially introduced.

Tim Jacomb (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)

Baptiste Mathus  loses to Tim Jacomb by 40–23

Victor Martinez  loses to Tim Jacomb by 38–25, loses to Baptiste Mathus by 32–31

Here is a statement from Tim Jacomb:

I’m excited for the year ahead, let’s see where we can take the Jenkins release area in the future.
As a Release Officer I would like to increase automation, ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team,
and ensure that responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.

— Tim Jacomb, Jenkins Release Officer

Thanks to Alyssa Tong and Oliver Gondža for their long-time service as Jenkins officers!
We are looking to continue working with them in the Jenkins community.
And congratulations to Tim Jacomb and Marky Jackson for joining the team!

Statistics

This year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.
It is significantly lower than in the 2019 elections when we had almost 350 voters.
It can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.
This year we decided to not use the previous voter registration system,
and we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.
This is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.

What’s next for the board?

The last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.
With help of many contributors and with the renewed board,
we have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,
for example hosting contributor summits,
publishing the public roadmap,
Code of Conduct update,
terminology changes,
and graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.
There is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.

In short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.
The board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes
(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.

There are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:
long-anticipated features and architecture changes,
changing the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process,
creating better communication channels with Jenkins users,
and onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.
Such initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.
The ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.
If you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,
it is definitely a great time to contribute!

Feedback

Jenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.
We will appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process so that we can improve the process.
We have started a Retrospective document for these elections.
Everyone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.
There will be also a public retrospective review at the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meeting on Dec 17.

If you have any private feedback you would like to share,
please send an email to the Jenkins Board.
If you would like to raise any issues about the election process,
please contact one of the elected Governance Board members.

Minimum copy-editing was applied to the content by the Jenkins 2020 Elections Committee.
Candidates are sorted by the first name.

Governance Board

Andrey Falko

I have been a Jenkins user and administrator on and off since around 2010.
In 2016, I got into evangelism by organizing a
Jenkins Area Meetup in San Francisco.
I spoke at Jenkins World 2017
and again at
Jenkins World 2018.
Justin Harringa and I wrote and open sourced the Config Driven Pipeline Plugin.
For two years running, I’ve been a mentor for two Google Summer of Code projects:
External Fingerprint Storage Project and
Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features.

With this nomination, I hope to continue helping strengthen and
progress the community further. As a member of the governance board,
I’ll bring a fresh perspective by asking questions, providing feedback,
and finding opportunities for others to contribute.

Ewelina Wilkosz

As a consultant I support my customers with their Jenkins issues since the beginning of 2017.
And almost from the start it was some kind of &quot;as code&quot; approach.
The experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.
I consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.
I appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is.

I am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience
with Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.
Every day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.
As a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.

Thanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development
I had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations
where I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.
Here are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:
blogpost,
cdCON presentation,
podcast recording.
So my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,
so I actually know what they need and why.

Frederic Gurr

I started to use Jenkins back in 2008, when it still had a different name.
In 2011 I started to contribute and created my first little plugin called
extra-columns.
Since then, using and administering Jenkins servers has become a major part of my work life,
while getting involved with the Jenkins community
kickstarted my interest and involvement with open source software and communities.

I’ve been working as a release engineer at the Eclipse Foundation since 2016,
supporting 250+ Jenkins instances for various open source projects.
I’d be honored to bring a user and admin oriented perspective to the Governance Board and help
shape the future of Jenkins.

Gavin Mogan

I got started with Jenkins early on when I was just getting started with testing.
I knew there had to be a way to run the tests automatically and report on them back to people.
I started hacking my own tools before I came across Jenkins (then Hudson) and was hooked ever since.
Over the years I’ve managed to install and configure Jenkins at various jobs,
and even was employed making internal and external plugins and integrations.
You’ll often find me on the Jenkins IRC and Gitter channels as well as the subreddit giving a hand to people who are stuck.
I also try to get involved with Jenkins Infrastructure projects as much as I can.
I currently maintain the plugin site, plugin site API, Jenkins Wiki exporter, and a bunch of other minor projects.
I also help run Vancouver’s chapter of Nodeschool.

If elected, I would like to address improving commercial support avenues.
Right now it’s a lot of people flailing in isolation.
I would like to not only improve things so people can find easier ways to get help,
but also encourage more users to help others, and push for a
centralized source of companies providing commercial support.

Justin Harringa

The nomination is quite an honor for me.
I have been a Hudson/Jenkins user since around 2009/2010 when
I started working through driving continuous integration in a corporate environment at John Deere.
As time went on, I began contributing some small fixes to plugins such as the Job DSL Plugin, OpenID Plugin, and the Workflow Job Plugin.
Eventually, I ended up helping maintain Salesforce’s Chatter plugin and then open sourcing plugins such as the Config-Driven Pipeline Plugin with Andrey Falko.
More recently, I have also had the extreme pleasure of mentoring in 2 Jenkins projects for Google Summer of Code
(Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab in 2019 and Git Plugin Performance Improvements in 2020).

I have learned so much from working with Jenkins and I would love to give back to the project further.
Having introduced Jenkins at both small and large companies,
I would love to help contribute to the direction of the project through the Roadmap/SIGs/JEPs and encourage others to also contribute / improve Jenkins.

Mark Waite

I’m a Jenkins contributor, a member of the Jenkins core team,
one of the leaders of the Platform Special Interest Group,
and leader of the Documentation Special Interest Group.
I’ve served as the Jenkins Documentation Officer since 2019.
I was a mentor for Google Season of Code 2020 and am one of the maintainers of the Git plugin for Jenkins.

If elected and allowed to serve on the Jenkins Board, I’ll work to increase community involvement and community development.
I’m deeply interested in tooling and environments that support the Jenkins project,
including the Jenkins CI environments, issue tracker, artifact repository, and source code repositories.

Marky Jackson

I have been involved in the Jenkins project for many years.
I started out as a plugin maintainer, SIG member and general helper.
I moved to a SIG lead, speakers and Google Summer of Code and Docs org admin and mentor.
My current goals are to help continue the work of the public roadmap as well and gain most community members by continuing to be a champion of the community.

For me, being on the Jenkins Board is another opportunity to improve upon the great work
we have all done as well as work toward branching out our efforts to have more women, people of color and LGBTQIA members.
I would be honored to have this opportunity.

Steven Terrana

I have been a Jenkins user since 2017 and contributor since 2018.
I am the primary maintainer of the Jenkins Templating Engine,
a plugin that allows users to create truly templated Jenkins pipelines that can be shared across teams.
Through that work, I’ve had the great pleasure of helping to organize the Pipeline Authoring Special Interest Group,
contributing to the Jenkins Pipeline documentation, and contributing bug fixes to various plugins
(including the pipeline plugin and workflow-cps library).

As a Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador,
I’ve enjoyed doing what I can to advance the community’s approach to CI/CD and simplifying DevSecOps adoption within large organizations.
It would be a privilege to serve on the Jenkins Governance Board and offer my support wherever I can.

Zhao Xiaojie (Rick)

Three years ago I joined the Jenkins community.
I learned a lot during the process of contributing.
I even became a Jenkins hero in my city.
The most exciting thing I want to do is help more new users of Jenkins get started, and let more contributors feel comfortable.
I always love to host a JAM no matter if it’s online or offline.

Plans: improve the experience of using Jenkins in different
countries; reorganize the knowledge of Jenkins, for example the tutorial
by text or video format; help other SIG leaders to organize meetings.

Release Officer

Baptiste Mathus

I have been using and contributing to Jenkins for so long that it is difficult for me to check when it started exactly.
My first pull-request to Jenkins was in 2011 and I had started to use it long before it.
Throughout the years, I have contributed to various areas:
created our local Jenkins Area Meetup with Michaël Pailloncy,
helped users and developers on our mailing lists and IRC channels,
contributed to the Jenkins infrastructure, the website,
processing plugins hosting requests, worked full time on Jenkins Evergreen,
and I am still present today.

For all these reasons, it would be an honor to serve as the Release Officer for the Jenkins Project.

Tim Jacomb

I have been a user of Jenkins for the last 8 years and a regular contributor since 2018.
I began with maintaining the Slack plugin and over the last couple of years I have since expanded that to many more plugins and the Jenkins core.
These are some of the components I maintain when I have time: Slack, Azure Key Vault, Junit,
most of the Database plugins, Dark theme, Plugin installation manager, Jenkins Helm chart, Configuration as code plugin.
I am also a member of the Jenkins infrastructure team,
and I was involved in the release automation project and the mirrors modernisation effort,
along with the day to day support helping people regain access to accounts etc.

As a Release Officer I would like to increase automation,
ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team, and ensure that
responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.

Victor Martinez

I have been involved in the Jenkins project since 2011 by different means, as a user, as an administrator, as a contributor
(bug reporting, plugin development, documentation, hackfest),
being active in the different Jenkins forums such as the Jenkins-dev and Jenkins-user mailing lists,
working with the jenkins-infra shared library and so on.
I’m also an advocate for the Jenkins project through some presentations anytime that I had the opportunity such as
DevOps World 2020 and
Jenkins World 2017.

I’ve been happily nominated for the Release officer role which matches not just my area of professional expertise that
I’ve been doing for the last 14 years in different roles for different companies but also that’s an area of personal interest
where I’d like to spend time with the Jenkins community to understand, document and automate the process
in a way we can keep the project sustainable for a long term as it’s today,
it’s not just about what I can bring for the community but also about growing together.

If elected as a Release officer I would aim to focus on the following areas:
proceed with the existing responsibilities for this role;
document and automate the release process;
being an enabler for the Continuous Delivery not just for the plugins but also for the core.

Security Officer - uncontested

Daniel Beck

I’ve been a Jenkins user since 2011, contributor since 2013, and core maintainer since 2014.
In 2015, I took on the scheduling and authoring of security advisories and have been doing that ever since,
working with reporters, maintainers, and the Jenkins security team to deliver security fixes.
Beyond that, I regularly contribute to Jenkins and project infrastructure.

Since I’ve started in the Security Officer role, we’ve made significant
improvements:
Plugins no longer allow ordinary users to run arbitrary scripts (no sandbox!) as a regular feature. I introduced fine-grained permission management
for our GitHub repositories and
the Maven repository hosting our releases.
Warnings directly in Jenkins inform admins when an installed component has known security issues (and their UX was improved earlier this year).
The Jenkins project is now a CVE Numbers Authority,
to ensure timely and high-quality information in the CVE vulnerability database.
Working with Tyler, I added telemetry to Jenkins,
which allowed us to deliver multiple large-scale security fixes with
minimal impact.
More recently, I’ve started writing code scanning rules for common problems in Jenkins and
invited maintainers to sign their plugins up,
which is something I hope to properly publish and roll out more widely soon.

Events Officer - uncontested

Marky Jackson

I have been a part of the Jenkins community for some time, and I have received the utmost joy in volunteering.
I have been extremely fortunate to have played a lead role in the Outreach &amp; Advocacy SIG, the pipeline-Authoring SIG,
and, most recently, the Cloud-Native SIG.
I have taken part in many meetups, org admin, and mentor in the GSoC &amp; GSoD.
Finally, At DevOps World 2020, I received Jenkins most valuable advocate at DevOps World.
I have experience advocating in other communities as well:
Kubernetes Release Manager Associate, Kubernetes Mentoring Lead, Ortelius Community Manager.

Jenkins is the most widely used Continuous Integration tool around,
and I want to continue to promote that by focusing on the following areas: meetups; conference presentation from the Jenkins community;
new user outreach and onboarding; cross-community collaboration (e.g., Kubernetes community);
working with the Continuous Delivery Foundation on interoperability; focusing on SIG events.

My roots are open-source, and I am so proud to be a part of the Jenkins community.
You can read more about my journey in open-source here.
You can also see some of my presentations here and

Infrastructure Officer - uncontested

Olivier Vernin

I have been actively contributing to the Jenkins project for the past four years with contributions across many areas,
and infrastructure is one of my favorite topics.
Over my previous mandate as a Jenkins infrastructure officer, I focused on improving contribution experience,
and let community members opportunities to take ownership of the different services.
I worked on various sponsoring initiatives to make the Jenkins infrastructure more sustainable.
We provided a new environment for releasing Jenkins core (and one plugin!), and also many more things.

For the coming year, It is hard to make commitments on what it will look like as we have things we know,
like services that need some attention (“ci.jenkins.io/) and the things we don’t know yet.
Anyway, It’s important to me to have a transparent project where everybody could read, learn, participate,
and understand how the Jenkins project manages infrastructure and I want to continue down that path.

I’ve served as the Jenkins Documentation Officer since 2019.
I was a mentor for Google Season of Code 2020 and am one of the maintainers of the Git plugin for Jenkins.

If elected and allowed to serve as Documentation Officer,
I’ll continue efforts to invite more contributors through regular Documentation Office Hours and outreach programs like Google Season of Docs, CommunityBridge, Outreachy, and Jenkins Hackfests.
I’ll work to assure an inviting and welcoming environment for contributors.

the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).
This status is officially effective Aug 03, 2020.
Jenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.
Thanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!

In this article, we will discuss what the CD Foundation membership and graduation mean to the Jenkins community.
We will also talk about what changed in Jenkins as a part of the graduation,
and what are the future steps for the project.

To know more about the Jenkins graduation,
see also the announcement on the CD Foundation website.
Also see the special edition of the CD Foundation Newsletter for Jenkins user success stories and some surprise content.
The press release is available here.

How does CDF membership help us?

About 18 months ago, Jenkins became one of the CDF founding projects, along with Jenkins X, Spinnaker and Tekton.
A new foundation was formed to provide a vendor-neutral home for open source projects used for Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration.
Special interest groups were started to foster collaboration between projects and end user companies,
most notably:
Interoperability,
MLOps and
Security SIGs.
Also, a Community Ambassador role was created to organize local meetups and to provide public-facing community representatives.
Many former Jenkins Ambassadors and other contributors are now CDF Ambassadors, and they promote Jenkins and other projects there.

Thanks to this membership we addressed key project infrastructure needs.
Starting from Jan 2020, CDF covers a significant part of the infrastructure costs
including our services and CI/CD instances running on Microsoft Azure.
The CD Foundation provided us with legal assistance required to get code signing keys for the Jenkins project.
Thanks to that, we were able to switch to a new Jenkins Release Infrastructure.
The foundation sponsors the Zoom account we use for Jenkins Online Meetups and community meetings.
In the future we will continue to review ways of reducing maintenance overhead by switching some of our self-hosted services to equivalents provided by the Linux Foundation to CDF members.

Another important CDF membership benefit is community outreach and marketing.
It helped us to establish connections with other CI/CD projects and end user companies.
Through the foundation we have access to the DevStats service
that provides community contribution statistics and helps us track trends and discover areas for improvement.
On the marketing side, the foundation organizes webinars, podcasts and newsletters.
Jenkins is regularly represented there.
The CD Foundation also runs the meetup.com professional account which is used by local Jenkins communities for
CI/CD and Jenkins Area Meetups.
Last but not least, the Jenkins community is also represented at virtual conferences where CDF has a booth.
All of that helps to grow Jenkins visibility and to highlight new features and initiatives in the project.

Why did we graduate?

The Jenkins project has a long history of open governance which is a key part of today’s project success.
Starting from 2011, the project has introduced the governance meeting which are open to anyone.
Most of the discussions and decision making happen publicly in the mailing lists.
In 2015 we introduced teams, sub-projects and officer roles.
In 2017 we introduced the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process which helped us to make the key architecture and governance decisions more open and transparent to the community and the Jenkins users.
In 2018 we introduced special interest groups that focus on community needs.
In 2019 we have expanded the Jenkins governance board
so that it got more bandwidth to facilitate initiatives in the project.

Since the Jenkins project inception 15 years ago, it has been steadily growing.
Now it has millions of users and thousands of contributors.
In 2019 it has seen 5,433 contributors from 111 countries and 272 companies,
67 core and 2,654 plugin releases,
45,484 commits, 7,000+ pull requests.
In 2020 Q2 the project has seen 21% growth in pull requests numbers compared to 2019 Q2, bots excluded.

One may say that the Jenkins project already has everything needed to succeed.
It is a result of continuous work by many community members,
and this work will never end as long as the project remains active.
Like in any other industry, the CI/CD ecosystem changes every day and sets new expectations from the automation tools in this domain.
Just as the tools evolve, open source communities need to evolve so that they can address expectations, and onboard more users and contributors.
The CDF graduation process helped us to discover opportunities for improvement,
and address them.
We reviewed the project processes and compared them with the Graduated Project criteria defined in the CDF project lifecycle.
Based on this review, we made changes in our processes and documentation.
It should improve the experience of Jenkins users,
and help to make the Jenkins community more welcoming to existing and newcomer contributors.

What changed for the project?

Below you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:

Public roadmap

We introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.
This roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.
It makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters,
and at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.
The roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in jep:14[].

More details about the public roadmap are coming next week, stay tuned for a separate blogpost.
On July 10th we had an online contributor meetup about the roadmap
and you can find more information in its materials
( slides, video recording).

User Documentation

Jenkins Weekly Release line is now documented on our website ( here).
We have also reworked the downloads page and added guidelines explaining how to verify downloads.

A new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.
This list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,
including ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.
Please do not hesitate to add your company there!

Community

We passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.
This certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices
and to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).
It also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.
Details are on the Jenkins core page.

Jenkins Code of Conduct was updated
to the new version of Contributor Covenant.
In particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.

The default Jenkins contributing template was updated to cover more common cases for plugin contributors.
This page provides links to the Participate and Contribute guidelines hosted on our website,
and helps potential contributors to easily access the documentation.

The Jenkins Core maintainer guide was updated to include maintenance and issues triage guidelines.
It should help us to deliver quality releases and to timely triage and address issues reported by Jenkins users.

What’s next?

It an honor to be the first project to reach the graduated stage in the Continuous Delivery Foundation,
but it is also a great responsibility for the project.
As a project, we plan to continue participating in the CDF activities and to work with other projects and end users to maintain the Jenkins&#x27; leader role in the CI/CD space.

We encourage everyone to join the project and participate in evolving the Jenkins project and driving its roadmap.
It does not necessarily mean committing code or documentation patches;
user feedback is also very important to the project.
If you are interested to contribute or to share your feedback,
please contact us in the Jenkins community channels ( mailing lists, chats)!

About the Continuous Delivery Foundation

The Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) serves as the vendor-neutral home of many of the fastest-growing projects for continuous delivery, including Jenkins, Jenkins X, Tekton, and Spinnaker,
as well as fosters collaboration between the industry’s top developers, end users and vendors to further continuous delivery best practices.
The CDF is part of the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization.
For more information about the foundation, please visit its website.
