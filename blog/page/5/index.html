Other</h5></div><p class="teaser">The Jenkins community congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!
Let’s take a look at some changes this year.
We would like to thank all awesome Jenkins users and contributors who have been with us during this year.

Highlights

Some of the key highlights:

Hundreds of first-timer contributors joined the community

Major UI/UX improvements in the Jenkins core, including the landing page, plugin manager, dark theme, and read-only configurations support

Outreach programs like Google Summer of Code (7 projects), Google Season of Docs, UI/UX hackfest, etc.

Public roadmap for the project

Terminology changes in the project, new Code of Conduct

Technical debt cleanup: XStream unforking, Acegi Security replacement, etc.

Continued evolution of the plugin ecosystem, especially in the area of Cloud Native solutions and tool integrations

Continued documentation cleanup, great progress with plugin documentation migration

Graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation

Jenkins User Interface and User Experience

This year there were many activities around Jenkins user experience and long-anticipated user interface changes.
This is a coordinated effort being led by the User Experience SIG, and by many contributors to the project.
Key project highlights:

Look &amp; Feel updates of the Jenkins Web UI, including styling rework, new typography and layouts

Major rework of plugin management UI/UX

Dark theme for Jenkins

Accessibility improvements

Support for read-only configuration pages

In May we also organized a Jenkins UI/UX hackfest where we worked on some key stories improving user experience.

Jenkins security

In 2020 the Jenkins security team has released 19 advisories for the Jenkins core, plugins and other components.
In total 198 vulnerabilities were fixed, and 72 plugin vulnerabilities were announced without a fix at the time of advisory publishing.
As a project, we are receiving a continuous flow of new reports and continue to provide corrections.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were the most popular type this year, followed by unprotected credentials.

There have also been developer tooling improvements,
including GitHub CodeQL evaluation for targeted security issues search
and Find-Sec-Bugs adoption for static analysis of the plugin and Jenkins core code.
Along with wider adoption of Dependabot and automated dependency scanning on GitHub.

Documentation

Jenkins Documentation SIG is working on creating more documentation for Jenkins on different platforms,
including cloud platforms.
Jenkins on Kubernetes was one of the key stories this year for the SIG,
along with documentation migration to jenkins.io and wider adoption of Documentation-as-code in plugins.
95% of the 200 most installed Jenkins plugins have moved to &quot;documentation as code&quot; or have a pending pull request with updates.
In total, almost 600 plugins have already been migrated.
There were major updates in Jenkins documentation on jenkins.io, with a lot of content being moved from the old Jenkins Wiki.

2020 was the first year when Jenkins participated in Google Season of Docs (GSoD).
This program brings together open-source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.
This year’s student, Zainab Abubakar,
did an amazing job documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes.
Now Jenkins users can find official documentation about deploying and scaling Jenkins in Kubernetes.
See the project report by Zainab here.

Jenkins Release Automation

The Jenkins project has delivered weekly and long term support releases since it was formed in 2011.
Those releases were delivered by Kohsuke Kawaguchi from his release infrastructure.

Beginning in April 2020, those releases are delivered by the new release automation setup.
It is hosted within the Jenkins’ Kubernetes cluster, with fully automated management and continuous delivery of services within the setup.
We transitioned to new build processes, new code signing certificates, and new release automation jobs.
Thanks to Olivier Vernin and all Infrastructure sub-project contributors for the successful completion of the release automation project!

Moreover, there is ongoing work on continuous delivery of Jenkins plugins ( JEP-229) and on re-designing other Jenkins instances within the project (infra-ci, trusted-ci, and ci.jenkins.io for plugins).
In the next few months these stories should provide Jenkins contributors with a modern environment for CI and CD of all Jenkins components.

Terminology updates

Since July, we have officially replaced the old &quot;master&quot; terminology with the &quot;controller&quot; term.
It is a follow-up to the &quot;agent&quot; terminology introduced in 2016.
We have also deprecated usages of the “blacklist/whitelist” terminology in all components.
Currently the community is working on the cleanup of the remaining occurrences in the codebase and documentation, and we invite everyone to contribute.

As a part of the terminology cleanup, last spring we announced the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.
As a reminder, it does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.

See more information about terminology updates here and here.

“Jenkins is the Way” program

This year the Advocacy and Outreach SIG started the “Jenkins is the Way” initiative which focuses on promoting user success stories.
Over the year, the team published 54 user stories and six case studies on https://jenkinsistheway.io/ as well as a significant amount of community marketing.
We also published a number of testimonial videos advertising user stories,
including this Introduction to &quot;Jenkins is the Way&quot; video.

See all the stories HERE

Events

Google Summer of Code

In 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.
We had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.
As usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.
The projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes needed for the long-term evolution of Jenkins.

This is the first-ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.
It was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!

Jenkins in Hacktoberfest 2020

In October we participated in Hacktoberfest.
Our featured projects included the Jenkins core, jenkins.io website and plugins.jenkins.io, Helm charts, and multiple plugins.
We also encouraged contributors to participate in the Documentation as Code and terminology cleanup across the entire Jenkins ecosystem.

See the details in the Hacktoberfest page.

In total we received 226 pull requests from Hacktoberfest participants.
Some stats per Jenkins GitHub organization:

&#x27;jenkinsci&#x27;, PRs: 189, Hacktoberfest contributors: 61

&#x27;jenkins-infra&#x27;, PRs: 100, Hacktoberfest contributors: 40

&#x27;jenkins-zh&#x27;, PRs: 37, Hacktoberfest contributors: 2

Jenkins at DevOps World

The annual DevOps World,
formerly known as DevOps World | Jenkins World held on Sept 22-24, with workshops on Sept 25.
Just like other events in 2020, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that didn’t mean there was a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There were over 50 Jenkins/open-source.
And a special congratulations is in order to this year’s Jenkins Contributor Award winners:

James Holderness - Jenkins security MVP

Marky Jackson - Most valuable Jenkins advocate

Tim Jacomb - Most valuable Jenkins contributor

Below are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :

Jenkins Where It Is and Where It Is Going

One Jenkins to Rule them All

Jenkins UI Gets a Makeover

Jenkins Pipeline and DevSecOps for API Security

Graduation at Continuous Delivery Foundation

Jenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.
In August the project announced that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).
Thanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!
Below you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:

We introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.
This roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.
It makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters, and at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.
The roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in JEP-14.

A new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.
This list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,
including ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.
Please do not hesitate to add your company there!

We passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.
This certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices and to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).
It also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.
Details are on the Jenkins core page.

Jenkins Code of Conduct was updated to the new version of Contributor Covenant.
In particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.

More information can be found HERE, and HERE.

Public Roadmap

The Jenkins project now has a public, community-driven project roadmap.  Roadmap items are major initiatives and are considered as official plans.
The roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all areas of the project.

Many of the 2020 released roadmap items are mentioned elsewhere in this document, including release automation, Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification,
user interface improvements, read-only configuration pages,
and Google Summer of Code projects like the GitHub Checks API or External Fingerprint Storage.

Other roadmap items include mirror infrastructure improvements, a new Windows installer,
and preview releases of pluggable storage for external fingerprints, build logs, and unit test results.

Jenkins 2020 Elections

In October-December the Jenkins community held the regular elections.
This year we were  electing for 2 governance board members and for all five officer positions, namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation. These roles are an essential part of Jenkins&#x27; community governance and well-being. We thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.

Key results:

Gavin Mogan and Marky Jackson joined the Jenkins Governance Board

Tim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer

Marky Jackson became the new Events Officer

Olivier Vernin, Daniel Beck, and Mark Waite will continue as Infrastructure, Security and Documentation officers

Full election results: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/03/election-results/

And even more

This blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project,
it is just a slice of the key highlights mentioned by the contributors.
The Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.
Thanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day. We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size. Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc. THANKS A LOT TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS!

So, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.
And stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!

What’s next?

Technical changes. 2021 will be another busy year for the Jenkins community.
There are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want Jenkins to succeed.
There are many areas on the roadmap : UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.
There will also be a continued cleanup of old dependencies and technical debt.
Several key changes are expected to land in the March LTS baseline: update to Spring Security, XStream unforking, JQuery update, etc.( announcement).
In addition to that, we will keep working on expanding platform support in Jenkins, including provisioning support for new Java versions and official images for more architectures like Arm.

Documentation. Documentation efforts will continue in the next year,
with a focus on documenting Jenkins usage on modern platforms and and automation use-cases.
Wide adoption of documentation-as-code will also continue for plugins By this time almost 600 plugins have been migrated, but there are hundreds more plugins to go.

Security. Another important area is Jenkins security. Automation tools like Jenkins are a key part of the software delivery process in organizations, and their security is essential for the security of products.
Misconfigured or outdated systems are a common attack vector, but there are also areas for improvement on the project’s side.
Be sure there will be security advisories and vulnerability fixes in 2021.
We plan to keep adopting best security development and software delivery practices, and to improve dependency management and developer tools in the project. These areas will be in the spotlight for the project next year.

Events. Next month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a virtual Jenkins stand there.
There will also be a CI/CD devroom.
If you are interested to meet Jenkins contributors, it is a great opportunity. We also plan to continue all outreach programs and on onboarding more contributors.
At the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement).
We are also ready to consider other non-coding project ideas as a part of CommunityBridge.
If you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.

Join us in 2021!

We are always looking for more contributors, regardless of the profile and experience.
Jenkins is a vast ecosystem which includes many modern technologies.

We invite Jenkins users and contributors to participate in the community and to move these initiatives forward!
Join us in the mailing lists and special interest groups,<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><a href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/markyjackson-taulia/">Marky Jackson</a>, <a href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev/">Oleg Nenashev</a><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/community">community</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/new-year-blogpost">new-year-blogpost</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/governance">governance</a></li></ul></div></li><li class="post"><a class="body" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/2020/12/22/gsoc-report/"><div class="header"><div class="date"><div class="month">Dec</div><div class="day">22</div></div><h5 class="title">Google Summer of Code 2020 summary</h5></div><p class="teaser">With the mentor summit and the project retrospectives finished in October,
now we can call Google Summer of Code 2020 officially over in the Jenkins community.
On behalf of the Jenkins org team, we would like to thank all participants: students, mentors, applicants, and dozens of other contributors who participated in the project this year.
Google Summer of Code would not be successful without the active participation of the Jenkins community.

If you follow the Jenkins blog, you may have already seen many GSoC 2020 articles created by the project teams.
Here I would like to focus on the key highlights from the project.

Projects

In 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.
We had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.
As usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.
The projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes
needed for long-term evolution of Jenkins.

Here are the projects we had this year:

Custom Jenkins distribution build service by Sladyn Nunes

External Fingerprint Storage by Sumit Sarin

Git Plugin Performance Improvements by Rishabh Budhouliya

GitHub Checks API for Jenkins Plugins by Kezhi Xiong

Jenkins X: Apps/Addons consolidation by Zixuan Liu

Machine Learning Plugins for Data Science by Loghi Perinpanayagam

Jenkins Windows Services: YAML Configuration Support by Buddhika Chathuranga

Please refer to the project pages for more information, links to the blog posts, and project demos.
Let’s focus on the results instead.
This is the first ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.
It was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!

Events

Thanks to the GSoC organization stipend from Google and other donations,
the Jenkins project usually provides travel grants to successful students so that they can visit a major community event, meet their mentors and community members in person, and present their work there.
Here are some notes about the GSoC 2019 travel.
Unfortunately this year it was not possible, and GSoC went completely virtual this year.

Online meetups

In August we organized Jenkins Online Meetups where students have presented their projects
( part 1, part 2).
You can find recordings of these presentations in this playlist on the Jenkins YouTube channel.

DevOps World

This year CloudBees, one of the Jenkins corporate sponsors, invited all students to participate in the DevOps World virtual conference on September 23-25.
GSoC students did lighting talks about their projects, attended other conference talks, and joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation booth which represented the project at the conference.
You can find recordings of the talks and all materials here.
Although the conference was in September, the talks were pre-recorded in early August.
Please refer to the Jenkins online meetup recordings for the recent versions.

GSoC Mentor summit

This is a regular gathering for Google Summer of Code mentors and org admins where they share their experiences about GSoC, outreach programs, community management, and tools.
Usually it is organized as a multi-day unconference after the end of GSoC, with 2-3 representatives from each project.
It has been a great learning experience to participate in it.
This year it was a single-day virtual event, and all mentors were able to attend.
Shivay Lamba, one of the GSoC 2020 mentors, also did a lightning talk about the GSoC projects he was working on in Jenkins and CNCF ( slides).

Swag

All Google Summer of Code students and mentors get swag from Google.
This year, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) has sponsored swag for 50 most active GSoC participants:
all students, mentors, and many other contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.
This is the third year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag,
In the previous years the swag logistics was one of the most challenging tasks for org admins during the entire project.
and we highly appreciate help from CDF with this part.
As DevOps World presenters, the students have also received special edition speaker swag from CloudBees.

Thanks a lot to Google, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) and CloudBees!

Retrospective

After completion of the coding phases,
org admins have reached out to all GSoC 2020 participants to gather their feedback and suggestions.
We also recommended that project teams hold their own retrospective meetings.
Such information is instrumental to continuously improving GSoC in the Jenkins community.
We thank all contributors who shared their feedback!

The organization-wide retrospective was organized as a survey and a series of retrospective meetings.
You can find aggregated results in this Google Doc.
Overall, we received very positive feedback from students and mentors.
The GSoC framework in Jenkins has matured significantly during the previous years.
The effort we invested to create guidelines and recommendations for all parties helped a lot because all the expectations were known in advance.
As usual, there is much to improve, especially with regards to the community bonding phases and cross-project communications.
We are processing the feedback, and we will expand our documentation and the contributor onboarding plans next year.

Some personal notes

I have been involved in leading and coordinating Google Summer of Code in open source projects since 2016.
This year I visited the GSoC stand at FOSDEM and met a few organizers and former students.
A few days after, I proposed participating in GSoC at the Jenkins contributor summit in Brussels,
and several contributors supported this idea.
We spent several hours to create the first Jenkins GSoC page and brainstorm on project ideas.
We submitted our application and were accepted.
Thanks a lot to the Google team that gave us a chance!

It is great to work with the students and see how they explore the open source community and grow professionally as engineers.
It is also awesome to see how some of them stay in the project and keep contributing,
including becoming plugin maintainers and GSoC mentors.
But, for me, Google Summer of Code is not just about mentoring.
It also helps a lot with the community bonding…​ for the existing community like Jenkins which has a lot of isolated sub-communities in plugins.
Many maintainers work alone, and it can be quite lonely working to maintain a plugin without feedback, developer ideas, and user interactions.
When plugin contributors become project mentors, they join the wider community effort and work in teams.
In many cases they start contributing to the organization-wide activities and goals,
and it grows the &quot;backbone&quot; of the Jenkins community.
Like other community-driven projects, we need such backbone to scale the community and onboard more contributors to the countless Jenkins components.
So far it works really well and GSoC excels among outreach programs in this regard.

I would like to thank the Google Open Source team, students and all Jenkins community members for the great Google Summer of Code this year.
We also thank the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help to recognize contributors and allow organization administrators to focus on projects.
Last but not least, I would like to thank the Jenkins org admin team:
Martin d’Anjou,
Marky Jackson, and
Kara de la Marck.
This was a crazy year for everyone. Regardless of that, the org admins stepped up and took responsibility for students and mentors involved in the project, with a serious time commitment.
Not all work by the organizers is publicly visible (applications, project selection, resolving conflicts),
but this work is essential to the project’s success.
Thanks a lot to org admins and mentors who helped with the administrative tasks this year!

What’s about GSoC 2021?

Yes, we plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021.
The application period for organizations will start in a few months,
but we have already started preparing for the next GSoC session.
We are looking for mentors, org admins and project ideas.
Please contact us if you are interested!

Call for Mentors and Project Ideas

GSoC 2021 project ideas

HOWTO: Propose a project idea

Information for mentors : guidelines and expectations

We invite potential students to start exploring the project and the available project ideas.
Original ideas are always welcome in the project, and starting early is a great opportunity to
get introduced to the Jenkins community, collect more information about the problem areas,
and to create a good proposal.
&quot;Start early&quot; is the most popular recommendation from GSoC 2020 participants to future GSoC students,
and we encourage you to follow this advice!<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><a href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev/">Oleg Nenashev</a><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/gsoc">gsoc</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/gsoc2020">gsoc2020</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/jenkins">jenkins</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/community">community</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/events">events</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/mentor">mentor</a></li></ul></div></li><li class="post"><a class="body" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/2020/12/17/jira-upgrade-for-the-jenkins-project/"><div class="header"><div class="date"><div class="month">Dec</div><div class="day">17</div></div><h5 class="title">Jira upgrade for the Jenkins project</h5></div><p class="teaser">The Jenkins project has used Jira to track issues for many years.
Jenkins core, Jenkins modules, Jenkins infrastructure, and many Jenkins plugins manage their issue reports with our Jira server.

Jira helps the Jenkins project manage issues and tasks related to over 250 000 Jenkins installations.
It tracks bugs, enhancement requests, tasks, and security issues.
It is used regularly by users around the world.

We’re grateful for the long-standing contribution that Atlassian provides by donating the Jira license to the Jenkins project.
We’re grateful to the Oregon State University Open Source Lab for their donation of equipment and bandwidth to host the server.

Upgrade Timeline

We were running Jira 7.13 and had been managing that installation for a few years.
Atlassian announced that Jira 7.13 would end its support life on November 28, 2020.
We needed to upgrade from Jira 7.13 to a more recent version of Jira.
As part of our membership in the Continuous Delivery Foundation, a Linux Foundation initiative, we could use their project services team to manage our Jira server.
We decided to move from hosting our own Jira server to having the Jira experts at the Linux Foundation host it.

The upgrade timeline looked like this:

November 2019 - Infrastructure team begins discussions about the November 2020 end of support for Jira 7.13

August 2020 - First conversations with Linux Foundation to host Jira for the Jenkins project.  Draft of the upgrade plan assembled and shared with the community

September 2020 - Schedule for testing week and final transition week proposed.  Authentication options evaluated and selected

October 2020 - Test upgrade performed and tested

November 2020 - Final upgrade completed and verified

Confronting the Complications

Initial discussions between the Jenkins infrastructure team and the Linux Foundation identified complications related to authentication and SSL certificates.
We planned, negotiated, and tested our assumptions throughout the project.

Authentication

Jira servers at the Linux Foundation typically use Linux Foundation accounts for user access.
Unfortunately, the Jenkins LDAP database includes over 100,000 users and for many of them, Linux Foundation username doesn’t correspond to Jenkins account username.
It was not feasible to transition 100,000 user accounts from the Jenkins LDAP database to the Linux Foundation accounts system and still complete the Jira upgrade before the November 28, 2020 deadline.

The Linux Foundation Project Services team evaluated authentication alternatives and confirmed that they could use the Jenkins LDAP server.
Using the Jenkins LDAP server spared us from two transitions, LDAP and Jira, and kept the project timeline feasible.

SSL Certificates

Jira servers at the Linux Foundation use Let’s Encrypt to generate SSL certificates for HTTPS.
The Linux Foundation uses the DNS method to obtain SSL certificates.
Unfortunately, the Jenkins project uses the HTTP method to obtain SSL certificates.

Thankfully, Olivier Vernin of the Jenkins project and Anton Baranov of the Linux Foundation found a solution.
They created an ACME record in the Jenkins DNS server and pointed the issues.jenkins.io DNS record at the new Linux Foundation Jira server.

Building the Prototype

Anton Baranov created a prototype Jira server, restored an older Jenkins Jira backup, and upgraded it to Jira 8.13.
That first restore detected that we had not provided the Jira attachments or the Jira avatars.
That attachments and avatars added multiple gigabytes to the initial backup data and were vital to complete the update.

Testing the Upgrade

A group of volunteers including Jenkins users, security team members, and infrastructure team members tested the upgrade during the week of October 26, 2020.
The tests confirmed that authentication worked as expected and that the Jira prototype was functioning as expected.

We thank the test team, including:

Daniel Beck

Tim Jacomb

Olivier Vernin

Mark Waite

The tests included:

Creating and routing issues

Commenting on issues

Viewing dashboards with the expected content

LDAP settings

Email notification

The tests detected minor issues that Anton was able to correct in preparation for the final upgrade.
The testing team agreed that the tests were successful.

Deploying the Upgrade

Olivier Vernin announced the final upgrade by email to the Jenkins infra list with details of the changes happening during the upgrade.
Monday, November 9, 2020, the final backup of the existing Jira server was copied into the new Linux Foundation server.

The final upgrade encountered issues that we had not seen during the initial tests.
The &quot;bumps and bruises&quot; from the unexpected issues were resolved by Anton Baranov as he used a multi-step upgrade process.
The steps included:

Restore the earlier backup to Jira 7.13

Restore the most recent backup

Upgrade to Jira 8.13

Install avatars, attachments, and other images

Update DNS entries to point to the new Jenkins Jira server

Lessons from the Upgrade

Lessons were related to timing, estimation, and communication.

Scheduling the Upgrade

The test upgrade started the week of October 19, 2020.
It took several days longer than originally expected.
Thankfully, we had allowed an extra week between the test upgrade and the production upgrade.

The originally announced schedule for the final upgrade was intentionally placed in a week that would not include a long term support release.
That reduced the risk of disruption if the upgrade took longer than required or failed and we had to roll back.

Estimating the Work

Discussions with the Jenkins project Jira administrators and the Linux Foundation Jira experts provided very reasonable estimates of time to complete the work.
We intentionally allowed additional time between first test and final upgrade.
We needed that additional time and used it well as the testing week.

Communicating the Plan

The distributed nature of the Jenkins project makes communication challenging for major changes.
We communicated plans at various stages but still found occasions where the communication was insufficient.
In this case, the adage held true that it is, &quot;impossible to communicate too much&quot;.

Thanks for your patience during the upgrade and thanks to the Linux Foundation for administering the Jenkins Jira server.<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><a href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/markewaite/">Mark Waite</a><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/jenkins">jenkins</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/infrastructure">infrastructure</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/jira">jira</a></li></ul></div></li><li class="post"><a class="body" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/2020/12/16/call-for-mentors/"><div class="header"><div class="date"><div class="month">Dec</div><div class="day">16</div></div><h5 class="title">Google Summer of Code 2021 call for Project Ideas and Mentors</h5></div><p class="teaser">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
is a program where students are paid a stipend by Google to work on a free open source project.
Students work on the project for three months (June to August).
Prior to the coding phase, there is a month of community bonding, to welcome students to the Jenkins community and acquaint them with the projects processes for communication and collaboration.
Mentors are actively involved with students from March when students start to work on and submit their applications.
(see the timeline)

We are looking for project ideas and mentors to participate in GSoC 2021.
GSoC project ideas are coding projects that university or college students can accomplish in about three months.
The coding projects can be new features, plugins, test frameworks, infrastructure, etc.
Anyone can submit a project idea, but of course we like it even better if you offer to mentor your project idea.

We accept new project ideas at any time,
However, project ideas need to be finalised before February 19th, 2021 at 7pm UTC,
which is the deadline for the Jenkins organization to apply to the GSoC program.
Please send us your project ideas before the beginning of February so they can get a proper review by the GSoC committee and by the community.

How to submit a project idea

Create a pull-request with your idea in a.adoc file
in the project ideas.
It is not necessary to submit a Google Doc, but it will still work if you want to do that.
See the instructions on submitting ideas which include an.adoc template and some examples.

Current list of ideas

We currently have a list of project ideas for students to browse.
Note that this list is subject to change.

What does mentoring involve?

Potential mentors are invited to read the information for mentors.
Note that being a GSoC mentor does not require expert knowledge of Jenkins.
Mentors do not work alone. We make sure that every project has at least two mentors.
GSoC org admins will help to find technical advisers, so you can study together with your students.

Mentoring takes about 5 to 8 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).
Mentors provide guidance, coaching, and sometimes a bit of cheerleading.
They review student proposals, pull-requests and the students presentations
at the evaluation phase.
They fill in the Google provided evaluation report form at the end of coding periods.

What do you get in exchange?

In return of mentoring, a student works on your project full time for three months.
Think about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but never had the time…​

Mentoring is also an opportunity to improve your management and people skills, while giving back to the community.

There will be a Google Mentor Summit which takes place every year.
In 2020, the Mentor Summit was virtual, but in previous years the summit has taken place in person.

See this post
about the 2019 in person Mentor Summit.

GSoC is a fantastic program and the Jenkins project is happy to participate in GSoC again in 2021!

For any question, you can find the GSoC Org Admins,
mentors and participants on the GSoC SIG Gitter chat.<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><a href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/marckk/">Kara de la Marck</a><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/gsoc">gsoc</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/gsoc2021">gsoc2021</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/community">community</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/events">events</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/developer">developer</a></li></ul></div></li><li class="post"><a class="body" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/2020/12/11/devops-world-2020-jenkins-contributors-awarded-top-honors-at-devops-worlds-2020/"><div class="header"><div class="date"><div class="month">Dec</div><div class="day">11</div></div><h5 class="title">“Jenkins Contributors Awarded Top Honors at DevOps World 2020”</h5></div><p class="teaser">At DevOps World on September 24, 2020, through the sponsorship of CloudBees, three Jenkins contributors were recognized for their contributions to the Jenkins project.

We found that some submitted stories were far too big to be constrained by our format of &#x27;background/goal/solution/results.&#x27;

Some Jenkins users had a much more complex story to tell, whether it was about getting upper management to buy-in, keeping developers happy, or simply making sure pipelines weren’t just bottlenecks in disguise.

Here are a handful of Jenkins Case Studies we’ve published in the past few months, with many more on the way!

Case Study #1: D4Science

Amping up scientific research with CI/CD powered by Jenkins

To promote open science practices and support scientific communities while serving 11k registered users in 45 countries, D4Science introduced a new delivery pipeline that replaced their pre-existing build platform.

Of course, they had to build and release their software framework (gCube) in a way that would support multi-project releases at scale — from 200+ Git repositories within the same day! It had to be fast, automate all release activities, and it had to deliver incremental releases to address user requirements quickly. Most of all, the solution had to be cost-effective.

Using Jenkins, they created an innovative approach to software delivery: a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, scalable, easy to maintain, and upgradable at a minimal cost.

Discover how D4Science empowers e-Science and virtual research communities with software released via Jenkins. Read the Jenkins case study featuring D4Science here!

Case Study #2: Gainsight

Humanizing CSX with tech innovation and a robust DevSecOps platform

Gainsight’s customer service experience platform helps customer success teams at more than 100 leading IT and healthcare clients. How? By driving engagement for tens of thousands of their customers.

That’s why the engineering team at Gainsight approached the customer experience by building a smarter, faster DevSecOps platform using Jenkins. They stuck to an infrastructure-as-code approach while integrating various tools and programming languages all within the platform. And they secured processes with better visibility and air-tight quality control.

The result was a flexible DevSecOps infrastructure, 95% of which is scalable with code. And the cost of infrastructure costs was 40% less. That provides Gainsight with ease of collaboration, keener operational insight, and — because builds are 30% faster — the ability to stay a step ahead of the competition.

Read why Gainsight’s lead DevOps engineer, Prudviraj Pentakota, says &quot;Jenkins is the epicenter of DevSecOps in our organization.&quot; Get the full story here.

Case Study #3: Avoris Travel

Reinventing travel with an inventive technology platform

Part of Barceló Group, Ávoris Travel is behind prominent destination travel brands like LeSki, Le Musik, and a selection of author travels under its &quot;Viagens Com Assinatura&quot; signature travel concept. A proprietary database and a smart, dynamic booking engine are the tickets to offering differentiating and inventive travel opportunities.

Also unique to Avoris is a discreet machining technology that enables agents to enter specific criteria to search and find all types of trips and travel opportunities across the entire network.

&quot;Our infrastructure is very important because we have to be online to meet customer demand anywhere in the world,&quot; said Alejandro Alvarez Vazquez, Sysadmin, Avoris Travel. &quot;Our CI/CD platform is used by 200 people. The services that we build and deploy are used by thousands of potential clients and by our network of 675 own agencies located in Spain and Portugal.&quot;

Read the case study to learn how the flexibility of Jenkins plugins helped Avoris reduce build times by over 50% and became a go-to, scalable infrastructure supporting 675 agencies and over 2.8 million international consumers.

What’s your story?

We want to know what you’re building with Jenkins and would love to post your case study on our&quot;Jenkins Is The Way&quot; website, a global showcase of how developers and engineers build, deploy, and automate great stuff with Jenkins.

The best way to get started is to share your Jenkins User story with us. We’ll send you a free Jenkins Is The Way T-Shirt in return and publish your account for the entire Jenkins community to see. And if it’s selected for a Case Study, we’ll be in touch for a one-on-one interview!

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.
Kubernetes is compatible with the majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests, deploy builds in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.
One of the most popular CI/CD tools now is Jenkins thereby making Jenkins on Kubernetes a popular theme for Jenkins users.

During the Google Season Of Docs program, I worked with the Jenkins organization on the project - Document Jenkins on Kubernetes.
The original proposal for this project can be found here.

Project Goals

After my proposal was accepted by the Jenkins organization, my mentors and I agreed on the expectations for the Google Season of Docs project.
The goal of this project was to create a new Kubernetes Volume which would describe the concepts, techniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins thereby providing the following advantages:

Improve the user experience of Jenkins on Kubernetes users by giving them a one-stop-shop for information on Jenkins on Kubernetes.

Make it easy to track, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes

Reference the existing community documentation for Jenkins on K8s (plugins and tools/integrations).

How to guides, tutorials and explanations of concepts and techniques in Jenkins on Kubernetes.

Just-In-Time documentation which means that rather than documenting every feature comprehensively, we produce and release documentation in bits but continuously based on popular questions, feedback and area of interests gathered from the community and users.

Community Bonding: Planning the solution

Find below an outline of my activities during the community bonding phase:

Setting up communication channels: meetings, mailings, chats: My mentors and I agreed on the right time and channel for communication due to time difference.
We agreed to meet twice weekly, on Mondays and Thursdays at 7:00 PM GMT +1 and use Jenkins documentation gitter channel for other communications.

Contacting Stakeholders and onboarding contributors: The project was  announced on social media and different Jenkins channels.
I wrote a blog post to announce the project and created a project page on Jenkins.io.

Knowledge transfer: I and my mentors planned knowledge sharing sessions and fixed tentative dates based on the availability of the trainers.
My mentors also shared useful resources to help me prepare for the project.

Getting permissions: I and my mentors agreed I didn’t need any special permissions from the beginning, however, this topic was left open for discussion if the need arose later on in the project.

Pre-planning of the project: I refined my goals and set expectations with my mentor and also learned more about the community(Jenkins).
I also had to ensure that the proposed documentation structure I drafted was in line with the goals of the organization so my mentors vetted it and we finalized on the proposed sections that I was supposed to work on.

Documentation Development Phase

Knowledge Sharing Sessions

During the development phase, my mentors hosted two knowledge sharing sessions:

Katacoda and Helm by Marky Jackson

See the slides

Helm by Torsten Walter

See the slides

These sessions gave me an in-depth understanding of concepts and tools needed for the project.

Jenkins on Kubernetes Documentation Skeleton

At the application phase, I drafted a structure describing the proposed Jenkins on Kubernetes section.
My intention was to use it as a guide during the implementation phase of the project, but when the development phase kicked off, my mentors and I thought of a better approach to creating a new Jenkins on Kubernetes section which was to add the Jenkins on Kubernetes contents to existing related sections for easier navigation and better user experience.
An example of this approach would be creating the Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes section under the Installing Jenkins section rather than putting it under an entirely new section.
With this new approach, I was assigned a task to create a skeleton with all the proposed Jenkins on Kubernetes sections on Jenkins.io and mark these sections as
Work In Progress (WIP).
The Plan was to use this skeleton as a guide throughout the GSOD Project.
The Jenkins on Kubernetes skeleton PR can be found here.

Documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes

While working on this project, I had to do a lot of research and test all the documented steps locally before pushing the documentation out for review.
I also made sure to use updated terms and terminologies where necessary like Controller instead of Master and Agents instead of Slave.

During the documentation phase, I was able to work on documenting Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes with three sections Helm, Set of Yaml files and Jenkins Operator.
I also worked on creating a directory for Jenkins on kubernetes sample files in Jenkins.io repository, documenting Scaling Jenkins on Kubernetes and Jenkins on AWS which is still in progress.

Work Done

Pull Requests : All the pull requests I submitted to Jenkins.io documentation can be found here.
This spreadsheet contains links to the published documentation on Jenkins.io.
The spreadsheet also highlights the initial proposed tasks and the status of each of them.

If you would like to contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes documentation, you can check out pending tasks here and reach out in the Jenkins documentation gitter channel.

Challenges

Using a Windows computer was a bit of a challenge for me.
To run Jenkins.io locally, the project uses GNU/Make and Docker in order to generate the fully statically generated jenkins.io web site.
The key tool for converting source code into the site is the Awestruct static site generator, which is downloaded automatically as part of the build process.
To achieve this, I needed to have GNU/Make and Docker available on my machine.
Docker was not a problem, but to achieve the latter, I needed to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
WSL had two versions WSL1 and WSL2. Using WSL2 would have been much more convenient, but my version of windows wasn’t compatible with WSL2 as it required Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher for x64 systems.
With this obstacle, I had to stick to making WSL1 work but I still couldn’t get this to work, a series of issues came up which I was able to pass through with the help of my mentors until I got stuck at permission issues.
I raised the issue with my mentor and after looking through the issue with me and trying to solve it to no avail, he suggested setting up an Ubuntu VM in Hyper-V.
This article helped me achieve this and that solved my problem.

What did I learn?

I learned a lot more about the Jenkins project, Kubernetes, helm package manager, Jenkins Operator and much more.
This project also gave me the opportunity to work with cloud providers like AWS which was totally new to me and also learn from field experts through knowledge sharing sessions and weekly meetings with my mentors and org admin.
My technical writing skill and communication skill have definitely become better and I owe it to this project.

Overall, contributing to the Jenkins.io project is an amazing experience for me.
I have been using Jenkins, and the fact that I was able to contribute to the organization and collaborate with the community is an honor.<span class="more"></span></p></a><div class="attrs"><a href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/authors/zaycodes/">Zainab Abubakar</a><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/kubernetes">kubernetes</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/helm">helm</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/documentation">documentation</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/gsod">gsod</a></li><li><a class="tag-link" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/node/tags/jenkins/gsod2020">gsod2020</a></li></ul></div></li><li class="post"><a class="body" href="/gatsby-jenkins-io/blog/2020/12/03/election-results/"><div class="header"><div class="date"><div class="month">Dec</div><div class="day"> 3</div></div><h5 class="title">2020 Jenkins Board and Officer Elections Results</h5></div><p class="teaser">The Jenkins community has recently completed the 2020 elections.

It would be an honor to have them on the Jenkins board.
Regardless of the election results, we appreciate their participation and the time they invested in these elections.

This year we were electing 2 governance board members.
We were using the Condorcet Internet Voting Service that allows voters to rank their choices rather than just picking their one favorite choice.
You can find full voting results here :

Mark Waite  (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)

Marky Jackson loses to Mark Waite by 48–12

Gavin Mogan loses to Mark Waite by 51–10, loses to Marky Jackson by 31–20

Ewelina Wilkosz  loses to Mark Waite by 48–14, loses to Gavin Mogan by 29–28

Justin Harringa  loses to Mark Waite by 51–11, loses to Ewelina Wilkosz by 35–16

Steven Terrana  loses to Mark Waite by 47–16, loses to Justin Harringa by 20–19

Zhao Xiaojie (Rick)  loses to Mark Waite by 57–5, loses to Steven Terrana by 25–24

Frederic Gurr  loses to Mark Waite by 52–10, loses to Zhao Xiaojie (Rick) by 25–24

Andrey Falko  loses to Mark Waite by 56–6, loses to Frederic Gurr by 26–13

Although Mark Waite came first in the voting results,
being on the board would violate the Corporate Involvement clause which states that
&quot;the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%&quot;.
Mark will continue to be Documentation officer.
Regardless of his official role, Mark has been leading many initiatives and helping a lot with various aspects of the community governance.

Congratulations to Marky and Gavin, and thanks to all candidates!
All new board members are elected for a 2-year term unless they decide to step down earlier.
The estimated end of the term for them is December 02, 2022.
We would also like to thank Alex Earl and R. Tyler Croy who step down from the Jenkins Governance Board this year.
Thanks to them for all contributions and for continued community leadership.

Statement from Marky Jackson:

It is a tremendous honor to be elected to this roles. I am so humbled.
Being part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.
My goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.
I look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.

— Marky Jackson, Jenkins Governance Board Member and Events Officer

Statement from Gavin Mogan:

Gavin here. I’m still in shock that I got voted in for the Jenkins board.
It felt like yesterday I just got started helping people randomly on IRC. This is truly exciting.
I plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.
This is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.
My specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.

— Gavin Mogan, Jenkins Governance Board Member

Officer election details

All 5 officer positions were up for election this year.
These roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2021.
After the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,
4 officer positions were uncontested:

Olivier Vernin - Infrastructure officer.

Marky Jackson - Events officer.
Marky inherits this role from Alyssa Tong
who decided to step down from the officer role and to focus on the Jenkins community marketing,
including Jenkins Is The Way and many other initiatives started by Alyssa.

Mark Waite - Documentation officer.

Daniel Beck - Security officer.

Thanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!
Officers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.
It requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.

Release Officer election results

Tim Jacomb won the biggest support as a Release officer ( voting results).
Tim will replace in this role Oliver Gondža
who has been leading the Release Team and the release processes since 2016 when the role was officially introduced.

Tim Jacomb (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)

Baptiste Mathus  loses to Tim Jacomb by 40–23

Victor Martinez  loses to Tim Jacomb by 38–25, loses to Baptiste Mathus by 32–31

Here is a statement from Tim Jacomb:

I’m excited for the year ahead, let’s see where we can take the Jenkins release area in the future.
As a Release Officer I would like to increase automation, ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team,
and ensure that responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.

— Tim Jacomb, Jenkins Release Officer

Thanks to Alyssa Tong and Oliver Gondža for their long-time service as Jenkins officers!
We are looking to continue working with them in the Jenkins community.
And congratulations to Tim Jacomb and Marky Jackson for joining the team!

Statistics

This year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.
It is significantly lower than in the 2019 elections when we had almost 350 voters.
It can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.
This year we decided to not use the previous voter registration system,
and we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.
This is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.

What’s next for the board?

The last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.
With help of many contributors and with the renewed board,
we have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,
for example hosting contributor summits,
publishing the public roadmap,
Code of Conduct update,
terminology changes,
and graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.
There is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.

In short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.
The board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes
(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.

There are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:
long-anticipated features and architecture changes,
changing the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process,
creating better communication channels with Jenkins users,
and onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.
Such initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.
The ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.
If you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,
it is definitely a great time to contribute!

Feedback

Jenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.
We will appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process so that we can improve the process.
We have started a Retrospective document for these elections.
Everyone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.
There will be also a public retrospective review at the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meeting on Dec 17.

If you have any private feedback you would like to share,
please send an email to the Jenkins Board.
If you would like to raise any issues about the election process,
please contact one of the elected Governance Board members.
