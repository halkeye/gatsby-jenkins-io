All in all we counted 721 responses --- thanks everyone for voicing their thoughts! +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nNaturally, it took a while to tally that many responses, but thanks to https://twitter.com/ProductPrincipl[Lisa], we https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb[now have the result] in time for the holiday. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAs you can see in https://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/total-jenkins.svg[our installation tracking], Jenkins installation base has grown 66% since the last year, so I was naturally very curious if this has affected the area of focus for us the developers. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nHowever, when https://pages.cloudbees.com/Jenkins_Survey_2011_JenkinsSurveyDownloadPage.html[compared to the result from the last year], the first thing I notice is the consistency in many metrics. For example, about 83% of people considers Jenkins mission critical this year, and the last year it was 82%. The distribution between beginner/intermediate/expert users are also quite similar. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nBut this year, we asked a number of questions that we didn’t ask the last year. One of them is the version control systems that people use. Here, we get 61% Subversion, 50% Git, and everything else is within 10%. So clearly we need to start shipping Git plugin pre-bundled! +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAnother interesting question that we asked is the languages people use. There’s a surprising number of C/C++ projects on Jenkins (and good number of Ruby, PHP, Python, and C#!), which made me feel that we need to hear more from those users about the kind of tool integrations we need to be providing. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nOne more gem is that whopping 11% of the respondents said they have written and contributed plugins to the community (that’s 82 people!), and another 9% of the respondents said they wrote one but just not sharing it because it doesn’t make sense (7%), or they couldn’t (2%). That’s about 1 in every 5 respondents writing some plugins, which is amazing, if you ask me. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAnother big part of the survey was asking respondents what are important in Jenkins --- is it documentation, quality, UI, etc? But I guess I shouldn’t spoil your fun of actually https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb[looking at the result], so please go take a look yourself! Also, if you want to tally the numbers yourself, here’s the anonymized raw data. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nI’ll hopefully do a separate post on the efforts we are taking to answer those points raised in the survey in coming days. +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"1173321c-3ce3-53dc-b412-a8ab044439ff","title":"2012 Jenkins Survey results are in","date":"2013-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2013/01/09/2012-jenkins-survey-results-are-in/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2013/01/26/report-jenkins-meet-up-seoul/","previous":"/blog/2012/12/25/jenkins-meet-up/","id":"1173321c-3ce3-53dc-b412-a8ab044439ff"}},
