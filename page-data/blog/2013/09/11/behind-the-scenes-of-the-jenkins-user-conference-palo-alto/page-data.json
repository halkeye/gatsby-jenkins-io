If you have a cool design in mind please send it to `+events@lists.jenkins-ci.org+`. You may just see the Jenkins community wearing your design at next year’s conference. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAlso check out the great Jenkins collectible that https://www.cloudbees.com[CloudBees], the Platinum sponsor, is giving out at the CloudBees table (I heard he looks even better in person). Quantity is limited so be sure to pick one up at the CloudBees table. You might have to sing, dance, bark or just complete a survey in exchange for the Jenkins bobble head. Most importantly, don’t forget to have Kohsuke sign it to make it official. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/12508267@N00/9725573715/\">+ <span class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2878/9725573715_fa056b6652_n.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></span> +</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">+\n+</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nJUC isn’t complete without some good BEvERages.
