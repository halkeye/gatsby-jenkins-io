For 2014, the challenge of finding a venue for a capacity of 500+ attendees at a low cost will prove even more daunting. We would love to hear your suggestions for low cost venues (in the Bay Area) so that we may continue to keep entry cost low while providing convenience and the highest level of Jenkins education to attendees.
