I'm personally looking forward to a number of talks from serious large-scale users, and https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-israel.cb[JUC Israel] was of any indication, it'd be a great opportunity to get feedback from people. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nThis year, we are moving the event to a weekday (Oct 23rd) to see if it helps or hurts the attendance. Similarly, the event is now in Palo Alto, as opposed to San Francisco. The site also happens to be a former Sun Microsystems headquarter, a place of some nostalgic value to me. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nI am also very happy to see a number of active community members https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto.cb[signing up their employers to sponsor the event].
