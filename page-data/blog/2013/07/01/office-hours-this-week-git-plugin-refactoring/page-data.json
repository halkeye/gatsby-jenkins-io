Combine that with the fact that there are so many different ways to use Git, it was inevitable that Git plugin became quite a capable but complex plugin over time. It has more than a dozen options and switches, and it was becoming harder to use and harder to maintain.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As early as 2010, some of us have already been saying that we should refactor this plugin, but none of us have managed. The good news is, I finally started tackling this problem last month while I was in London, and I&#8217;ve made a steadily progress since then and I&#8217;m ready for a wider review.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So we&#8217;ll spend this Wednesday going over the changes. I&#8217;ll show you how the new version looks, what changes are made internally, and what it&#8217;ll enable us in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If the Git plugin is important to you, and you want to see what&#8217;s cooking, please join us in <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours\">the office hours</a> on Google Hangout.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Looking forward to seeing you!</p>\n</div>","id":"f1db07c0-565b-5067-b0a9-2002cb14ebb5","title":"Office hours this week: Git plugin refactoring","date":"2013-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2013/07/01/office-hours-this-week-git-plugin-refactoring/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2013/07/11/jenkins-user-conference-israel-summary/","previous":"/blog/2013/06/21/reducing-the-of-threads-in-jenkins-ssh-slaves/","id":"f1db07c0-565b-5067-b0a9-2002cb14ebb5"}},
