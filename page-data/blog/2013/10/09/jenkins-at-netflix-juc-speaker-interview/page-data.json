It&#8217;s a great opportunity to meet people who are as passionate about build, test and deployment automation as we are - although as Kohsuke said last year, having all those folks in one place could be dangerous if there&#8217;s an earthquake !</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>CloudBees and the JUC Organizing Committee have put another great program together this year. We&#8217;ll be doing two talks. Justin Ryan and Curt Patrick will present \"Configuration as Code: Adoption of the Job DSL Plugin at Netflix\", describing how we&#8217;re shifting our users from manual job configuration via the UI, to defining their jobs as Groovy code using the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin\">Job DSL plugin</a>. Justin and Curt will describe how Netflix development teams can now create and maintain complex sets of jobs for their projects with the bare minimum of coding.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In my lightning talk \"Managing Jenkins with Jenkins\", I&#8217;ll go over how we use Jenkins' system Groovy scripts to maintain and monitor our Jenkins controllers at a scale that couldn&#8217;t be achieved with manual processes, and without the overhead of writing custom plugins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As usual, there will be a whole crew of Netflix engineers at JUC this year. If you&#8217;re interested in working on build and deployment at Netflix scale, find one of us (we&#8217;ll all be wearing Netflix gear) to learn more - we&#8217;re hiring !</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/event/6367028955\">Register for JUC - October 23 in Palo Alto</a>.
