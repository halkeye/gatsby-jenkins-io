Besides snapping the photo below, I also managed to get yelled out by an old woman wearing a red \"security\" jacket; suffice to say my JavaOne experience is already everything I expected!<center>image:https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/4997929716_1675745efe.jpg<span class=\"Oracle taking over Howard St\"></center></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Unlike last year&#8217;s Oracle OpenWorld, which also shut down this segment of Howard St in San Francisco and took over the adjacent Yerba Buena Gardens, this event will be crammed together with JavaOne. <span class=\"image\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/4998934102/\"><img src=\"https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/4998934102_d7c71e575e_m.jpg\" alt=\"20100917_003.jpg\" width=\"240\"></a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At this point I&#8217;m not sure what I can expect as far as the JavaOne portion of the event goes, we do have <strong>two</strong> Hudson related events scheduled:\n<br></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Getting More Out of Your Hudson</strong> - Monday at 10:00 a.m. - Hosted by our very own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa\">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a>, the session will be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Embarcadero.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Getting More from Your CI Server: Taking Hudson to the Next Level</strong> - Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. - Hosted by the (in)famous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wakeleo\">John Smart</a> the session will also be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Cyril Magnin 1.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><br></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/4998330661/\"><img src=\"https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/4998330661_91514f797a_m.jpg\" alt=\"20100917_004.jpg\" width=\"240\"></a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Unfortunately those were the only specifically-Hudson related tracks I could find, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/abayer\">Andrew Bayer</a> has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/abayer/status/24507253586\">mentioned before</a>, finding a proper schedule is near impossible.
