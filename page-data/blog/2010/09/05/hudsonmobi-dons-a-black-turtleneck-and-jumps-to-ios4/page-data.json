Now the leading mobile app for Hudson users has regained my trust with their <a href=\"https://hudsonmobi.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/hudsonmobi-for-ios-4-is-here/\">lastest release for iOS 4</a>, the latest incarnation of Apple&#8217;s mobile operating systems for iPhones and iPod Touches.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Since I fall into the category of subhumans who for one reason or another choose not to own an iPhone, I can&#8217;t verify the awesomeness of this new HudsonMobi release. If it is anything like the 2.0 release for Android you can expect enhancements such as:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tighter integration with iOS 4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Embedded artifact viewer!</strong> For archived build artifacts that are text-based, you can view them directly on your handset.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access to the build history and changes for a job.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quick and easy access to a job&#8217;s last build</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you own a device with iOS <strong>3.0 or higher</strong> you should be able to download HudsonMobi 2.0 from the appstore, if you give it a whirl, please leave a comment to let me know how awesome it is :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><br>\n---</p>\n</div>","id":"a88c7ef1-9616-56e2-af1b-362d3846cc0e","title":"HudsonMobi dons a black turtleneck and jumps to iOS4","date":"2010-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2010/09/05/hudsonmobi-dons-a-black-turtleneck-and-jumps-to-ios4/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2010/09/09/lets-talk-about-hudson-at-javaone/","previous":"/blog/2010/09/04/hudson-events-calendar/","id":"a88c7ef1-9616-56e2-af1b-362d3846cc0e"}},
