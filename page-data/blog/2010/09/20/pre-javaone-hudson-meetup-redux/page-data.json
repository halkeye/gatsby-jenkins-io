While Digg has been\nthe source of some controversy and press due to their recent redesign and corporate\nshake-ups, as far as the Hudson community goes they&#8217;ve been largely responsible for\na <a href=\"https://about.digg.com/blog/continuous-deployment-code-review-and-pre-tested-commits-digg4\">great case study on continuous deployment</a> using Hudson and <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/gerrit\">Gerrit</a>.<center>image:https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5005123971_403f24733d.jpg<span class=\"Thanks to @digg for hosting the #HudsonCI meetup\"></center></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Attendees included all of InfraDNA (Kohsuke and Kedar), some folks from CloudBees, a\nnumber of local users/developers like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LewisHam\">LewisHam</a> and myself, and\nto top off the list a couple Oracle employees including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wjprakash\">Winston Prakash</a> who is now hacking on Hudson inside of Oracle.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As folks started arriving there was a lot of discussion around \"Hudson at Scale\", specifically\nregarding Hudson \"in the cloud\". We also got to hear about one of the most interesting Hudson\nuse-cases I&#8217;ve ever seen by <a href=\"https://edwardmgoldberg.com\">Edward M. Goldberg</a> who I&#8217;ll post an\ninterview with shortly, imagine using Hudson with <strong>thousands</strong> of machines, it&#8217;s that interesting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Through the afternoon there were a number of great discussions concerning Hudson stability,\nengaging more of the community and nitty-gritty details regarding Hudson&#8217;s internals such\nas the plugin API.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I&#8217;ve posted <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/hudsonlabs/sets/72157624992088468/\">photos from the event</a> on\nFlickr for posterity in case you&#8217;re interested.
