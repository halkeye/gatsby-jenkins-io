I use Hudson to build and test a number of pure Python modules and C extensions across numerous Python versions (covering 2.4 - 3.1). For most beginners, or those simply looking to get started with Python on Hudson, starting with my job configurations is too much at once, so instead I wanted to start at the \"beginning\" so to speak.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The trouble with getting people started with Hudson, given how simple and visual it is to use, is that articles with sample configurations are not particularly useful; a screencast however is a good medium for visually walking somebody through Hudson. The screencast below (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d-P4j5n_No\">also on YouTube</a>) is the <em>first</em> in a series of screencasts I&#8217;ll be doing, not only for Python on Hudson, but for Hudson overall. It is just over four minutes long, and covers setting up a simple continuous integration job for the <a href=\"https://eventlet.net\">Eventlet</a> library (which is hosted <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/which_linden/eventlet/\">on Bitbucket</a>)<center><object width=\"480\" height=\"295\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d-P4j5n_No\"></param>&lt;/param&gt;<param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param>&lt;/param&gt;<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param>&lt;/param&gt;<embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d-P4j5n_No\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"295\"></embed>&lt;/embed&gt;</object></center></p>\n</div>\n<hr>","id":"5821dff5-0138-58b1-adcc-2a38da03f591","title":"Screencast: Python on Hudson (Part 1)","date":"2010-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2010/03/31/screencast-python-on-hudson-part-1/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2010/04/01/announcing-the-hudson-2-0-roadmap/","previous":"/blog/2010/03/31/hudson-1-353-released/","id":"5821dff5-0138-58b1-adcc-2a38da03f591"}},
