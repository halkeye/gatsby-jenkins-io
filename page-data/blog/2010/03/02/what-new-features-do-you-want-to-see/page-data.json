This gives those of us in the Hudson development community a good sense of what&#8217;s really important to our users, which in turn helps us decide where to focus our efforts. If you&#8217;re interested, you can see <a href=\"https://issues.hudson-ci.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=10045\">the top voted issues</a> over at <a href=\"https://issues.hudson-ci.org\">our JIRA server.</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A good number of those issues have been high on the list for a while - I&#8217;m actually in the early stages of work on a plugin to answer <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-682\">HUDSON-682</a>, the current #1 most voted-for issue, two and a half years after it was opened. But I&#8217;m sure there are some equally useful features Hudson users would like to see added which aren&#8217;t on that list. So I&#8217;m asking you, dear readers: what are you looking for in Hudson that isn&#8217;t already there? Take a look around the existing issues - you may find a request that fits what you want lurking just out of the top 10, needing only your vote to push it into the spotlight. If no one&#8217;s yet created an issue requesting your desired feature, well, create one.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Or, better still, write a plugin or contribute a patch yourself!</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong>  If you&#8217;re interested in writing a plugin, you can check out <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io\">Hudson&#8217;s wiki</a> and/or <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial\">this guide</a> on the subject.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Andrew Bayer (<code>abayer</code>) has been a contributor to Hudson since early 2009, contributing to the ClearCase plugin, Hudson&#8217;s core and a small number of other plugins.
