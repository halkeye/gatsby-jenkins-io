We&#8217;re currently building <a href=\"https://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/hudson_main_trunk/\">Hudson proper</a>, the <a href=\"https://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/hudson_rc_branch/\">Hudson core RC branch</a>, individual builds for <a href=\"https://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Plugins/\">the various Hudson plugins</a> and <a href=\"https://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/gerrit_master/\">Gerrit</a>, as well as various <a href=\"https://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Libraries/\">libraries</a> and <a href=\"https://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Infrastructure/\">infrastructure jobs</a> Hudson depends on.<br>\n<br>\nWe&#8217;re currently running all those builds on a dedicated Linux agent, generously provided to the Hudson project by <a href=\"https://digg.com\">Digg</a>, my employer. This has been great - except for the day when I&#8217;d just added all the individual plugin jobs for the first time, we haven&#8217;t had real problems with capacity. But we are limited in the environments we can run our tests on as a result of only having a Linux agent. We&#8217;re currently playing with a temporary Windows agent, but we&#8217;d really like to have at least one more permanent Windows agent, and a Mac agent as well, so that we can run Hudson&#8217;s core integration tests on those platforms as well. Since this is Hudson we&#8217;re talking about, we don&#8217;t need the agent to be in any given physical location - we just need it to be running the agent process and talking to our server. If you&#8217;re interested in helping us out with this, please contact me at andrew dot bayer at gmail dot com.
