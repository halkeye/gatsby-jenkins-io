I say that he is leaving Sun, instead of leaving Oracle as Kohsuke worked at Sun for nine years and Oracle only a few months. In those nine years at Sun, Kohsuke has worked on some great products, the most notable of them being Hudson.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Per Kohsuke&#8217;s post:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Where am I heading next? I&#8217;m actually starting my own company to take Hudson to the next stage.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>What this means for Hudson still isn&#8217;t certain yet, fortunately it means that Hudson will continue to have at least one full-time developer. It remains to be seen where KohsukeCorp (the name has not yet been disclosed) will focus within the Hudson code-base. For the greater user-base of Hudson, this means that the schedule for releases may slow down during this transitional period, there are some logistics to work out with Oracle regarding some of the hardware Hudson has traditionally used to host <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/product/atlassian\">JIRA</a>, this blog, and a number of other machines helping support the Hudson project in one fashion or another.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The next couple of months will be interesting for the Hudson community; as per usual you&#8217;ll be able to get the latest updates from this blog or the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hudsonci\">@hudsonci</a> twitter account. I&#8217;ll let Kohsuke finish this post off:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>And finally, big thank you to everyone in the Hudson community, and in a broader java.net community. I wouldn&#8217;t be here without you guys, and I feel very proud that I&#8217;m a part of it.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr>","id":"63a1281e-0de7-5b27-96be-2c1254946977","title":"Kohsuke leaves Sun","date":"2010-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2010/04/07/kohsuke-leaves-sun/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
