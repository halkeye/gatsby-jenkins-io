One of the positive changes that came out shortly after the meet up was the support for \"Concurrent Builds\", allowing a job to be executed concurrently on different agents, a precursor to pre-tested commit support. Fervor for the pre-tested commit feature lowered as time went on, the feature being too dependent on the SCM itself was generally accepted as the reasoning behind the feature languishing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Chances are the feature is in fact too large for Hudson to support alone. It requires Hudson, the SCM and likely a third tool to work in concert together to perform such a feat.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>With Git, and the phenomenal code review tool <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/\">Gerrit</a>, and the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Plugin\">Gerrit plugin</a> by intrepid plugin developer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jyrkiputtonen\">Jyrki Puttonen</a>, pre-tested commits with Hudson, Git and Gerrit <em>are</em> possible.\nFor Git users more familiar with the distributed Git workflows, working with Gerrit should seem familiar. Gerrit has <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/\">JGit</a>, a Java implementation of Git embedded within it, along with an <code>sshd</code> stack, meaning Gerrit can masquerade as a \"regular\" Git remote repository. Developers can push and pull to the repository just as they can with any other Git repository (provided they have permissions of course). I won&#8217;t delve too much into using Gerrit specifically here, but the pre-tested workflow with Gerrit and Hudson would look something like this:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Dev creates a topic branch to work on a change</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Code is written (and hopefully tested) and committed locally</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dev pushes commit(s) to Gerrit</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hudson job (set to Poll SCM) picks up the patch, runs the job and marks it as \"+1 Verified\" or \"-1 Fails\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the job fails or is unstable, the change should be reworked or corrected (typically with <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html\">git-rebase(1)</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If Hudson says the change is good to go, it can be cherry-picked or pulled directly from Gerrit.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For example:<center>image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/gerrit_patch.png</center></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To learn more about Gerrit, check out the <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/\">project page on Google Code</a>; information on the Gerrit plugin can be <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Plugin\">found on the wiki</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>","id":"2e9993c3-3c9d-5d86-9f68-2a23c7450ae0","title":"Pre-tested commits with Git","date":"2010-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2010/04/12/pre-tested-commits-with-git/","authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
