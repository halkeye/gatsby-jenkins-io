I did a short presentation about the current state of the Hudson project and where we are focusing efforts on. Then we had a very energetic Q&amp;A sessions that lasted like 3 hours. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nimage:https://hudson-labs.org/sites/default/files/images/DSC00105.preview.JPG[image,width=400] +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">+\n+</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nPeople from Tikal told me that they deploy and manage a lot of Hudson instances, so their feedbacks in the workflow/choreography/orchestration related features were very useful. And as usual, people have some positively fascinating crazy use cases — One of the participants was from a semiconductor company that builds GPU, and he said he tests their graphics cards with Hudson, which involves multiple reboots of a computer, installing software, and making sure the card doesn't produce unwanted visual artifacts! +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAfter the discussion, we went out for a nice dinner in a restraunt inside one of the old buildings (one of the many things Jerusalem is good at!), and by the time I got back to the hotel it was 11pm. You can see https://www.tikalk.com/alm/hudson-israeli-users-group-meetup[Ittay's take on this meetup here]. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nimage:https://hudson-labs.org/sites/default/files/images/IMG_0199.JPG[image,height=400] +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">+\n+</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nOne of my concerns before starting this world-wide spontaneous Hudson users meetups was if enough people show up, but I'm starting to feel comfortable now that I've done several. Hudson appears to be entrenched everywhere, and people are interested in finding out their neighbors who are using them. So stay tuned for future Hudson meetups around the world — it might be in your city!</pre>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"d6bfdd2f-2091-5e76-b392-af86d9ff1a5e","title":"Hudson User Meet-up in Jerusalem","date":"2010-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2010/10/21/hudson-user-meet-up-in-jerusalem/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/kohsuke.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke/","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"d6bfdd2f-2091-5e76-b392-af86d9ff1a5e"}},
