The Hudson community in general has\nalways been incredibly supportive and friendly, but the outpouring of support from\nfriends and users who&#8217;ve not previously spoken up has been awe inspiring.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>That said, let&#8217;s get down to business. As <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/content/whos-driving-thing\">I covered\nyesterday</a> there is some\nbubbling frustration within the developer community regarding some project\ninfrastructure decisions and Oracle&#8217;s reactions to them. If you can&#8217;t spare the\ntime to read that novel of a blog post, the extremely shortened version is: devs want to\nmove codebase to GitHub, Oracle disagrees and claims to have final say (hijinks\nensue).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>While there is still a lot unresolved, several of the core contributors are\ndebating and weighing our options for moving forward in a way that best\nsuits Hudson both as a project and community. In the next couple days, Kohsuke\nor Andrew will be proposing a course of action for the community after some of\nthe options have been fully vetted. Please bear in mind that Hudson is a <strong>very</strong> big project with some fairly unique needs. We have <em>hundreds</em> of contributors committing either to core or the plugins, we release core once a week with plugin releases occurring to the tune of 20-40 updates a week. We&#8217;ve been pinging folks who work with various foundations and major open source projects to make sure we&#8217;re covering all our bases to make sure distractions like this don&#8217;t come up again for the foreseeable future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Due to issues with MySQL, Java, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, there is clearly a lot of anti-Oracle emotion out there right now, but I want\nto make sure that it&#8217;s clear that this <em>is not</em> about \"Us versus Oracle.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Our goal isn&#8217;t to \"stick it to the man,\" that doesn&#8217;t help make Hudson any better.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Our goal is to foster the kind of community that we all want to\nparticipate in, and to build and improve the best continuous integration\nserver available.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Stay tuned :)\n---</p>\n</div>","id":"1bf50073-e7ad-5e25-97a0-1aba40f622c8","title":"A brief update","date":"2010-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2010/12/01/a-brief-update/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2010/12/05/weekend-update-with-andrew-bayer/","previous":"/blog/2010/11/30/whos-driving-this-thing/","id":"1bf50073-e7ad-5e25-97a0-1aba40f622c8"}},
