The Hudson community in general has\nalways been incredibly supportive and friendly, but the outpouring of support from\nfriends and users who&#8217;ve not previously spoken up has been awe inspiring.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>That said, let&#8217;s get down to business. As <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/content/whos-driving-thing\">I covered\nyesterday</a> there is some\nbubbling frustration within the developer community regarding some project\ninfrastructure decisions and Oracle&#8217;s reactions to them. If you can&#8217;t spare the\ntime to read that novel of a blog post, the extremely shortened version is: devs want to\nmove codebase to GitHub, Oracle disagrees and claims to have final say (hijinks\nensue).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>While there is still a lot unresolved, several of the core contributors are\ndebating and weighing our options for moving forward in a way that best\nsuits Hudson both as a project and community. In the next couple days, Kohsuke\nor Andrew will be proposing a course of action for the community after some of\nthe options have been fully vetted. Please bear in mind that Hudson is a <strong>very</strong> big project with some fairly unique needs. We have <em>hundreds</em> of contributors committing either to core or the plugins, we release core once a week with plugin releases occurring to the tune of 20-40 updates a week. We&#8217;ve been pinging folks who work with various foundations and major open source projects to make sure we&#8217;re covering all our bases to make sure distractions like this don&#8217;t come up again for the foreseeable future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Due to issues with MySQL, Java, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, there is clearly a lot of anti-Oracle emotion out there right now, but I want\nto make sure that it&#8217;s clear that this <em>is not</em> about \"Us versus Oracle.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Our goal isn&#8217;t to \"stick it to the man,\" that doesn&#8217;t help make Hudson any better.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Our goal is to foster the kind of community that we all want to\nparticipate in, and to build and improve the best continuous integration\nserver available.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Stay tuned :)\n---</p>\n</div>","id":"1bf50073-e7ad-5e25-97a0-1aba40f622c8","title":"A brief update","date":"2010-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2010/12/01/a-brief-update/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
