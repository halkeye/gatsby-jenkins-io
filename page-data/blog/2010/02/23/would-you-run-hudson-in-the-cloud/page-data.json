About 10 months ago Kohsuke <a href=\"https://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/05/18/hudson-ec2-plugin\">announced the Hudson EC2 plugin</a> which has seen slow, but steady development since then, including support for the <a href=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/private\">Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud</a> which was added to the plugin in a release last Monday.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As The Build Doctor and his readers point out, continuous integration is a difficult task to offload into the cloud because of the immense hardware demands constant building and testing presents. That said, Hudson <em>does</em> very effectively manage spinning agents up and down on demand if you&#8217;ve configured it as such. Implication being: running Hudson in the cloud may be more efficient to meet peak demands without needing to run a large farm of machines.<span class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_in_the_cloud.png\" alt=\"hudson in the cloud\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in trying out the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Amazon+EC2+Plugin\">EC2 plugin</a>, check out <a href=\"https://www.sonatype.com/\">Sonatype&#8217;s</a> post on <a href=\"https://www.sonatype.com/people/2009/06/nexus-open-source-and-hudson-on-ec2/\">Nexus Open Source and Hudson on EC2</a> might be a good start.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Would you run Hudson in the cloud?</p>\n</div>","id":"943afd45-3e98-53a3-9907-bdd50716654f","title":"Would you run Hudson in the cloud?","date":"2010-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2010/02/23/would-you-run-hudson-in-the-cloud/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
