This is the first JUCC in Beijing and we are overwhelmed by the interest and love for Jenkins. The conference had sessions in DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Jenkins X, Pipeline, and Container. The GreatOps community, event host, invited John Willis, a thought leader of DevOps to deliver the keynote speech. John’s topic was \"DevOps: Almost 10 years - What A  Strange Long Trip It’s Been.\" It was very insightful to learn of the history of DevOps and John’s point of view on the practice.\n\nLily Lin from Micro Focus presented, \"How to practice CI/CD for large-scale micro service based on Jenkins Pipeline.\"\n\nJames Rawlings, one of the core Jenkins X contributors traveled from the United Kingdom to present, \"Jenkins X for the future, Easy CI/CD for Kubernetes.\"\n\nAfter James’ presentation, there were many questions about Jenkins X, Jenkins users in China are very interested in Jenkins X. We all posed Jenkins \"X\" gesture.\n\nWe also invite Shuwei Hao from Alibaba, Michael Hüttermann who is the author of DevOps for Developers, Xiang Lu from CPI.\n\nMr Huaqiang Li and Xiaojie Zhao ran a workshop for help attendees master Jenkins Pipeline and Jenkins X in the cloud environment.\n\nHere are additional pictures from our event\n\nSpecial THANKS to BC who is the co-organizer of JUCC to host the main track and Alyssa and Maxwell for your help with our event.\n\nNext up, Jenkins User Conference China Shenzhen in November.\nLet’s Jenkins X and DevOps!","title":"Jenkins User Conference China Beijing Recap","tags":["event","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Forest runs\nthe <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/\">Shanghai Jenkins Area Meetup</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bagevent.com/event/jenkins-user-conference\">Jenkins User Conference China</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"fjing","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Forest Jing","slug":"blog/author/fjing","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"fjing","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
