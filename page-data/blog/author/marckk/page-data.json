We believe that being part of the CDF\nGSoC org will create an environment for students with even more mentoring channels, potential cross-fertilization of ideas,\nand an even greater community of DevOps practitioners to join!\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\nGSoC is officially announced, and please expect more students to contact projects in our\nGitter channels and mailing lists.\nMany communications will also happen in SIG and sub-project channels.\nAlso, please join the gsoc channel on the /\">CDF Slack.\nWe will be working hard in order to help students to find interesting projects, to explore the area,\nand to prepare their project proposals before the deadline on April 13th.\nThen we will process the applications, select projects and assign mentor teams.\n\nAll information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its sub-project page.\n\nI am a student. How do I apply?\n\nSee the Information for students page for full application guidelines.\n\nWe encourage interested students to reach out to the Jenkins community early and to start exploring project ideas.\nAll project ideas have chats and mailing lists referenced on their pages.\nWe will be also organizing office hours for students,\nand you can use these meetings to meet org admins and mentors and to ask questions.\nAlso, join our Gitter channel and the\nmailing list\nto receive information about such incoming events in the project.\n\nThe application period starts on March 29th, but you can prepare now!\nUse the time before the application period to discuss and improve your project proposals.\nWe also recommend that you become familiar with Jenkins and start exploring your proposal areas.\nProject ideas include quick-start guidelines and reference newbie-friendly issues\nwhich may help with initial study.\nIf you do not see anything interesting,\nyou can propose your own project idea\nor check out ideas proposed by other CDF organizations\nparticipating in GSoC.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt‚Äôs not!\nWe are looking for more project ideas and for Jenkins contributors/users\nwho are passionate about Jenkins and want to mentor students.\nNo hardcore experience required, mentors can study the project internals together with students and technical advisors.\nWe are especially interested in ideas beyond the Java stack, and in ideas focusing new technologies and areas\n(e.g. Kubernetes, IoT, Python, Go, whatever).\n\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee the Call for Mentors post\nand Information for mentors for details.\nIf you want to propose a new project,\nplease do so as soon as possible so that students have time to explore them and to prepare their proposals.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nTestimonials from former Jenkins GSoC participants ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n\"I participated in Google Summer of Code 2020 in cooperation with the Jenkins organization\nand I work on a project called Windows Service Wrapper, which allows running Jenkins as a service on a Windows machine.\nGSoC was the most wonderful and the most valuable experience I gained during my student life.\nThe whole journey was full of experiences and Jenkins mentors always were there for us.\nI experienced a huge development of my skills while I was working on the project.\nI had many meetings, knowledge sharing sessions, and one pair-coding session with my mentors.\nOne of the best things that I learned is the open-source community and open source mentality.\nIt is not only about taking, but also about giving.\nToday I am maintaining an open-source project which is a simple programming language for kids\nwhich allows them to code in their native language, which will help to learn coding to students in rural areas of my country.\nFinally, Jenkins is a wonderful family and they always were there for us in all the ups and downs.\nI am proud to be a part of the Jenkins community.\"\n\nBuddhika Chathuranga, GSoC 2020 student, Support for YAML Configuration in Windows Service Wrapper\n\n\"My GSoC journey in the Jenkins community starts by a draft proposal full of comments from mentors and ends by two plugins with hundreds of installations.\nAlong with the daily coding review, the weekly meeting and the growth of the project,\nI increased my skills on programming and became a much more eligible engineer.\nWhat is more, the support from the whole Jenkins community leads me to a broader career path.\nI learned how to maintain a project, how to communicate with users and other developers on GitHub.\nMost importantly, the Jenkins community teaches me the principles of the open source world\nand welcomes me to the open source world with all their kind help.\"\n\nKezhi Xiong, GSoC 2020 students, GitHub Checks API project\n\n\"I worked as a Google Summer of Code student with the Jenkins project during the summer of 2019.\nThe project provided me with an excellent opportunity to contribute to the world‚Äôs most popular automation server,\nlearn about building performant and reliable applications, and interact with awesome people around the globe.\nJenkins' ever helpful and extremely knowledgeable community made working on my project a real treat.\nI even got a chance to present my project at DevOps World in Lisbon!\nIf you‚Äôre deciding which organization to work for this year, choose the Jenkins project‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâyou can‚Äôt have a better GSoC experience than this!\"\n\nAbhyudaya Sharma, GSoC 2019 student, Role Strategy Performance Improvements\n\n\"I participated in Google Summer of Code 2018 with Jenkins as a student developer.\nWorking for Jenkins in GSoC 2018 was one of the best experiences I have ever had.\nDuring 3 months of summer, I learned a lot of new things when working on the open-source project with Jenkins.\nAnother best thing about Jenkins is the people, I received a lot of support from my mentors\nand other developers from the Jenkins community when working on my project.\nAfter GSoC, I also had a chance to go to the Jenkins World Conference in San Francisco\nto meet and connect with my mentors and other people in the Jenkins community.\nOverall, GSoC with Jenkins was a great experience and\nI highly recommend Jenkins as a great community to kickstart your open source journey.\"\n\nPham Vu Tuan, GSoC 2018 student, Remoting over Apache Kafka project\n\nImportant dates for GSoC 2021\n\nApr 13 -
