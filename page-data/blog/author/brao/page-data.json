Adoption of Jenkins 2, which featured \"Pipeline as code\" and\nencouraged users to adopt Jenkins Pipeline, has\nskyrocketed to more than half of all Jenkins installations.  Other data\nremained consistent with findings year-to-year, for example, the number of\nJenkins users continues to increase and 90% of survey respondents still\nconsider Jenkins mission-critical.\n\nGet the survey infographic PDF\n\nGet the complete survey results in PDF\n\nHere are some of the key findings:\n\n85% of respondants indicated that Jenkins usage had increased\n\n30% of organizations with more than 50 software projects used Jenkins in 2016 as compared to 16% in 2015\n\nAn impressive 46% of respondents were running Jenkins 2.x, eight months after\nits release.\n\nAdoption of Jenkins Pipeline for continuous delivery\n(CD) is accelerating, 54% of respondents who have adopted CD are using Pipeline.\n\n61% of respondents are deploying changes to production at least once per week\n\nLinux is the platform of choice for builds, favored by 85% of respondents\n\n85% of respondants use Git as the source code repository\n\nHalf of respondents are deploying applications directly to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services as the favored platform\n\nWe want to thank everyone for completing the survey, and congratulations to\nIker Garcia for winning a free pass to\nJenkins World 2017 and to\nDave Leifer for winning the Amazon gift card.\n\nWe’re looking forward to creating a 2017 Community Survey later this year and\nhearing more from users at Jenkins World 2017 in San Francisco, we hope to\nsee you there!","title":"The State of Jenkins - 2016 Community Survey","tags":["community","survey","continuous delivery"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"https://www.cloudbees.com/blogs/bhavani-rao","github":null,"html":"","id":"brao","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Bhavani Rao","slug":"blog/author/brao","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"brao","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
