Please note that the database\nwill not be created by the plugin, the user has to create the database.\n\nConnection Timeout - Set the connection timeout duration in seconds.\n\nSocket Timeout - Set the socket timeout duration in seconds.\n\nCredentials - Configure authentication using username and password to the PostgreSQL instance.\n\nUse the Test PostgreSQL Connection button to verify that the details are correct and Jenkins is able to connect to\nthe PostgreSQL instance.\n\n[IMPORTANT] When configuring the plugin for the first time, it is highly important to press the Perform PostgreSQL\nSchema Initialization button. It will automatically perform schema initialization and create the necessary indexes.\nThe button can also be used in the case the database is wiped out and schema needs to be recreated.\n\nPress the Save button.\n\nNow, all the fingerprints produced by this Jenkins instance should be saved in the configured PostgreSQL instance!\n\nQuerying the Fingerprint Database\n\nDue to the relational structure defined by PostgreSQL, it allows users/developers to query the fingerprint data which\nwas not possible using the Redis fingerprint storage plugin.\n\nThe fingerprint storage can act as a consolidated storage for multiple Jenkins instances.\nFor example, to search for a fingerprint id across Jenkins instances using the file name, the following query could be\nused:\n\nSELECT fingerprint_id FROM fingerprint.fingerprint\nWHERE filename = 'random_file';\n\nA sample query is provided which can be tweaked depending on the parameters to be searched:\n\nSELECT * FROM fingerprint.fingerprint\nWHERE fingerprint_id = 'random_id'\n        AND instance_id = 'random_jenkins_instance_id'\n        AND filename = 'random_file'\n        AND original_job_name = 'random_job'\n        AND original_job_build_number = 'random_build_number'\n        AND timestamp BETWEEN '2019-12-01 23:59:59'::timestamp AND now()::timestamp\n\nThe facets are stored in the database as jsonb.\nPostgreSQL offers support to query jsonb.\nThis is especially useful for querying the information stored inside fingerprint facets.\nAs an example, the Docker Traceability Plugin stores information like the name of Docker images inside these\nfacets.\nThese can be queried across Jenkins instances like so:\n\n>'imageName' = 'random_container';\n\nAt the moment these queries require working knowledge of the database.\nIn future, these queries can be abstracted away by plugins and the features made available to users directly inside\nJenkins.\n\nDemo\n\nExternal Fingerprint Storage Demo\n\nSlide deck\n\nReleases ðŸš€\n\nWe released the 0.1-alpha-1 version for the\nPostgreSQL Fingerprint Storage Plugin.\nPlease refer to the\n\nchangelog for more information.\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin 1.0-rc-3 was also\nreleased.\nThe\n\nchangelog provides more details.\n\nA few API changes made in the Jenkins core were released in Jenkins-2.253.\nIt mainly includes exposing fingerprint range set serialization methods for plugins.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nThe relational structure of the plugin allows some performance improvements that can be made when implementing\ncleanup, as well as improving the performance of Fingerprint#add(String job, int buildNumber).\nThese designs were discussed and are a scope of future improvement.\n\nThe current external fingerprint storage API supports configuring multiple Jenkins instances to a single storage.\nThis opens up the possibility of developing traceability plugins which can track fingerprints across Jenkins instances.\n\nPlease consider reaching out to us if you feel any of the use cases would benefit you, or if you would like to share\nsome new use cases.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe

another great phase for the\nExternal Fingerprint Storage Project\ncomes to an end, we summarise the work done during this phase in this blog post.\nIt was an exciting and fruitful journey, just like the previous phase, and offered some great learning experience.\n\nTo understand what the project is about and the past progress, please refer to the\nphase 1 blog post.\n\nNew Stories Completed\n\nWe targeted four stories in this phase, namely fingerprint cleanup, fingerprint migration, refactoring the current\nimplementation to use descriptors, and improved testing of the Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin.\nWe explain these stories in detail below.\n\nFingerprint Cleanup\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4817\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/23\n\nThis story involved extending the FingerprintStorage API to allow external storage plugins to perform and configure\ntheir own fingerprint cleanup strategies.\nWe added the following functionalities to Jenkins core API:\n\nFingerprintStorage#iterateAndCleanupFingerprints(TaskListener taskListener)\n\nThis allows external fingerprint storage implementations to implement their own custom fingerprint cleanup.\nThe method is called periodically by Jenkins core.\n\nFingerprintStorage#cleanFingerprint(Fingerprint fingerprint, TaskListener taskListener)\n\nThis is a reference implementation which can be called by external storage plugins to clean up a fingerprint.\nIt is upto the plugin implementation to decide whether to use this method.\nThey may choose to write a custom implementation.\n\nWe consume these new API functionalities in the\nRedis Fingerprint Storage plugin.\nThe plugin uses cursors to traverse the fingerprints, updating the build information, and deleting the build-less\nfingerprints.\n\nEarlier, fingerprint cleanup was always run periodically and there was no way to turn it off.\nWe also added an option to allow the user to turn off fingerprint cleanup.\n\nThis was done because it may be the case that keeping redundant fingerprints in memory might be cheaper than the\ncleanup operation (especially in the case of external storages, which are cheaper these days).\n\nFingerprint Migration\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4825\n\nEarlier, there was no support for fingerprints stored in the local storage.\nIn this phase, we introduce migration support for users.\nThe old fingerprints are now migrated to the new configured external storage whenever they are used (lazy migration).\nThis allows gradual migration of old fingerprints from local disk storage to the new external storage.\n\nRefactor FingerprintStorage to use descriptors\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4834\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/36\n\nEarlier, whenever an external fingerprint storage plugin was installed, it was enabled by default.\nWe refactored the implementation to make use of Descriptor pattern so the fingerprint engine can now be selected\nas a dropdown from the Jenkins configuration page.\nThe dropdown is shown only when multiple fingerprint storage engines are configured on the system.\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin was refactored\nto use this new implementation.\n\nStrengthened testing for the Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/33\n\nWe introduced new connection tests in the\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin.\nThese tests allow testing of cases like slow connection, breakage of connection to Redis, etc.\nThese were implemented using the Toxiproxy module inside Testcontainers.\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/31\n\nWe introduced test for Configuration-as-code (JCasC) compatibility with the plugin.\nThe documentation for configuring the plugin using JCasC was also added.\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/39\n\nWe introduced a suite of authentication tests, to verify the proper working of the Redis authentication system.\nAuthentication uses the credentials plugin.\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/32\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/36\n\nWe strengthened our web UI testing to ensure that the configuration page for the plugin works properly as planned.\n\nOther miscellaneous tasks\n\nPlease refer to the Jira Epic for this phase.\n\nReleases ðŸš€\n\nChanges in the Jenkins core (except migration) were released in Jenkins 2.248.\n\nWe drafted 1.0-rc-1\nrelease for the Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\nto deliver the changes.\nThis was an increment from the alpha release\nwe had drafted at the end of the previous phase.\nThe plugin is now available at https://plugins.jenkins.io/redis-fingerprint-storage/!\n\nTrying out the new features!\n\nThe latest release for the plugin can be downloaded from the update center, instructions for which can be\nfound in the README\nof the plugin.\nWe appreciate you trying out the plugin, and welcome any suggestions, feature requests, bug reports, etc.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe Redis Fingerprint Storage plugin is built and maintained by the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Team for\nExternal Fingerprint Storage

The fingerprint engine of Jenkins can track usages of artifacts, credentials, files, etc. within the system. Currently, it does this by maintaining a local XML-based database which leads to dependence on the physical disk of the Jenkins controller.\n\nAllowing fingerprint storage to be moved to external storages decreases the dependence of Jenkins instances on the physical disk space and also allows for tracking the flow of fingerprints across instances of Jenkins connected to the same external storage.\n\nAdvantages of using external storage drivers:\n\nRemove dependence on Jenkins controller disk storage\n\nCan configure pay-as-you-use cloud storages\n\nEasy Backup Management\n\nBetter Reliability and Availability\n\nFingerprints can be tracked across Jenkins instances\n\nAlong with this API, we are also working on a reference implementation in the form of a plugin, powered by Redis.\n\nAs phase 1 of this project comes to an end, this blog post serves as a summary of the progress we made to the entire Jenkins community.\n\nCurrent State\n\nThe new API introduced in Jenkins core is under review. Once merged, it will offer developers to extend it to build external fingerprint storage plugins.\n\nThe Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin is alpha release ready. We would immensely appreciate any feedback.\n\nExternal Fingerprint Storage Demo\n\nIntroducing the new API for plugin developers\n\nWith PR-4731, we introduce a new fingerprint storage API, allowing configuring custom storage engines.\nWe exposed the following methods in the new FingerprintStorage class:\n\nvoid save()\n\nSaves the given Fingerprint in the storage.\n\nFingerprint load(String id)\n\nReturns the Fingerprint with the given unique ID. The unique ID for a fingerprint is defined by Fingerprint#getHashString().\n\nvoid delete(String id)\n\nDeletes the Fingerprint with the given unique ID.\n\nboolean isReady()\n\nReturns true if there is some data in the fingerprint database corresponding to the particular Jenkins instance.\n\nIntroducing Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin uses the new External Fingerprint Storage API to store the fingerprints in a Redis instance.\n\nInstallation:\n\nThe alpha release (version 0.1-alpha-1) for the plugin was drafted, and can be installed using the experimental update center.\n\nFollow along the following steps after running Jenkins to download and install the plugin:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Manage Plugins\n\nGo to Advanced tab\n\nConfigure the Update Site URL as: https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/update-center.json\n\nClick on Submit, and then press the Check Now button.\n\nGo to Available tab.\n\nSearch for Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin and check the box along it.\n\nClick on Install without restart\n\nThe plugin should now be installed on your system.\n\nUsage\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, you can configure the Redis server details by following the steps below:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Configure System\n\nScroll to the section Redis Fingerprint Storage Configuration and fill in the required details:\n\nHost - Enter hostname where Redis is running\n\nPort - Specify the port on which Redis is running\n\nSSL - Click if SSL is enabled\n\nDatabase - Redis supports integer indexed databases, which can be specified here.\n\nConnection Timeout - Set the connection timeout duration in milliseconds.\n\nSocked Timeout - Set the socket timeout duration in milliseconds.\n\nCredentials - Configure authentication using username and password to the Redis instance.\n\nEnabled - Check this to enable the plugin (Note: This is likely to be removed very soon, and will be enabled by default.)\n\nUse the Test Redis Connection to verify that the details are correct and Jenkins is able to connect to the Redis instance.\n\nPress the Save button.\n\nNow, all the fingerprints produced by this Jenkins instance should be saved in the configured Redis server!\n\nFuture Work\n\nSome of the topics we aim to tackle in the next phases include extending the API, fingerprint cleanup, migrations (internalâ†’external, externalâ†’internal, externalâ†’external), tracing, ORM, implementing the saveable listener, etc.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe Redis Fingerprint Storage plugin is built and maintained by the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Team for\nExternal Fingerprint Storage for Jenkins.\n\nSpecial thanks to Oleg Nenashev, Andrey Falko, Mike Cirioli, Jesse Glick, and the entire Jenkins community for all the contribution to this project.\n\nReaching Out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions, feedback, etc. on the projectâ€™s Gitter Channel or the Jenkins Developer Mailing list\n\nWe use Jenkins Jira to track issues.\nFeel free to file issues under redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin component.\n\nOther Links\n\nPhase 1 demo\n\nPresentation slides\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nIssue Tracker for Phase 1\n\njep:226[]\n\nGitter Channel\n\nProject Page","title":"External Fingerprint Storage Phase-1 Updates","tags":["plugins","fingerprint","cloud-native","external-storage","developer","redis","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/19e71/stellargo.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/77b35/stellargo.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/d4a57/stellargo.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/19e71/stellargo.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/ef6ff/stellargo.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/8257c/stellargo.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/6766a/stellargo.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://medium.com/@sumitsarinofficial","github":"stellargo","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2020 student.
