Thus marking a new beginning for many of us who had come to rely on this very versatile piece of software and wanted to see it continue to thrive.\n\nAlong with some other bug fixes, the 1.396 release of Jenkins included a very important changelog item:\n\nFixed a trademark bug that caused a considerable fiasco by renaming to Jenkins\n\nOn behalf of the core Jenkins team and the governance board I would like to extend a extremely large Thank You! to all of the plugin developers, bug filers, wiki page editors, book authors and the users who have helped grow Jenkins into the project it is today.\n\nSome of the tidbits from our highlight reel:\n\nAs of this writing there have been 54 releases of Jenkins\n\nJenkins now supports writing plugins in Ruby as well as Java (more languages in the process)\n\nWe have 7 high-speed mirrors streaming Jenkins packages to users around the world.\n\nThere are now over 450 different plugins available for Jenkins\n\nOver 80 donors participated in our end of year fundraising drive\n\n5 \"Long Term Support\" releases have been published by the Jenkins community, offering users a slower moving upgrade target (supported even further by CloudBees' Enterprise Jenkins product)\n\nPublic project governance meetings are held and recorded (almost) every couple of weeks.\n\nMore than 340 individuals contribute on GitHub to the project in some form or another.\n\nAbout 750 members of the developers mailing list and around 1700 on the users mailing list\n\nThere are many other impressive sounding numbers I could rattle off, but the list is far too long to be interesting.\n\nThe project isn’t perfect and nor is the software, but we’re off to a fine start and I hope you’ll join us in making this next year of Jenkins even better than the first.","title":"Happy birthday Jenkins!","tags":["general","core"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

As an infrastructure guy (part time), I can honestly say it’s a great tool and I’m grateful to PagerDuty for supporting Jenkins with our own account to help manage project infrastructure.\n\nA couple weekends ago I finished setting up Nagios (read-only username/password: jenkins / jenkins) for critical project services which by itself is a good step forward. Combine that with PagerDuty’s Nagios integration and a solid on-call rotation, and I’m more confident than I’ve ever been that Kohsuke or myself could actually take a vacation!\n\nCheck them out, and be sure to thank them on Twitter at @PagerDuty for supporting Jenkins!","title":"Thanks for the support PagerDuty!","tags":["infrastructure","meta"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

A journey that started over a year ago by Charles Lowell has reached a new level, thanks to lots of help from Kohsuke along with Hiroshi Nakamura and Jørgen Tjernø.\n\nAs of today, with Jenkins 1.438, you can now download and install Ruby plugins from the update center (the Path Ignore plugin being the first).\n\nWords simply can’t express what a monumental achievement this is for the Jenkins project, both from the technical perspective but also in terms of what this means for the future of the project.\n\nAccording to the languages dashboard on GitHub, Ruby is over two times as popular as Java on the site. I do not intend to start a language popularity contest here, but if we pretend just for a minute that the GitHub ecosystem is all that exists. Can you then imagine how powerful it would be to engage and include a community of open source developers that would be two times the size of the current pool of contributors? That’s tremendous potential!\n\nGreat! Where do I start?\n\nFor those that are curious, the first officially released Ruby plugin for Jenkins is Jørgen’s pathignore-plugin which can be found in the update center. If you’re looking for a reference project, this is currently the most up-to-date plugin.\n\nThere is also a wiki page covering Ruby plugin development , which might be a little out-of-date but covers most of the essentials.\n\nAdditionally you might find the jenkins-prototype-plugin an interesting resource as it is practically a kitchen sink of demo/test Ruby plugin code.\n\nCurrently only a few extension points (BuildStep, Publisher, BuildWrapper) are mapped in a Ruby-friendly manner. Don’t let that scare you though! If you dig around in the jenkins-plugin-runtime you can see how the existing extension points are mapped from Java into Ruby, because Ruby plugins are running under JRuby, if you need to access some Java APIs, you can do so without too much trouble.\n\nThe Thank Yous\n\nGreat efforts like this one don’t just happen without support, which is why I’d like to call out and thank The FrontSide for their wonderful support, helping to cover costs of WebEx for Office Hours and covering Charles' time while he worked with Kohsuke on the internal plumbing needed to make Ruby plugins possible within Jenkins core. If the name \"The FrontSide\" looks familiar to you, that might be because they also created and donated the Jenkins logo!\n\nWe should also thank Lookout, Inc ( full disclosure: Lookout is my employer) and CloudBees for affording some employee time for Jørgen and Kohsuke respectively to work on the project.","title":"The beginning of a new era: Ruby plugins now a reality","tags":["general","core","plugins","jruby"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
