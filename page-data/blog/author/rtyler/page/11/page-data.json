Unlike Kohsuke’s presentation, John spent a lot of time in demos which made live-blogging a bit difficult. image:https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4129/5012383102_cf258075a6.jpg\n\nJohn takes the stage at 9:30, this presentation is totally different from yesterday’s presentation from Kohsuke\n\nTaking Hudson a little further, beyond just scheduling a build job.\n\nWho is not using Hudson, less than 10% raise hands.\n\nFocusing on the more technical/nitty-gritty things with Hudson. Looking at:\n\nCI Basics\n\nNotification strategies\n\nQuality metrics\n\nBuild promotions\n\nAutomated deployment\nWho knows what build promotions? Who uses build promotions? Very few in the audience use build promotions.\n\nWho uses Hudson for automated deployment, a handful raise their hands. Plenty of Tomcat and JBOSS users automating deployment. John going to use Tomcat for the automated deployment demo in this presentation.\n\nJohn mentions he’s authoring the \"Continuous Integration with Hudson\" book, which will be available for download as it comes out.\n\nLet’s talk about Continuous Integration! Summing up what CI is in three words: feedback, visibility and delivery. CI is about snappy feedback. You want feedback in minutes.\n\nVisibility should be associated with continuous integration, getting everybody in the product life cycle into the loop with continuous integration (product people, QA, developers, etc).\n\nWhat makes Hudson so great? (according to John)\n\nEasy to use\n\nPlenty of plugins/the ecosystem around Hudson for extending/integrating Hudson\n\nReporting/coverage features\n\nDistributed builds\n\nFirst demo, the Hudson dashboard (starring the Nested View plugin). Starting with a basic dashboard filled with some unstable and stable builds. Cloudy builds thanks to Cobertura coverage grading.\n\nUsing the Nested View plugin to group views to make the dashboard more useflu for a ton of jobs.\n\nCovering build radiators, not enough of the audience uses radiators. John advocates commandeering big monitors for radiators as part of your \"notification strategy\"\n\nCovering the basic version control integration, John highly recommneds using a \"Repository Browser\". \"The point is, you want one\" John starts improvising with making some changes, pops over to Eclipse and refactors some code, commits and kicks off a build. Navigates to the source changes for the newly broken build in \"Sventon\", his repository browser of choice which was connected to the job\n\nJohn shows the job using Maven integration and deploying artifacts to the Maven repository he’s set up on his local machine.\n\nHudson will automatically keep track of jar files/war files, so enable the \"Discard Old Builds\" checkbox to prevent Hudson from eating all kinds of disk space. Useful to only discard the artifacts for the last X builds instead of the test results/code coverage.\n\nDesktop build notifiers are quite useful, email can tend to get clutter/lost in the mess with everything else coming into your inbox.\n\nTest results integration\n\nGoing into the test results dashboard per-build and the test-result and build time trends for a specific job.\n\nWhy is the build time trend useful? If the build suddenly takes a huge amount of time to run, you’ve likely got performance issues that need fixing.\n\nPublishing HTML reports\n\nStarring the HTML Publisher plugin! Using the plugin to publish HTML reports generated from easyb for publishing acceptance test results for more wide-spread consumption.\n\nBouncing from HTML reports to integrating with Sonar for code quality metrics\n\nBuild Promotion\n\nStarring the Promoted Builds plugin! Covering some similar concepts to Kohsuke’s talk yesterday but literally going into the Hudson configuration and setting it up.\n\nTime is running out, John’s flipping back and forth between the M2 release plugin and his automatic deployment to his local Tomcat environment.\n\nQ&A\n\"Can Hudson be used for other environments\". Yes! Supports a number of build plugins, MSBuild, NAnt, CMake, in addition to the freestyle build. \"Maven 3 support\" Sonatype is apparently working on an integrated version of Hudson with Maven 3, Hudson core planning support \"eventually.\"","title":"Live Blog: John Smart demos advanced Hudson usage","tags":["general","javaone"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Last year at JavaOne we had 230+ plugins\n\nEclipse Community Survey, Hudson adoption from 9.1% in 2009 to 21.8%\n\nDiscussing Hudson adoption, going over Hudson job postings on indeed.com going up compared to a stagnant Cruise Control.\n\nKohsuke introduces himself and InfraDNA, started Hudson in 2004/2005.\n\nFirst steps to CI, 10,000 foot overview of SCM monitoring/build/testing. Delving into using Hudson\nfor automating everything to get \"more out of your Hudson deployment.\n\n\"Interconnecting Jobs aka Workflows\"\n\nHudson allows for hosting many projects on one Hudson deployment, meaning you need a smaller number of administrators for a larger number of jobs compared to Cruise Control.\n\nBuilding Block #1: Triggering. Using \"upstream\" and \"downstream\" jobs ot interconnect jobs to form a workflow in Hudosn. Triggering is asynchronoys in Hudson, useful for separating builds and multiple test jobs. Splitting the build and test jobs so you build quickly test many tests in parallel.\n\nAvoid recompiling compilation/builds in the \"downstream\" test runs. \"Copy Artifact\" plugin very useful for passing built executables to test jobs.\n\nUpstream/downstream separation also highly useful for separating build and deployment into a continuous workflow.\n\nBuilding Block #2: Join plugin. Fan downstream jobs out and then bring everything back together for final\nsteps.\n\nShows Join plugin configuration screen because \"perhaps the configuration is a little unintuitive\".\n\nBuilding block #3: Fingerprints. Using MD5 checksums from artifacts to learn more about those artifacts in your\nHudson, tying together artifacts from different jobs/builds. Letting Hudson recording these fingerprints of those artifacts in your lifecycle allows Hudson to help you find out where/when those executables came from.\n\nFingerprinting mechanism good for tracking dependencies from third parties, Hudson uses 3rd party fingerprints to compute additional information. Also useful for aggregating reports.\n\nGoing a bit further using the \"build promotion plugin\" to weed out which builds are \"better than others.\" Taking fingerprints from a build job all the way through the life cycle and passing that fingerprint around test/smoke test jobs, if that passes, build passes on to more rigorous testing, only if it’s passed base-level testing. Basic model of promotion maps to a \"confidence level\", 1st level passes compilation, 2nd level passes smoke test, 3rd level passes expensive/time-consuming tests.\n\nOne of the reasons to use promotion in your lifecycle to ensure that artifacts meet a minimum \"confidence level\" so you’re not expending resources running the longer tests )think about a promotion hierarchy)\n\nDemo time!\n\nKohsuke demoing build promotion live with fingerprinting of sample jar files. Creating a \"component-X\" build and a \"test-X\" build. test-X job using the \"Copy Artifact\" plugin to grab artifacts from the component-X build.\n\nDefining the promotion criteria in \"component-X\", \"test-X\" promoted, indicates that certain builds promoted a build.\n\nEnd demo time!\n\nMaven Integration\n\nMaven integration highlights. Going over POM comprehension and simplified configuration due to more information\ngetting inferred from the POMs. Building dependency chains with Maven integration.\n\n\"That’s the basics, let’s talk about advanced integration with Maven\"\n\nParallel-module builds! Letting Hudson builds modules with a single checkbox, meaning wherever possible Hudson will try to build your modules in parallel when possible.\n\nIncremental builds! Only building changed modules in a build run to be more efficient, preventing the need to rebuild the whole project from scratch every time. Hudson’s SCM integration to determine what the mapping between files changed and modules needing to be built.\n\nPrivate Maven repositories! Avoiding artifacts being overwritten by others, telling Hudson to create a Maven repository per-project (at the expense of more bandwidth/disk space needed), helps segregate builds to avoid them stomping on each other.\n\nAfter-the-fact deployment, avoiding deploying modules unless the whole build is successful (all modules properly built). Instead of using mvn deploy, you tell Hudson to deploy to your Maven repository with a single checkbox.\n\nMatrix Project\n\nNo longer alpha! Production-ready!\n\nOften used to build/test across slight variations of build environments such as different platforms for a C++ project. Conceptually it’s like running your build in a for loop.\n\nHudson supports a number of different axes, most popular of which being a \"agent axis\" which allows you to use different labels or specific agents for the build. Hudson also supports arbirtrary text fields as axes to be passed along to the build steps as environment variables.\n\nTouching on \"filtering\" in the matrix project support to remove parts of an axis that you do not need. I.e if you have a \"platform\" and a \"browser\" axes for web testing, you can exclude the \"iexplore\" value of the \"browser\" axis when the \"platform\" axis is \"mac\".\n\nDemo time!\n\nDefining two axes, \"agent\" axis and the \"JDK\" axis to build against different JDK versions on linux, solaris and windows. Excluding \"touchstone builds\" to avoid rebuilding a large number of matrix builds unless a limited subset of the combinations successfully build. Used to avoid spending a lot of time spinning cycles on very obvious errors that the first few builds \"recognize\" immediately.\n\nEnd demo time\n\nDoing Selenium testing on Hudson\n\nUse \"Selenium Grid plugin\" to install Selenium binaries on all agents and prepares them all to talk to each other. Useful for \"overloading\" an existing Hudson cluster as a Selenium cluster.\n\nUsing labels in Hudson to better determine which node has which browser.\n\nSelenium integration is very powerful when combined with the join plugin and the matrix configuration support in Hudson for web testing across a large number of platforms and browsers.\n\nThe Hudson project has invested heavily in getting great cluster support which helps tremendously with Selenium which has invested as heavily in clustering.\n\nHow to you deal with Selenium needing a GUI while Hudson agents are largely headless. Use the Xvnc plugin! On Windows things are bit trickier, easier to let Hudson agent/service \"interact with desktop\" such that it can access dialogs/etc. Failing everything else, configuring Windows for auto-login and then have JNLP agents autostart at login will work for allowing the agent to use the GUI and network resources.\n\nThe rest of the session was dedicated to some good Q&A. Great session by Hudson’s founder.","title":"Live Blog: Kohsuke's Presentation at JavaOne","tags":["general","javaone"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

While Digg has been\nthe source of some controversy and press due to their recent redesign and corporate\nshake-ups, as far as the Hudson community goes they’ve been largely responsible for\na great case study on continuous deployment using Hudson and Gerrit. image:https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5005123971_403f24733d.jpg\n\nAttendees included all of InfraDNA (Kohsuke and Kedar), some folks from CloudBees, a\nnumber of local users/developers like LewisHam and myself, and\nto top off the list a couple Oracle employees including Winston Prakash who is now hacking on Hudson inside of Oracle.\n\nAs folks started arriving there was a lot of discussion around \"Hudson at Scale\", specifically\nregarding Hudson \"in the cloud\". We also got to hear about one of the most interesting Hudson\nuse-cases I’ve ever seen by Edward M. Goldberg who I’ll post an\ninterview with shortly, imagine using Hudson with thousands of machines, it’s that interesting.\n\nThrough the afternoon there were a number of great discussions concerning Hudson stability,\nengaging more of the community and nitty-gritty details regarding Hudson’s internals such\nas the plugin API.\n\nI’ve posted photos from the event on\nFlickr for posterity in case you’re interested. Overall I’d judge the meetup to be a success, it was a\nlot of fun and a great way to spend a Sunday with Hudson.\n\nIf you’re going to be at JavaOne, come track me down and let’s talk about Hudson, if you’re not in San Francisco for the event, you can always follow my updates on Twitter or hit up Flickr","title":"Pre-JavaOne Hudson Meetup Redux","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
