Besides snapping the photo below, I also managed to get yelled out by an old woman wearing a red \"security\" jacket; suffice to say my JavaOne experience is already everything I expected! image:https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/4997929716_1675745efe.jpg\n\nUnlike last year’s Oracle OpenWorld, which also shut down this segment of Howard St in San Francisco and took over the adjacent Yerba Buena Gardens, this event will be crammed together with JavaOne.\n\nAt this point I’m not sure what I can expect as far as the JavaOne portion of the event goes, we do have two Hudson related events scheduled:\n\nGetting More Out of Your Hudson - Monday at 10:00 a.m. - Hosted by our very own Kohsuke Kawaguchi, the session will be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Embarcadero.\n\nGetting More from Your CI Server: Taking Hudson to the Next Level - Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. - Hosted by the (in)famous John Smart the session will also be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Cyril Magnin 1.\n\nUnfortunately those were the only specifically-Hudson related tracks I could find, as Andrew Bayer has mentioned before, finding a proper schedule is near impossible. While at JavaOne, I intend on posting updates, pictures and maybe a little scathing commentary (they did give me a blogger pass for some silly reason).\n\nIf you’re going to be at JavaOne, think about coming and talking to me about how you/your company uses Hudson.
