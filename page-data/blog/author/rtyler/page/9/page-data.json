Absolutely zero\ndownloads were being redirected, meaning that cucumber, the 1U machine\ngraciously colocated by Contegix had served up\nfar more bits than I ever wanted it to.\n\nAs such, I would like to publicly apologize to Contegix on behalf of the\nJenkins project. Their support for the project has been tremendous but\nthis glitch caused such an incredible amount of traffic to be pushed through\ntheir network that I feel exceptionally bad about it (turns out, Jenkins is pretty popular!)\n\nNow, for the good news. In diagnosing and debugging this issue (in a\ncaffeine-fueled frenzy I might add) I managed to do a couple things:\n\nI corrected the redirection relatively easily\n\nI fixed our long-standing geo-location issue, finally enabling redirection to our european\nand asian mirrors!\n\nWithin 30 minutes of correcting the error, I was able to add two mirrors in\nGermany, re-enable one from Taiwan and add a new mirror in Japan!\n\nI’m hoping to add even more mirrors in even more regions as volunteers with\nbandwidth step-forward, if you’re interested in hosting a mirror you can drop\nme a line at tyler@linux.com.","title":"Mirror, mirror on the wall","tags":["infrastructure","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Jenkins is here to help!  With the Join Plugin you can do just that.  Over on the confluence page it’s got a number of examples and fancy flow charts.
