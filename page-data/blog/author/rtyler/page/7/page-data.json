Kinoshita ]\n\nJenkins will be represented at this years Bioinformatics Open Source Conference ( BOSC 2012) on July 13-14th in Long Beach, California. I will be talking about Jenkins during my talk about BioUno.\n\nBOSC 2012 will be held just before ISMB 2012, while registration is through ISMB you don’t have to register for ISMB in order to register for BOSC.\n\nI will be at the event with some Jenkins stickers and available to answer questions you might have about BioUno and Jenkins!\n\nAbout BioUno\n\nBioUno is a project that uses Jenkins as basis for building\nbiology workflows.\nBioUno provides an alternative update center with custom plug-ins for\nbioinformatics tools like\nMrBayes,\nStructure,\nFigtree,\nBeast,\namong others.\n\nWhile the actual task of analysing or displaying data is handled by specific\ntools, that are wrapped by plug-ins, Jenkins is responsible for user control,\nweb interface, notifications, distributed execution, job schedule and\nmanagement, as well as other important low level tasks.\n\nBioUno is similar to BioHPC,\nGalaxy and\nTaverna, in that all these tools enable creating and managing pipelines using different bioinformatics tools.\n\nHowever, as it is using Jenkins, BioUno has the advantage of having an Open Source community of hackers that can answer questions and provide assistance for creating new plug-ins. There is plenty documentation for extending Jenkins\nand troubleshooting issues, as well as plenty existing plug-ins (that can be used as reference while writing new plug-ins).\n\nThere are projects and plug-ins that enable Jenkins to use resources in clouds or turn Jenkins into a Hadoop node, for big data processing. The next steps of the project include the deployment of BioUno to a computer facility, basic infrastructure for BioUno, definition of the process for releasing plug-ins, the creation of more plug-ins and a study on how to handle large data structures, used by many bioinformatics tools.\n\nThe project is being developed by TupiLabs under MIT License, and contributions and new plug-ins are welcome.","title":"Jenkins and Bioinformatics, catch us at BOSC 2012","tags":["general","cia","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

A hundred other like-minded continuous integration enthusiasts and I packed a very posh Marriott Marquis for a full day of Jenkins excitement.\n\nFamed Hudson and Jenkins founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi delivered the opening address to a crowded room.\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zONIv2yCm1s/T7pLy0yCalI/AAAAAAAAANg/hXadCIg5XC0/s1600/kohsuke.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zONIv2yCm1s/T7pLy0yCalI/AAAAAAAAANg/hXadCIg5XC0/s320/kohsuke.jpg[image,width=239,height=320]]\n\n+\nI'm sure everyone knows the statistics by now, that Jenkins adoption and development continues at an unbridled pace. Pushing past all the mailing list users and posts, the JIRAs opening and closing, the Twitter followers, the *five* Jenkins User Conferences scheduled for this year, the unprecedented number of installations reporting anonymous usage, the native availability for *nine* different OSes, in pushing past all of that.. +\n +\nFor me, the most impressive number was that on average there was about 1 plugin created every day over the past year. Let me reiterate that: *1 plugin created every day for a year*. If that isn't the best testament to the versatility, extensibility, and just plain usefulness of a piece of software, then I don't know what would be! +\n +\nAnnounced at the conference was the general availability of https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees BuildHive], this is a mechanism for quickly and easily obtaining access to cloud-based Jenkins. If you have projects on https://github.com/[GitHub], you can effortlessly log in to BuildHive via GitHub OAuth, import your projects with literally a single click, and start benefiting from the powerful promise of the cloud. You'll no longer have to worry about managing infrastructure, you'll just get all that great Jenkins CI capability for your projects immediately. +\n +\n +\n +\nWith BuildHive enabled projects, if a user of your project creates a pull request, then it will automatically pre-test that request before it hits the master tree -- https://github.com/jenkinsci/naginator-plugin/pull/2#issuecomment-5732481[commenting inside the pull request] whether or not the change broke the build. If a developer wants to test some changes before pushing them to the master tree, there's the https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb[Validated Merge feature], which can be used to screen commits before they land in master. Both of these features are wickedly awesome, to not use them would be a mistake for any F/OSS community. +\n +\nI would encourage you to try out BuildHive, it's already active for most/all of the Jenkins plugins. There's also an existing https://groups.google.com/d/topic/jenkinsci-dev/kqPAOziY1as/discussion[RFC thread] which is in discussion for making this the de facto location for Jenkins plugin on Jenkins testing. Please give it a shot and then post your comments. +\n +\nAside from this major announcement, I think the most interesting perspective I took away from the conference was the sheer diversity of Jenkins exploitation. People are using it on all sorts of hardware platforms, from mobile to cloud, on all sorts of languages from Java and C/C++ to Python and Ruby. I was also impressed with how many teams are using Jenkins as part of their mission critical business process. +\n +\nFinally, I'd like to thank all the Jenkins developers and users for making it the best continuous integration software available today.

Jenkins is starting to get to be that age, having been started over 6 years ago.\n\nOne of the most commonly asked questions, is about Jenkins' use of \"blue balls\" to indicate success by default. This is enough of an \"issue\" for some users that the Green Balls plugin is in the list of top 10 installed plugins.\n\nThe reason behind our use of blue to indicate success has its basis in Kohsuke’s Japanese upbringing. The cultural differences were enumerated in a bug report comically titled \"s/blue/green/g\" ( JENKINS-369):\n\nThis response Kohsuke cited was taken from this Q&A thread\n\nQ.\" Why do Japanese people say that they have blue traffic lights when they are really green?\" --Question submitted by John Sypal\n\nA: According to the book, Japan From A to Z: Mysteries of Everyday\nLife Explained by James and Michiko Vardaman, the first traffic\nsignals in Japan were blue instead of green, but the blue lights were difficult to see from a long distance away so they were replaced with green ones. Vardaman says that the custom of referring to traffic lights is a holdover from those days.\n\nThis sounds like a good explanation, but the problem with it is that you will hear Japanese people refer to other green things (like\ncucumbers, spinach, and sometimes grass) as being blue as well. This\nis because historically, Japanese people considered green to be a\nshade of blue. For example, the Chinese character for blue,\npronounced ao is made up of two characters, iki (life) and i (well)\nand refers to the colour of plants which grow around a well, a colour between green and blue. When Chinese people see the character, they say it means green, but Japanese people say it means blue.\n\nJapanese books on colours tell us that there are four tertiary colours: red, blue, white and black, and that all others are shades of those four main ones. Ao, therefore, is a sort of ideal blue, halfway between green and blue. The sky is said to be blue, but it is a different shade of ao than a traffic light is. Tree leaves are said to be green, but green is a shade of ao, like crimson is a shade of red.\n\nIn another interesting cultural difference relating\nto colour, Japanese children always colour the sun red instead of\nyellow.\n\n( here’s a direct link to Kohsuke’s comment )\n\nUnfortunately it’s not for color blind users, although that’s a pretty convincing explanation. Jenkins has blue balls because in Japan, red means stop and blue means go!\n\nImage courtesy of this site","title":"Why does Jenkins have blue balls?","tags":["general","just for fun","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

The second major milestone for the project was that we went to FOSDEM 2012, arguably the largest volunteer-organized and operated open source conference on the planet.\n\nWe had a couple of things going on at FOSDEM that merit a mention:\n\nThe Jenkins project had a stand in the K building, the same building where the Free Java, Config and Systems Management, and a few other pertinent dev rooms were located\n\nThe Jenkins project gave away 2 free copies of John Smart’s book: \" Jenkins: The Definitive Guide\" (thanks to O’Reilly!)\n\nCommunity member R. Tyler Croy gave a talk on running the Jenkins project infrastructure with Puppet\n\nThe O’Reilly folks brought 10+ Jenkins books to sell at their stand.\n\nProject founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi and a number of project members held a constructive UI Enhancements discussion.\n\nWe were very fortunate to have so many Jenkins contributors in attendance, who all helped with the Jenkins stand, introducing people to Jenkins and much more.\n\nFOSDEM in their own words\n\n( after the break)\n\nNicholas de Loof :\n\nFOSDEM was for me an opportunity to meet other Jenkins contributors I only knew by IRC nickname. Those two days were awesome to discuss with users on our stand, joke and socialize, as well as having some more technical debates and encourage folks to get involved in the community. Even I couldn’t attend the talks I selected on the conference agenda due to room being full, I really enjoyed this 100% geek weekend.\n\nChristopher Orr :\n\nThe people, the talks, the social events, the sheer size of FOSDEM all make for a pretty inspiring weekend.  And incredibly, it’s all for free.\n\nYou can not help but feel motivated after attending.  You always learn something new, discover myriad projects — in niches you never knew existed — and talk to smart folk from all over.\n\nTalking to people at the Jenkins stand was no different.  Though in a striking number of cases, people had already heard of Jenkins, were big fans and took a clutch of stickers back home for their colleagues.\n\nSpeaking with those who weren’t yet using Jenkins was equally\ninteresting. My favourite was talking to one guy who described a\nparticularly complex workflow; at each step he asked if Jenkins could do it, and I was able to cheerily reply \"yes\" to every single one.\n\nGetting to put faces to names of Jenkins developers was also a huge plus, and resulted in numerous great conversations.\n\nDomi :\n\nIt was great to get some faces to the short names on IRC. Talking to other commiters was awesome, I thought they are cool before I went to FOSDEM, but now I know!\n\nIts was great to talk to people who are using the tools you are working on, there where so many just coming up to say thank you! (?and there where/are by far more then I thought!)\nI know I’m standing on the shoulders of a giant - but I also do feel that my commitment is of value for others too.\n\nFeels great to be part of this community!\n\nR Tyler Croy :\n\nI spent so much time at the stand telling people about Jenkins or showing them, that I only ended up seeing a couple actual sessions the whole weekend.\nThe kinds of people who came to talk to us almost entirely developers of one kind or another, which was really great to talk about how Jenkins can be used effectively for Perl shops, for Python, C++, C#, Java (of course) or even for deployment automation. The spread was a pretty big endorsement, I think, of the extensible nature of the Jenkins plugin ecosystem.\nIn planning for FOSDEM I had urged Kohsuke to order thousands of stickers for the event, and when all was said and done I think we had given away around 1000 stickers to new Jenkins fans, old Jenkins fans and a few folks in the community who were looking forward to going back to their local JUG to share.\n\nI’m looking forward to making the trip to the bitter cold of Brussels in February again next year.\n\nFred G :\n\nFOSDEM had lots of interesting talks and was very well organized (from my point of view) and best of all…​ it’s free! Apart from the talks and nice lineup of speakers, it has been a great opportunity to meet people. People I already knew, some in person, some only from IRC, the mailing list, or as a maintainer of a plugin; but also people thatcame up to the Jenkins stand.\n\nFrom the people that I talked to:\n\n60% knew Jenkins and use it every day (\"Yeah, I know Jenkins. The whole company uses it and nothing works without it!\")\n\n35% had heard of it or were very interested (\"I know Jenkins, but we bought the Atlassian package and now we have to use Bamboo, Jira and Confluence.\" [me mentioning the Jira integration of Jenkins] \"Wow, I really have to try that out and convince our team to switch to Jenkins!\".\n\n5% Weirdos and WTF!? ( disgusted\"Is this another one of these\nprojects funded by Red Hat? They fund everything!\")\n\nMeeting Tom Huybrechts without knowing it (at first) was a big\nsuprise. He has created or contributed to some of the best plugins\n(eg. the parameterized-trigger plugin) and I see his name at least\nonce whenever I browse through core source code. During the impromptu UI enhancement meetings he showed us another three plugins that he wrote but never made public just because he doesn’t have time to support them all.\n\nThen at the stand he casually mentioned that he is administering\naround 3000 jobs on 100+ build machines. At the same time he seems\nlike a very humble and low key character.\n\nTo sum it up, the best thing about an open source project like Jenkins is the community. Working together with nice people from all over the world to create the best CI server has been a great experience. The FOSDEM weekend was another event that proved that.\nI’ll definitely come back.\n\nKohsuke Kawaguchi :\n\nFOSDEM is one of the few conferences that has a distinctive hand-made geek-for-geek feeling to it. No marketing people, no bullshit flyers, but lots of technical folks and good beer. I really enjoyed talking to users, as always, but above all I was very happy to see developers and project members in the Jenkins community come out in full force, and I felt they enjoyed it just as much. I’m really hoping that we’ll now keep this going for years to come.\n\nI think it’s safe to assume we’ll be back next year for FOSDEM 2013, hope to see you there!","title":"FOSDEM 2012 Recap","tags":["general","meetup","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
