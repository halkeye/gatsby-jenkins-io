We do not longer use the IRC chat for that purpose.\n\n#jenkins-cert - no private chat going forward. The Security Team will use mailing lists only going forward\n\n#jenkins-community - Replaced by the Advocacy&Outreach Gitter channel.\n\nFreenode concerns and disclaimers\n\nGoing forward, the Jenkins community does not have ANY official channels on Freenode.\nAll channels are either removed or left abandoned.\nWe no longer manage or control our channels.\nMost of the Jenkins IRC channel operators use IRCCloud,\nand hence they were banned by the Freenode team on June 11th.\nOnly a few operators have reconnected since this event.\n\nTaking the takeover of Freenode and hostile actions taken by the new management,\nwe can no longer guarantee any of the following:\n\nAuthenticity of registered users on Freenode.\nAll IRC accounts, cloaked or not, might have been taken over by the new Freenode management.\n Do not trust messages from the Jenkins contributor account IDs there.\n\nConfidentiality of private channels like #jenkins-cert.\nWe performed audit of the conversations there, and we believe there are no undisclosed security vulnerabilities referenced in the channel.\n After all, this IRC has been rather dormant for the last 18 months.\n\nIRC User Passwords.\nAll passwords on Freenode IRC may be compromised in the future.\nWe strongly advise all users to rotate their passwords if they were used on Freenode IRC.\n\nWe have made backups of IRC channel conversations in the abandoned channels.\nIf you need to access the conversation history, please reach out to the Jenkins Infrastructure team.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the entire Libera Chat team and all contributors who have worked on creating\na Freenode replacement for hundreds of open source communities using IRC.\nWithin just a month, a new platform has been created and adopted by almost all active projects.\nWe remember the Hudson to Jenkins renaming days when a similar mobilization happened in the Jenkins community,\nand we appreciate all the effort put by contributors.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels\nand our automation like the IRC Bot used by the Jenkins hosting team.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn the Jenkins community we will keep using Libera Chat IRC and maintaining user and contributor channels there.\nOther Jenkins chat channels like Gitter and Slack are unchanged.\nWe intend to gradually replace many of those channels with community.jenkins.io.\nThis is a new portal powered by Discourse.\nThe service is sponsored by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc..\nIt is currently in preview, stay tuned for announcements.\nAs always, we will appreciate any suggestions and [feedback]( https://community.jenkins.io/c/site-feedback/2)!","title":"Jenkins IRC moves to

would like to announce changes in the Jenkins Governance Board.\nAs it was announced earlier this month, Marky Jackson has decided to step down from his elected roles.\nOn behalf of the Jenkins community, we would like to thank Marky for all contributions and for the continued participation in the Jenkins community.\nAs an active Jenkins contributor and community leader, Marky helped a lot of initiatives to happen:\n Jenkins and Kubernetes ecosystem, terminology changes, GSoC and GSoD, pipeline authoring SIG and many more activities.\nThank you Marky!\n\nThe governance board has followed the interim procedure\nto nominate the new governance board member until the end of the term.\nThe board decided to respect the results of the 2020 elections and\nto nominate Ewelina Wilkosz who received the most of the votes after the elected candidates.\nShe has accepted the nomination, and on March 10th the Governance Meeting has confirmed it.\nWe are happy to welcome Ewelina Wilkosz as a new Governance Board Member!\n\nEwelina will join other governance Board Members:\nKohsuke Kawaguchi,\nUllrich Hafner,\nOleg Nenashev, and\nGavin Mogan.\nThe term will last until December 2022.\n\nAbout Ewelina Wilkosz\n\nEwelina has been a Jenkins Contributor since 2017, when she got involved in Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin development.\nVoted Most Valuable Jenkins Contributor in 2018.\nShe has 14 years of experience in IT, working as a CI/CD consultant since the beginning of 2017.\nIn that role she’s trying to solve numerous issues Jenkins users are facing daily - as developers, administrators, maintainers.\n\nHere is Ewelina’s statement from the elections:\n\nAs a consultant I support my customers with their Jenkins issues since the beginning of 2017.\nAnd almost from the start it was some kind of \"as code\" approach.\nThe experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.\nI consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.\nI appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is.\n\nI am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience\nwith Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.\nEvery day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.\nAs a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.\n\nThanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development\nI had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations\nwhere I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.\nHere are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:\nblogpost,\ncdCON presentation,\npodcast recording.\nSo my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,\nso I actually know what they need and why.\n\nWhat’s next for the Jenkins Governance Board?\n\nIn February we had the Jenkins Contributor Summit.\nThere we discussed many topics related to the Jenkins evolution and its roadmap.\nWe identified several initiatives we would like to focus on,\nincluding but not limited to improving user experience, contributor onboarding, and securing Jenkins delivery pipelines.\nThese initiatives will be a key focus until the next contributor summit we plan to organize in June.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and facilitating contributions to the project.\n\nParticipating in Jenkins Governance\n\nJenkins Governance Board has just a representative function in the community.\nThe project and the community have a long history of open and inclusive governance driven by many contributors.\nWe invite all community members to participate in the project by joining the\ngovernance meeting,\nparticipating in the mailing list conversations,\nand joining special interest groups driving particular topics.\n\nSee this page to know more about contributing to Jenkins in general.","title":"Welcome Ewelina Wilkosz - new Jenkins Governance Board

Jenkins community congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!\nLet’s take a look at some changes this year.\nWe would like to thank all awesome Jenkins users and contributors who have been with us during this year.\n\nHighlights\n\nSome of the key highlights:\n\nHundreds of first-timer contributors joined the community\n\nMajor UI/UX improvements in the Jenkins core, including the landing page, plugin manager, dark theme, and read-only configurations support\n\nOutreach programs like Google Summer of Code (7 projects), Google Season of Docs, UI/UX hackfest, etc.\n\nPublic roadmap for the project\n\nTerminology changes in the project, new Code of Conduct\n\nTechnical debt cleanup: XStream unforking, Acegi Security replacement, etc.\n\nContinued evolution of the plugin ecosystem, especially in the area of Cloud Native solutions and tool integrations\n\nContinued documentation cleanup, great progress with plugin documentation migration\n\nGraduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins User Interface and User Experience\n\nThis year there were many activities around Jenkins user experience and long-anticipated user interface changes.\nThis is a coordinated effort being led by the User Experience SIG, and by many contributors to the project.\nKey project highlights:\n\nLook & Feel updates of the Jenkins Web UI, including styling rework, new typography and layouts\n\nMajor rework of plugin management UI/UX\n\nDark theme for Jenkins\n\nAccessibility improvements\n\nSupport for read-only configuration pages\n\nIn May we also organized a Jenkins UI/UX hackfest where we worked on some key stories improving user experience.\n\nJenkins security\n\nIn 2020 the Jenkins security team has released 19 advisories for the Jenkins core, plugins and other components.\nIn total 198 vulnerabilities were fixed, and 72 plugin vulnerabilities were announced without a fix at the time of advisory publishing.\nAs a project, we are receiving a continuous flow of new reports and continue to provide corrections.\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were the most popular type this year, followed by unprotected credentials.\n\nThere have also been developer tooling improvements,\nincluding GitHub CodeQL evaluation for targeted security issues search\nand Find-Sec-Bugs adoption for static analysis of the plugin and Jenkins core code.\nAlong with wider adoption of Dependabot and automated dependency scanning on GitHub.\n\nDocumentation\n\nJenkins Documentation SIG is working on creating more documentation for Jenkins on different platforms,\nincluding cloud platforms.\nJenkins on Kubernetes was one of the key stories this year for the SIG,\nalong with documentation migration to jenkins.io and wider adoption of Documentation-as-code in plugins.\n95% of the 200 most installed Jenkins plugins have moved to \"documentation as code\" or have a pending pull request with updates.\nIn total, almost 600 plugins have already been migrated.\nThere were major updates in Jenkins documentation on jenkins.io, with a lot of content being moved from the old Jenkins Wiki.\n\n2020 was the first year when Jenkins participated in Google Season of Docs (GSoD).\nThis program brings together open-source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nThis year’s student, Zainab Abubakar,\ndid an amazing job documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nNow Jenkins users can find official documentation about deploying and scaling Jenkins in Kubernetes.\nSee the project report by Zainab here.\n\nJenkins Release Automation\n\nThe Jenkins project has delivered weekly and long term support releases since it was formed in 2011.\nThose releases were delivered by Kohsuke Kawaguchi from his release infrastructure.\n\nBeginning in April 2020, those releases are delivered by the new release automation setup.\nIt is hosted within the Jenkins’ Kubernetes cluster, with fully automated management and continuous delivery of services within the setup.\nWe transitioned to new build processes, new code signing certificates, and new release automation jobs.\nThanks to Olivier Vernin and all Infrastructure sub-project contributors for the successful completion of the release automation project!\n\nMoreover, there is ongoing work on continuous delivery of Jenkins plugins ( JEP-229) and on re-designing other Jenkins instances within the project (infra-ci, trusted-ci, and ci.jenkins.io for plugins).\nIn the next few months these stories should provide Jenkins contributors with a modern environment for CI and CD of all Jenkins components.\n\nTerminology updates\n\nSince July, we have officially replaced the old \"master\" terminology with the \"controller\" term.\nIt is a follow-up to the \"agent\" terminology introduced in 2016.\nWe have also deprecated usages of the “blacklist/whitelist” terminology in all components.\nCurrently the community is working on the cleanup of the remaining occurrences in the codebase and documentation, and we invite everyone to contribute.\n\nAs a part of the terminology cleanup, last spring we announced the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.\nAs a reminder, it does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.\n\nSee more information about terminology updates here and here.\n\n“Jenkins is the Way” program\n\nThis year the Advocacy and Outreach SIG started the “Jenkins is the Way” initiative which focuses on promoting user success stories.\nOver the year, the team published 54 user stories and six case studies on https://jenkinsistheway.io/ as well as a significant amount of community marketing.\nWe also published a number of testimonial videos advertising user stories,\nincluding this Introduction to \"Jenkins is the Way\" video.\n\nSee all the stories HERE\n\nEvents\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nIn 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.\nWe had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.\nAs usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.\nThe projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes needed for the long-term evolution of Jenkins.\n\nThis is the first-ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.\nIt was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!\n\nRead more: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/22/gsoc-report/\n\nJenkins in Hacktoberfest 2020\n\nIn October we participated in Hacktoberfest.\nOur featured projects included the Jenkins core, jenkins.io website and plugins.jenkins.io, Helm charts, and multiple plugins.\nWe also encouraged contributors to participate in the Documentation as Code and terminology cleanup across the entire Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nSee the details in the Hacktoberfest page.\n\nIn total we received 226 pull requests from Hacktoberfest participants.\nSome stats per Jenkins GitHub organization:\n\n'jenkinsci', PRs: 189, Hacktoberfest contributors: 61\n\n'jenkins-infra', PRs: 100, Hacktoberfest contributors: 40\n\n'jenkins-zh', PRs: 37, Hacktoberfest contributors: 2\n\nJenkins at DevOps World\n\nThe annual DevOps World,\nformerly known as DevOps World | Jenkins World held on Sept 22-24, with workshops on Sept 25.\nJust like other events in 2020, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that didn’t mean there was a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There were over 50 Jenkins/open-source.\nAnd a special congratulations is in order to this year’s Jenkins Contributor Award winners:\n\nJames Holderness - Jenkins security MVP\n\nMarky Jackson - Most valuable Jenkins advocate\n\nTim Jacomb - Most valuable Jenkins contributor\n\nBelow are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :\n\nJenkins Where It Is and Where It Is Going\n\nOne Jenkins to Rule them All\n\nJenkins UI Gets a Makeover\n\nJenkins Pipeline and DevSecOps for API Security\n\nGraduation at Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.\nIn August the project announced that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).\nThanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!\nBelow you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:\n\nWe introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.\nThis roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.\nIt makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters, and at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.\nThe roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in JEP-14.\n\nA new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.\nThis list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,\nincluding ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.\nPlease do not hesitate to add your company there!\n\nWe passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.\nThis certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices and to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).\nIt also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.\nDetails are on the Jenkins core page.\n\nJenkins Code of Conduct was updated to the new version of Contributor Covenant.\nIn particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.\n\nMore information can be found HERE, and HERE.\n\nPublic Roadmap\n\nThe Jenkins project now has a public, community-driven project roadmap.  Roadmap items are major initiatives and are considered as official plans.\nThe roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all areas of the project.\n\nMany of the 2020 released roadmap items are mentioned elsewhere in this document, including release automation, Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification,\nuser interface improvements, read-only configuration pages,\nand Google Summer of Code projects like the GitHub Checks API or External Fingerprint Storage.\n\nOther roadmap items include mirror infrastructure improvements, a new Windows installer,\nand preview releases of pluggable storage for external fingerprints, build logs, and unit test results.\n\nJenkins 2020 Elections\n\nIn October-December the Jenkins community held the regular elections.\nThis year we were  electing for 2 governance board members and for all five officer positions, namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation. These roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being. We thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.\n\nKey results:\n\nGavin Mogan and Marky Jackson joined the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nTim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer\n\nMarky Jackson became the new Events Officer\n\nOlivier Vernin, Daniel Beck, and Mark Waite will continue as Infrastructure, Security and Documentation officers\n\nFull election results: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/03/election-results/\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project,\nit is just a slice of the key highlights mentioned by the contributors.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day. We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size. Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc. THANKS A LOT TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTechnical changes. 2021 will be another busy year for the Jenkins community.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want Jenkins to succeed.\nThere are many areas on the roadmap : UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nThere will also be a continued cleanup of old dependencies and technical debt.\nSeveral key changes are expected to land in the March LTS baseline: update to Spring Security, XStream unforking, JQuery update, etc.( announcement).\nIn addition to that, we will keep working on expanding platform support in Jenkins, including provisioning support for new Java versions and official images for more architectures like Arm.\n\nDocumentation. Documentation efforts will continue in the next year,\nwith a focus on documenting Jenkins usage on modern platforms and and automation use-cases.\nWide adoption of documentation-as-code will also continue for plugins By this time almost 600 plugins have been migrated, but there are hundreds more plugins to go.\n\nSecurity. Another important area is Jenkins security. Automation tools like Jenkins are a key part of the software delivery process in organizations, and their security is essential for the security of products.\nMisconfigured or outdated systems are a common attack vector, but there are also areas for improvement on the project’s side.\nBe sure there will be security advisories and vulnerability fixes in 2021.\nWe plan to keep adopting best security development and software delivery practices, and to improve dependency management and developer tools in the project. These areas will be in the spotlight for the project next year.\n\nEvents. Next month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a virtual Jenkins stand there.\nThere will also be a CI/CD devroom.\nIf you are interested to meet Jenkins contributors, it is a great opportunity. We also plan to continue all outreach programs and on onboarding more contributors.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement).\nWe are also ready to consider other non-coding project ideas as a part of CommunityBridge.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nJoin us in 2021!\n\nWe are always looking for more contributors, regardless of the profile and experience.\nJenkins is a vast ecosystem which includes many modern technologies.\n\nWe invite Jenkins users and contributors to participate in the community and to move these initiatives forward!\nJoin us in the mailing lists and special interest groups,","title":"2020 A Year Like No Other","tags":["community","new-year-blogpost","governance"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

Thanks a lot to them!\n\n.\n\nThanks a lot to all mentors who were guiding students during their projects:\nZhao Xiaojie,\nKristin Whetstone,\nParichay Barpanda,\nMartin d’Anjou,\nOleg Nenashev,\nAndrey Falko,\nMike Cirioli,\nMark Waite,\nFrancisco Fernandez,\nJustin Harringa,\nOmkar Deshpande,\nUlli Hafner,\nTim Jacomb,\nKara de la Marck,\nJames Strachan,\nNeha Gupta,\nOscar Medina,\nNikhil Da Rocha,\nSahil Kalra,\nBruno P.

the GSoC organization stipend from Google and other donations,\nthe Jenkins project usually provides travel grants to successful students so that they can visit a major community event, meet their mentors and community members in person, and present their work there.\nHere are some notes about the GSoC 2019 travel.\nUnfortunately this year it was not possible, and GSoC went completely virtual this year.\n\nOnline meetups\n\nIn August we organized Jenkins Online Meetups where students have presented their projects\n( part 1, part 2).\nYou can find recordings of these presentations in this playlist on the Jenkins YouTube channel.\n\nDevOps World\n\nThis year CloudBees, one of the Jenkins corporate sponsors, invited all students to participate in the DevOps World virtual conference on September 23-25.\nGSoC students did lighting talks about their projects, attended other conference talks, and joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation booth which represented the project at the conference.\nYou can find recordings of the talks and all materials here.\nAlthough the conference was in September, the talks were pre-recorded in early August.\nPlease refer to the Jenkins online meetup recordings for the recent versions.\n\nGSoC Mentor summit\n\nThis is a regular gathering for Google Summer of Code mentors and org admins where they share their experiences about GSoC, outreach programs, community management, and tools.\nUsually it is organized as a multi-day unconference after the end of GSoC, with 2-3 representatives from each project.\nIt has been a great learning experience to participate in it.\nThis year it was a single-day virtual event, and all mentors were able to attend.\nShivay Lamba, one of the GSoC 2020 mentors, also did a lightning talk about the GSoC projects he was working on in Jenkins and CNCF ( slides).\n\nSwag\n\nAll Google Summer of Code students and mentors get swag from Google.\nThis year, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) has sponsored swag for 50 most active GSoC participants:\nall students, mentors, and many other contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.\nThis is the third year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag,\nIn the previous years the swag logistics was one of the most challenging tasks for org admins during the entire project.\nand we highly appreciate help from CDF with this part.\nAs DevOps World presenters, the students have also received special edition speaker swag from CloudBees.\n\nThanks a lot to Google, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) and CloudBees!\n\nRetrospective\n\nAfter completion of the coding phases,\norg admins have reached out to all GSoC 2020 participants to gather their feedback and suggestions.\nWe also recommended that project teams hold their own retrospective meetings.\nSuch information is instrumental to continuously improving GSoC in the Jenkins community.\nWe thank all contributors who shared their feedback!\n\nThe organization-wide retrospective was organized as a survey and a series of retrospective meetings.\nYou can find aggregated results in this Google Doc.\nOverall, we received very positive feedback from students and mentors.\nThe GSoC framework in Jenkins has matured significantly during the previous years.\nThe effort we invested to create guidelines and recommendations for all parties helped a lot because all the expectations were known in advance.\nAs usual, there is much to improve, especially with regards to the community bonding phases and cross-project communications.\nWe are processing the feedback, and we will expand our documentation and the contributor onboarding plans next year.\n\nSome personal notes\n\nI have been involved in leading and coordinating Google Summer of Code in open source projects since 2016.\nThis year I visited the GSoC stand at FOSDEM and met a few organizers and former students.\nA few days after, I proposed participating in GSoC at the Jenkins contributor summit in Brussels,\nand several contributors supported this idea.\nWe spent several hours to create the first Jenkins GSoC page and brainstorm on project ideas.\nWe submitted our application and were accepted.\nThanks a lot to the Google team that gave us a chance!\n\nIt is great to work with the students and see how they explore the open source community and grow professionally as engineers.\nIt is also awesome to see how some of them stay in the project and keep contributing,\nincluding becoming plugin maintainers and GSoC mentors.\nBut, for me, Google Summer of Code is not just about mentoring.\nIt also helps a lot with the community bonding…​ for the existing community like Jenkins which has a lot of isolated sub-communities in plugins.\nMany maintainers work alone, and it can be quite lonely working to maintain a plugin without feedback, developer ideas, and user interactions.\nWhen plugin contributors become project mentors, they join the wider community effort and work in teams.\nIn many cases they start contributing to the organization-wide activities and goals,\nand it grows the \"backbone\" of the Jenkins community.\nLike other community-driven projects, we need such backbone to scale the community and onboard more contributors to the countless Jenkins components.\nSo far it works really well and GSoC excels among outreach programs in this regard.\n\nI would like to thank the Google Open Source team, students and all Jenkins community members for the great Google Summer of Code this year.\nWe also thank the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help to recognize contributors and allow organization administrators to focus on projects.\nLast but not least, I would like to thank the Jenkins org admin team:\nMartin d’Anjou,\nMarky Jackson, and\nKara de la Marck.\nThis was a crazy year for everyone. Regardless of that, the org admins stepped up and took responsibility for students and mentors involved in the project, with a serious time commitment.\nNot all work by the organizers is publicly visible (applications, project selection, resolving conflicts),\nbut this work is essential to the project’s success.\nThanks a lot to org admins and mentors who helped with the administrative tasks this year!\n\nWhat’s about GSoC 2021?\n\nYes, we plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021.\nThe application period for organizations will start in a few months,\nbut we have already started preparing for the next GSoC session.\nWe are looking for mentors, org admins and project ideas.\nPlease contact us if you are interested!\n\nCall for Mentors and Project Ideas\n\nGSoC 2021 project ideas\n\nHOWTO: Propose a project idea\n\nInformation for mentors : guidelines and expectations\n\nWe invite potential students to start exploring the project and the available project ideas.\nOriginal ideas are always welcome in the project, and starting early is a great opportunity to\nget introduced to the Jenkins community, collect more information about the problem areas,\nand to create a good proposal.\n\"Start early\" is the most popular recommendation from GSoC 2020 participants to future GSoC students,\nand we encourage you to follow this advice!","title":"Google Summer

thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.\n\nElection results:\n\nGavin Mogan and Marky Jackson will join\nKohsuke Kawaguchi, Ullrich Hafner and Oleg Nenashev\non the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nTim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer\n\nMarky Jackson will become the new Events Officer (uncontested)\n\nOlivier Vernin will continue in the role of Infrastructure Officer for another term (uncontested)\n\nDaniel Beck will continue in the role of Security Officer for another term (uncontested)\n\nMark Waite will continue in the role of Documentation Officer for another term (uncontested)\n\nThe board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being,\nand we are excited to see contributors taking these roles.\nIf you are interested to learn more, please see the blog post below.\n\nGovernance Board election details\n\nThis year we had nine candidates participating in Jenkins Governance Board elections:\nAndrey Falko, Ewelina Wilkosz, Frederic Gurr, Gavin Mogan, Justin Harringa,\nMark Waite, Marky Jackson, Steven Terrana, and Zhao Xiaojie (Rick).\nAll of them are awesome community leaders who actively contribute to the Jenkins project and\nrepresent its users.\nIt would be an honor to have them on the Jenkins board.\nRegardless of the election results, we appreciate their participation and the time they invested in these elections.\n\nThis year we were electing 2 governance board members.\nWe were using the Condorcet Internet Voting Service that allows voters to rank their choices rather than just picking their one favorite choice.\nYou can find full voting results here :\n\nMark Waite  (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nMarky Jackson loses to Mark Waite by 48–12\n\nGavin Mogan loses to Mark Waite by 51–10, loses to Marky Jackson by 31–20\n\nEwelina Wilkosz  loses to Mark Waite by 48–14, loses to Gavin Mogan by 29–28\n\nJustin Harringa  loses to Mark

Mark Waite came first in the voting results,\nbeing on the board would violate the Corporate Involvement clause which states that\n\"the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%\".\nMark will continue to be Documentation officer.\nRegardless of his official role, Mark has been leading many initiatives and helping a lot with various aspects of the community governance.\n\nCongratulations to Marky and Gavin, and thanks to all candidates!\nAll new board members are elected for a 2-year term unless they decide to step down earlier.\nThe estimated end of the term for them is December 02, 2022.\nWe would also like to thank Alex Earl and R. Tyler Croy who step down from the Jenkins Governance Board this year.\nThanks to them for all contributions and for continued community leadership.\n\nStatement from Marky Jackson:\n\nIt is a tremendous honor to be elected to this roles. I am so humbled.\nBeing part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.\nMy goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.\nI look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.\n\n— Marky Jackson, Jenkins Governance Board Member and Events Officer\n\nStatement from Gavin Mogan:\n\nGavin here. I’m still in shock that I got voted in for the Jenkins board.\nIt felt like yesterday I just got started helping people randomly on IRC. This is truly exciting.\nI plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.\nThis is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.\nMy specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.\n\n— Gavin Mogan, Jenkins Governance Board Member\n\nOfficer election details\n\nAll 5 officer positions were up for election this year.\nThese roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2021.\nAfter the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,\n4 officer positions were uncontested:\n\nOlivier Vernin - Infrastructure officer.\n\nMarky Jackson - Events officer.\nMarky inherits this role from Alyssa Tong\nwho decided to step down from the officer role and to focus on the Jenkins community marketing,\nincluding Jenkins Is The Way and many other initiatives started by Alyssa.\n\nMark Waite - Documentation officer.\n\nDaniel Beck - Security officer.\n\nThanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!\nOfficers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.\nIt requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.\n\nRelease Officer election results\n\nTim Jacomb won the biggest support as a Release officer ( voting results).\nTim will replace in this role Oliver Gondža\nwho has been leading the Release Team and the release processes since 2016 when the role was officially introduced.\n\nTim Jacomb (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nBaptiste Mathus  loses to Tim Jacomb by 40–23\n\nVictor Martinez  loses to Tim Jacomb by 38–25, loses to Baptiste Mathus by 32–31\n\nHere is a statement from Tim Jacomb:\n\nI’m excited for the year ahead, let’s see where we can take the Jenkins release area in the future.\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation, ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team,\nand ensure that responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.\n\n— Tim Jacomb, Jenkins Release Officer\n\nThanks to Alyssa Tong and Oliver Gondža for their long-time service as Jenkins officers!\nWe are looking to continue working with them in the Jenkins community.\nAnd congratulations to Tim Jacomb and Marky Jackson for joining the team!\n\nStatistics\n\nThis year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.\nIt is significantly lower than in the 2019 elections when we had almost 350 voters.\nIt can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.\nThis year we decided to not use the previous voter registration system,\nand we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.\nThis is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nThe last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.\nWith help of many contributors and with the renewed board,\nwe have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,\nfor example hosting contributor summits,\npublishing the public roadmap,\nCode of Conduct update,\nterminology changes,\nand graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.\nThere is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.\n\nIn short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.\n\nThere are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:\nlong-anticipated features and architecture changes,\nchanging the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process,\ncreating better communication channels with Jenkins users,\nand onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to contribute!\n\nFeedback\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe will appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process so that we can improve the process.\nWe have started a Retrospective document for these elections.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\nThere will be also a public retrospective review at the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meeting on Dec 17.\n\nIf you have any private feedback you would like to share,\nplease send an email to the Jenkins Board.\nIf you would like to raise any issues about the election process,\nplease contact one of the elected Governance Board members.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2020 election

some kind of \"as code\" approach.\nThe experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.\nI consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.\nI appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is.\n\nI am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience\nwith Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.\nEvery day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.\nAs a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.\n\nThanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development\nI had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations\nwhere I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.\nHere are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:\nblogpost,\ncdCON presentation,\npodcast recording.\nSo my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,\nso I actually know what they need and why.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nLinkedIn,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: Eficode (former Praqma)\n\nFrederic Gurr\n\nI started to use Jenkins back in 2008, when it still had a different name.\nIn 2011 I

with the Jenkins community\nkickstarted my interest and involvement with open source software and communities.\n\nI’ve been working as a release engineer at the Eclipse Foundation since 2016,\nsupporting 250+ Jenkins instances for various open source projects.\nI’d be honored to bring a user and admin oriented perspective to the Governance Board and help\nshape the future of Jenkins.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: Eclipse Foundation\n\nGavin Mogan\n\nI got started with Jenkins early on when I was just getting started with testing.\nI knew there had to be a way to run the tests automatically and report on them back to people.\nI started hacking my own tools before I came across Jenkins (then Hudson) and was hooked ever since.\nOver the years I’ve managed to install and configure Jenkins at various jobs,\nand even was employed making internal and external plugins and integrations.\nYou’ll often find me on the Jenkins IRC and Gitter channels as well as the subreddit giving a hand to people who are stuck.\nI also try to get involved with Jenkins Infrastructure projects as much as I can.\nI currently maintain the plugin site, plugin site API, Jenkins Wiki exporter, and a bunch of other minor projects.\nI also help run Vancouver’s chapter of Nodeschool.\n\nIf elected, I would like to address improving commercial support avenues.\nRight now it’s a lot of people flailing in isolation.\nI would like to not only improve things so people can find easier ways to get help,\nbut also encourage more users to help others, and push for a\ncentralized source of companies providing commercial support.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: Digital Ocean, Nodeschool Vancouver\n\nJustin Harringa\n\nThe nomination is quite an honor for me.\nI have been a Hudson/Jenkins user since around 2009/2010 when\nI started working through driving continuous integration in a corporate environment at John Deere.\nAs time went on, I began contributing some small fixes to plugins such as the Job DSL Plugin, OpenID Plugin, and the Workflow Job Plugin.\nEventually, I ended up helping maintain Salesforce’s Chatter plugin and then open sourcing plugins such as the Config-Driven Pipeline Plugin with Andrey Falko.\nMore recently, I have also had the extreme pleasure of mentoring in 2 Jenkins projects for Google Summer of Code\n(Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab in 2019 and Git Plugin Performance Improvements in 2020).\n\nI have learned so much from working with Jenkins and I would love to give back to the

that work, I’ve had the great pleasure of helping to organize the Pipeline Authoring Special Interest Group,\ncontributing to the Jenkins Pipeline documentation, and contributing bug fixes to various plugins\n(including the pipeline plugin and workflow-cps library).\n\nAs a Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador,\nI’ve enjoyed doing what I can to advance the community’s approach to CI/CD and

contributing to Jenkins for so long that it is difficult for me to check when it started exactly.\nMy first pull-request to Jenkins was in 2011 and I had started to use it long before it.\nThroughout the years, I have contributed to various areas:\ncreated our local Jenkins Area Meetup with Michaël Pailloncy,\nhelped users and developers on our mailing lists and IRC channels,\ncontributed to the Jenkins infrastructure, the website,\nprocessing plugins hosting requests, worked full time on Jenkins Evergreen,\nand I am still present today.\n\nFor all these reasons, it would be an honor to serve

the components I maintain when I have time: Slack, Azure Key Vault, Junit,\nmost of the Database plugins, Dark theme, Plugin installation manager, Jenkins Helm chart, Configuration as code plugin.\nI am also a member of the Jenkins infrastructure team,\nand I was involved in the release automation project and the mirrors modernisation effort,\nalong with the day to day support helping people regain access to accounts etc.\n\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation,\nease onboarding of new contributors to the release team, and ensure that\nresponsibilities rotate among

such as\nDevOps World 2020 and\nJenkins World 2017.\n\nI’ve been happily nominated for the Release officer role which matches not just my area of professional expertise that\nI’ve been doing for the last 14 years in different roles for different companies but also that’s an area of personal interest\nwhere I’d like to spend time with the Jenkins community to understand, document and automate the process\nin a way we can keep the project sustainable for a long term as it’s today,\nit’s not just about what I can bring for the community but also about growing together.\n\nIf elected as a Release

reporters, maintainers, and the Jenkins security team to deliver security fixes.\nBeyond that, I regularly contribute to Jenkins and project infrastructure.\n\nSince I’ve started in the Security Officer role, we’ve made significant\nimprovements:\nPlugins no longer allow ordinary users to run arbitrary scripts (no sandbox!) as a regular feature. I introduced fine-grained permission management\nfor our GitHub repositories and\nthe Maven repository hosting our releases.\nWarnings directly in Jenkins inform admins when an installed component has known security issues (and their UX was improved earlier this year).\nThe Jenkins project is now a CVE Numbers Authority,\nto ensure timely and high-quality information in the CVE vulnerability database.\nWorking with Tyler, I added telemetry to Jenkins,\nwhich allowed us to deliver multiple large-scale security fixes with\nminimal impact.\nMore recently, I’ve started writing code scanning rules for common problems in Jenkins and\ninvited maintainers to sign their plugins up,\nwhich is something I hope to properly publish and roll out more widely soon.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nEvents Officer -

uncontested\n\nOlivier Vernin\n\nI have been actively contributing to the Jenkins project for the past four years with contributions across many areas,\nand infrastructure is one of my favorite topics.\nOver my previous mandate as a Jenkins infrastructure officer, I focused on improving contribution experience,\nand let community members opportunities to take ownership of the different services.\nI worked on various sponsoring initiatives to make the Jenkins infrastructure more sustainable.\nWe provided a new environment for releasing Jenkins core (and one plugin!), and also many more things.\n\nFor the coming year, It is hard to make commitments on what it will look like as we have things we know,\nlike services that need some attention (“ci.jenkins.io/) and the things we don’t know yet.\nAnyway, It’s important to me to have a transparent project where everybody could read, learn, participate,\nand understand how the Jenkins project manages infrastructure and I want to continue down that path.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nDocumentation Officer - uncontested\n\nMark Waite\n\nI’m a Jenkins contributor, a member of the Jenkins core team, one of the leaders of the Platform Special Interest Group,\nand leader of the Documentation Special Interest Group.\nI’ve served as the Jenkins Documentation Officer since 2019.\nI was a mentor for Google Season of Code 2020 and am one of the maintainers of the Git plugin for Jenkins.\n\nIf elected and allowed to serve as Documentation Officer,\nI’ll continue efforts to invite more contributors through regular Documentation Office Hours and outreach programs like Google Season of Docs, CommunityBridge, Outreachy, and Jenkins Hackfests.\nI’ll work to assure an inviting and welcoming environment for contributors.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nLinkedIn,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nMore information\n\nJenkins 2020 elections announcement\n\nJenkins Governance Board and Jenkins Officers\n\nJenkins Board and Officer Election Process\n\n2019 election results\n\nElections coordination in the mailing list","title":"2020 Elections: Governance Board and Officer candidates","tags":["community","governance","governance-board","elections"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/author/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ce6df408-6cd5-5276-88d1-f05a7d26b213","slug":"/blog/2020/09/24/board-elections/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins 2020 Elections are over, thanks to all participants!\nPlease see the results announcement.\n\nWe are happy to announce the 2020 elections in the Jenkins project!\nNominations are open for two governance board and for all five officer positions,\nnamely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation.\nThe board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being.\nWe invite Jenkins contributors and community members to sign-up for elections and to nominate contributors for the elected roles.\nDeadline for nominations is Oct 15, voter registration ends on Nov 02.\n\nThese are the second elections held by the Jenkins project.\nDuring the 2019 elections, we elected 3 board members and 5 officers.\nYou can find the voting results here.\nThis year, we decided to make a few changes in the election process based on the 2019 elections feedback.\n\nKey dates\n\nSep 24 -

are happy to announce that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in\nthe Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).\nThis status is officially effective Aug 03, 2020.\nJenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.\nThanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!\n\nIn this article, we will discuss what the CD Foundation membership and graduation mean to the Jenkins community.\nWe will also talk about what changed in Jenkins as a part of the graduation,\nand what are the future steps for the project.\n\nTo know more about the Jenkins graduation,\nsee also the announcement on the CD Foundation website.\nAlso see the special edition of the CD Foundation Newsletter for Jenkins user success stories and some surprise content.\nThe press release is available here.\n\nHow does CDF membership help us?\n\nAbout 18 months ago, Jenkins became one of the CDF founding projects, along with Jenkins X, Spinnaker and Tekton.\nA new foundation was formed to provide a vendor-neutral home for open source projects used for Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration.\nSpecial interest groups were started to foster collaboration between projects and end user companies,\nmost notably:\nInteroperability,\nMLOps and\nSecurity SIGs.\nAlso, a Community Ambassador role was created to organize local meetups and to provide public-facing community representatives.\nMany former Jenkins Ambassadors and other contributors are now CDF Ambassadors, and they promote Jenkins and other projects there.\n\nThanks to this membership we addressed key project infrastructure needs.\nStarting from Jan 2020, CDF covers a significant part of the infrastructure costs\nincluding our services and CI/CD instances running on Microsoft Azure.\nThe CD Foundation provided us with legal assistance required to get code signing keys for the Jenkins project.\nThanks to that, we were able to switch to a new Jenkins Release Infrastructure.\nThe foundation sponsors the Zoom account we use for Jenkins Online Meetups and community meetings.\nIn the future we will continue to review ways of reducing maintenance overhead by switching some of our self-hosted services to equivalents provided by the Linux Foundation to CDF members.\n\nAnother important CDF membership benefit is community outreach and marketing.\nIt helped us to establish connections with other CI/CD projects and end user companies.\nThrough the foundation we have access to the DevStats service\nthat provides community contribution statistics and helps us track trends and discover areas for improvement.\nOn the marketing side, the foundation organizes webinars, podcasts and newsletters.\nJenkins is regularly represented there.\nThe CD Foundation also runs the meetup.com professional account which is used by local Jenkins communities for\nCI/CD and Jenkins Area Meetups.\nLast but not least, the Jenkins community is also represented at virtual conferences where CDF has a booth.\nAll of that helps to grow Jenkins visibility and to highlight new features and initiatives in the project.\n\nWhy did we graduate?\n\nThe Jenkins project has a long history of open governance which is a key part of today’s project success.\nStarting from 2011, the project has introduced the governance meeting which are open to anyone.\nMost of the discussions and decision making happen publicly in the mailing lists.\nIn 2015 we introduced teams, sub-projects and officer roles.\nIn 2017 we introduced the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process which helped us to make the key architecture and governance decisions more open and transparent to the community and the Jenkins users.\nIn 2018 we introduced special interest groups that focus on community needs.\nIn 2019 we have expanded the Jenkins governance board\nso that it got more bandwidth to facilitate initiatives in the project.\n\nSince the Jenkins project inception 15 years ago, it has been steadily growing.\nNow it has millions of users and thousands of contributors.\nIn 2019 it has seen 5,433 contributors from 111 countries and 272 companies,\n67 core and 2,654 plugin releases,\n45,484 commits, 7,000+ pull requests.\nIn 2020 Q2 the project has seen 21% growth in pull requests numbers compared to 2019 Q2, bots excluded.\n\nOne may say that the Jenkins project already has everything needed to succeed.\nIt is a result of continuous work by many community members,\nand this work will never end as long as the project remains active.\nLike in any other industry, the CI/CD ecosystem changes every day and sets new expectations from the automation tools in this domain.\nJust as the tools evolve, open source communities need to evolve so that they can address expectations, and onboard more users and contributors.\nThe CDF graduation process helped us to discover opportunities for improvement,\nand address them.\nWe reviewed the project processes and compared them with the Graduated Project criteria defined in the CDF project lifecycle.\nBased on this review, we made changes in our processes and documentation.\nIt should improve the experience of Jenkins users,\nand help to make the Jenkins community more welcoming to existing and newcomer contributors.\n\nWhat changed for the project?\n\nBelow you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:\n\nPublic roadmap\n\nWe introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.\nThis roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.\nIt makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters,\nand at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.\nThe roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in jep:14[].\n\nMore details about the public roadmap are coming next week, stay tuned for a separate blogpost.\nOn July 10th we had an online contributor meetup about the roadmap\nand you can find more information in its materials\n( slides, video recording).\n\nUser Documentation\n\nJenkins Weekly Release line is now documented on our website ( here).\nWe have also reworked the downloads page and added guidelines explaining how to verify downloads.\n\nA new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.\nThis list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,\nincluding ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.\nPlease do not hesitate to add your company there!\n\nCommunity\n\nWe passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.\nThis certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices\nand to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).\nIt also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.\nDetails are on the Jenkins core page.\n\nJenkins Code of Conduct was updated\nto the new version of Contributor Covenant.\nIn particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.\n\nThe default Jenkins contributing template was updated to cover more common cases for plugin contributors.\nThis page provides links to the Participate and Contribute guidelines hosted on our website,\nand helps potential contributors to easily access the documentation.\n\nThe Jenkins Core maintainer guide was updated to include maintenance and issues triage guidelines.\nIt should help us to deliver quality releases and to timely triage and address issues reported by Jenkins users.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIt an honor to be the first project to reach the graduated stage in the Continuous Delivery Foundation,\nbut it is also a great responsibility for the project.\nAs a project, we plan to continue participating in the CDF activities and to work with other projects and end users to maintain the Jenkins' leader role in the CI/CD space.\n\nWe encourage everyone to join the project and participate in evolving the Jenkins project and driving its roadmap.\nIt does not necessarily mean committing code or documentation patches;\nuser feedback is also very important to the project.\nIf you are interested to contribute or to share your feedback,\nplease contact us in the Jenkins community channels ( mailing lists, chats)!\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nCDF graduation work was a major effort in the Jenkins community.\nCongratulations and
