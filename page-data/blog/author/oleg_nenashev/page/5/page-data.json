If you use configuration management for Jenkins\nagents, please read this announcement carefully.\n\nIf you have ever seen messages like \"Channel is already closed\" or \"Remote call failed\" in your build logs,\nyou have already met Jenkins Remoting.\n\nRemoting is an agent executable and a library implementing the communication layer between Jenkins controllers and their agents (including communication protocols, distributed calls and classloading).\nIt is also used in several other cases: Maven Integration Plugin, Remoting-based CLI, etc.\n\nIn order to make it clear what’s changing in Jenkins Remoting, I have documented the various components on\nthe Remoting’s sub-project page, and will try to publish regular updates about the status of\nRemoting to this site and the developer mailing list.\n\nIn this post I would like to provide an update on the Remoting roadmap and to announce two major incoming changes: deprecation of old protocols and upgrade to Java 8.\nBoth changes will take place in one of the next Weekly releases.\nETA is Jenkins 2.75 on Aug 20, 2017.\n\nBelow are details on the incoming changes and compatibility notes.\n\nOld Remoting Protocols Deprecation\n\nIt has been almost one year since the release of JNLP4-connect protocol in Remoting 3.0.\nThis protocol has been enabled by default since 2.46.x, and so far it demonstrates good stability being compared to JNLP2 and JNLP3 protocols.\n\nAt the governance meeting\nwe decided to disable old Remoting protocols (JNLP/JNLP2 + CLI1) in new installations by default.\nThere are 3 reasons for it:\n\nMaintenance of multiple protocols takes a lot of extra effort.\nThe JNL2 NIO engine is complex and barely diagnosable.\n\nThere are known issues in JNLP2 connection management (see the protocol’s Errata). In many cases update to JNLP4 was a resolution\n\nJNLP1/JNLP2/CLI1 are unencrypted, and it is not something Jenkins users may expect in 2017\n\nIt is tracked as JENKINS-45841 in Jenkins JIRA.\n\nHow?\n\nWhen Jenkins is started in the new installation mode with enabled Installation Wizard, old protocols will be disabled\n\nJenkins shows an administrative warning when obsolete protocols are enabled\n\nCompatibility notes\n\nOlder instances won’t be affected by the disabling of the older JNLP1/JNLP2 protocols, which will still be enabled for them.\nNewly created instances which skip, or disable, the Setup Wizard will not be affected either.\n\n\"New\" Jenkins instances installed via setup wizard may be affected in edge cases. For example:\n\nAgents with Remoting older than 3.0 will be unable to connect.\n\nMitigation: Before updating make sure Remoting is not bundled custom Docker images, AMIs, etc.\n\nSwarm Plugin: old versions of Swarm Client (before 3.3) will be unable to connect to Jenkins, because Remoting 2.x is bundled\n\nMitigation : Update Swarm Client\n\nVery old jenkins-cli.jar without CLI2 support will be unable to connect.\n\nMitigation : Do not use Remoting-based CLI on new instances (see this blogpost)\n\nUpgrade to Java 8\n\nStarting with version 2.54, Jenkins requires Java 8 to run\n( announcement blog post).\nThis version is also required for Jenkins LTS 2.60.1.\n\nRemoting continued to support Java 7 for a while for backporting purposes,\nbut it will be also upgraded to Java 8 in the Remoting 3.11 release.\nThis Rremoting version is expected to be available in Jenkins 2.75 (ETA: Aug 20, 2017).\nThis change is tracked as JENKINS-43985.\n\nCompatibility notes\n\nThe update does not cause compatibility issues in common use-cases.\nHowever, there may be issues in custom Jenkins core builds and packaging.\nThere are several examples below.\n\nJenkins instances with built-in Remoting versions will NOT be affected, Java 8 is already required there\n\nUsers of community-provided Docker packages ( docker-agent,\ndocker-inbound-agent) will NOT be affected,\nJava 8 is already required there\n\nCustom Jenkins WAR file builds targeting Java 7 may fail to build/run if they bundle Remoting 3.11 or later\n\nCustom Jenkins agent instances (manually installed hosts, VM snapshots, Docker packages, AMIs, etc.) may fail if they download the latest Remoting version and use Java 7\n\nJava 9 support\n\nAs with Jenkins core, Java 9 not supported and not tested in Remoting.\nIt may work in some configurations, but it is not guaranteed.\n\nAs a consequence, it is not recommended to run Remoting with Java 9 right now.\nIt is also not recommended to use Maven Integration Plugin to run builds on Java 9.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThere are some ongoing activities in the Remoting sub-project:\n\nStability and Diagnosability improvements\n( JENKINS-38833)\n\nWhy? When it comes to Remoting issues, it is really hard to diagnose them\n\nRecently I have published some slides about preventing and diagnosing issues, but I want the behavior to be more stable by default\n\nThis Epic lists my plans about Remoting issues and papercuts I would like to fix this year\n\nRemoting Work Directories\n( JENKINS-44108)\n\nFor a long time logging was disabled by default in Java Web Start (JNLP) and SSH agents, because Remoting had no option to determine where to store such data before connecting to the controller\n\nThe new Remoting Work Directory feature (since Remoting 3.8) offers such storage, which is also used for storing JAR caches and for checking workspace writeability before accepting builds.\n\nThis Epic is about enabling Remoting work directories by default in common Agent launcher types.\n\nRemoting Upgradeability\n( JENKINS-44099)\n\nRight now Remoting is not being upgraded automatically on JNLP agents, it is supported only for Windows service agents starting from Jenkins 2.50\n\nOn the Jenkins controller side it is required to upgrade the Jenkins core in order to pick Remoting fixes.\n\nThis Epic aims simplifying the upgrade procedure for most common cases.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to these tasks, or others in the Remoting\nsub-project, please feel free to reach out via the issue tracker or\n#jenkins IRC channel.\n\nIf you are coming to Jenkins World, you can also find me at the \"Ask the Experts\" booth there.\nSee more info about Ask the Experts here.\n\nUseful links\n\nRemoting Sub-Project on Jenkins website\n\nRemoting Release Notes\n\nRemoting documentation on GitHub\n\nMy slides about Remoting issues troubleshooting","title":"Remoting Update.
