is not glamorous, but it is goodness.\n\n— Thomas Otter\n\nJenkins technical documentation is an important part of our project as it is key to using Jenkins well.\nGood documentation guides users and encourages good implementation choices.\nIt is a crucial part of the user experience.\n\nIn the recent Jenkins UI/UX hackfest, documentation was a specific track to improve the Jenkins user experience.\nWe received many improvements from experienced Jenkins contributors and newcomers alike.\nContributors from all around the world submitted pull requests for documentation on installing, managing, administering, and operating Jenkins.\n\nDocumentation migration from Wiki\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki pages have collected 15 years of experience and wisdom for Jenkins users.\nHowever, that experience and wisdom is intermixed with inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated information.\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki migration project identified the 50 most accessed pages on the Jenkins wiki and created GitHub issues to track the migration of those pages to www.jenkins.io.\nThis was our first large scale experiment using GitHub issues for documentation.\nThe results have been overwhelmingly positive.\nHackfest contributors added new sections to many documentation chapters, including:\n\nUsing Jenkins\n\nPipeline\n\nManaging Jenkins\n\nSystem Administration\n\nThe Hackfest closed 19 of the wiki migration issues.\nWork is in progress on an additional 25 wiki migration issues.\nWe’ve made great progress and look forward to even better results in the future.\nNew contributors used the \"good first issue\" label very effectively.\nWe started the Hackfest with most of the 25 \"good first issues\" unassigned and completed the Hackfest with 14 closed and 10 others in progress.\nWe’ll provide more \"good first issues\" as we use the Jenkins Wiki migration to welcome new documentation contributors.\n\nMigrating plugin documentation\n\nPlugin documentation is also in transition.\nSince November 2019, plugins have been moving their documentation into the GitHub repository that hosts the plugin source code.\nThis\"documentation as code\" approach allows plugin maintainers to include documentation improvements in the same pull requests that implement new capabilities.\nIt assures that documentation changes are reviewed by the same maintainers who review and approve new capabilities.\n\nHackfest participants submitted pull requests to migrate plugin documentation to GitHub.\n10 plugin pull requests are in progress from the Hackfest.\n5 plugin pull requests from the Hackfest have been already merged and are awaiting the release of the plugin.\n\nChuck Norris uses documentation as code\n\nIn the spirit of fun and adventure, Oleg Nenashev migrated the \"Chuck Norris plugin\" to GitHub documentation as code in a live Hackfest presentation May 26, 2020.\nLinks to the recording, the plugin migration guide, and the export tool are available from\"Migrating plugins to documentation-as-code\".\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nJenkins works with other technologies to solve automation challenges in many different environments.\nWe describe those environments in our\"Solution Pages\".\nAs part of the Hackfest, we’ve started a series of improvements to the solution pages.\n\nThe Docker solutions page now includes updated videos and a better page layout for easier reading and better navigation.\nOther solution pages will receive similar improvements in the future.\n\nSystem properties\n\nThe global configuration of Jenkins can be modified at startup by defining Java properties.\nSystem properties can change system defaults and can provide compatibility \"escape hatches\" when a new default configuration might be incompatible with existing installations.\n\nDaniel Beck has improved the navigation and user experience of the system properties page as part of the Hackfest.\nIt is now much easier to read and to reference, with embeddable links available with a mouse-over to the right of every property and labels that categorize and classify each property.\n\nPlugin site improvements\n\nDuring the Hackfest, Gavin Mogan has continued his efforts to improve the Jenkins Plugins Site so that users can easily access plugin changelogs and reported issues.\nOnce this pull request is merged, it will greatly improve the experience of those Jenkins users who want to update plugins and look for documentation about what has changed in them and what are the possible issues they might experience.\n\nExample of the incoming UI for the Jira plugin:\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThere is still much to do in Jenkins documentation and we need your help to do it.\nThere are many ways to participate in the Jenkins project, including documentation.\nSee the contributing guidelines for detailed instructions.\nJoin the documentation chat for personalized help and encouragement.\n\nThe Jenkins project has been also accepted to Google Season of Docs this year.\nThis open-source mentorship program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nWe are looking for technical writers who are interested to contribute to the project in September-December 2020.\nIt is a great opportunity to study Documentation-as-code tools and to learn more about contributing to open-source projects.\nYou can find Jenkins project ideas and more information here.","title":"Jenkins User Experience Hackfest Documentation

Jenkins community is conducting the 2019 elections for Board and Officer positions.\nThe call for nominations has concluded.\nWe received many nominations.\nBased on the people who are willing to accept their nomination and the uncontested officer positions, we will have 3 votes:\n\nA vote to elect 3 board members\n\nA vote to elect the Jenkins security officer\n\nA vote to elect the Jenkins events officer\n\nCandidates\n\nEach candidate has provided a statement to help guide voters on why they should vote for the candidate.\nRefer to the candidate statements for more details.\nThe candidates running for a board position are:\n\nAlex Earl\n\nOliver Gondza\n\nUllrich Hafner\n\nOleg Nenashev\n\nMark Waite\n\nZhao Xiaojie (a.k.a. Rick to many of you)\n\nThe candidates running for Security Officer are:\n\nDaniel Beck\n\nWadeck Follonier\n\nThe candidates running for Events Officer are:\n\nAlyssa Tong\n\nZhao Xiaojie (a.k.a. Rick to many of you)\n\nVoter Registration\n\nThis is the first time in a while that we are running a Jenkins election; we are learning as we go.\nJenkins elections aim to be very inclusive.\nWe do not restrict elections to just code committers.\nAnyone who has a Jenkins account registered before September 1, 2019 is eligible to vote.\nJenkins, being the successful project it is, has  approximately 100 000 accounts that meet that criteria.\nAs a result we are contacting eligible voters and requesting that they explicitly ‘opt-in’ to participate in the voting.\n\nIf you meet the criteria, you will receive an email at your registered jenkins.io email address.\nIt will be from elections@jenkins.io with the title ‘ 2019 Jenkins Election - Invitation to Participate ’.\nThe email will provide election details and will include an \" I want to participate\" button.\n\nVoter Confirmation\n\nOnce you click on the link, you should see a confirmation screen as follows:\n\nIf you do not receive the email by November 14, 2019 or if you have any problems voting, please comment on the Jenkins Election 2019 Jira issue.\n\nVoting\n\nThe voting will officially open on November 11, 2019.\nCandidates will receive an email from the Condorcet internet voting sent by Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\nOne email will be sent for each vote (so 3 in total: 1 for board, 1 for event officer and 1 for security officer).\nThe vote will ask to rank the candidates using a screen like this:\n\nElection Dates\n\nHere is a summary of the key election dates:\n\nDate\nEvent\n\nNow\nVoter registration ongoing\n\nNov 11, 2019\nVoting begins\n\nNov 17, 2019\nVoter registration closes\n\nNov 24, 2019\nVoting closes a 5:00 PM Pacific Time\n\nDec 3, 2019\nNew representatives announced\n\nElection results will be posted to the Jenkins developer mailing list, followed by an announcement blog post on jenkins.io.\n\nIf there are any delays to the proposed dates we will aim to communicate that as soon as we can.\nThank you very much for all the candidates showing the Jenkins spirit of service to their community.\nWe encourage everyone to register to vote and participate in the Jenkins community.\n\nUncontested Officer Positions\n\nWhen an officer position has only one candidate that is willing to accept the nomination, there is no reason to vote on that position.\nThe individual becomes an officer as the sole candidate for the position.\n\nUncontested officers include:\n\nName\nRole\n\nOlivier Vernin\nInfrastructure Officer\n\nOliver Gondza\nRelease Officer\n\nMark Waite\nDocumentation Officer\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\nAnnouncement in the developer mailing list\n\n2019 elections proposal in

Jenkins Contributor summit is where the current and future contributors of the Jenkins project get together.\nThis summit will be on Tuesday, October 23rd 2018 in Nice, France just before Jenkins World.\nWhat should those planning on joining expect at the event?\nEarlier this year in September we had a contributor summit in San Francisco which gave us a pretty good outline of what to expect.\nFirst of all it was one of the biggest contributor summits ever with lots of first-time attendees.\n\nMorning\n\nThere are plenty of exciting developments happening in the Jenkins community, which meant there was a packed program.\nOne of the most anticipated updates was Kohsuke Kawaguchi speaking about Jenkins Shifting Gears.\n\nThere were also updates on the '5 Jenkins Superpower' projects in active development:\n\nJenkins Evergreen\n\nJenkins X\n\nConfiguration as Code\n\nJenkins Pipeline\n\nCloud Native Jenkins\n\nAs ever Jenkins is a community driven by its members so it was also great to get an update on Google Summer of Code.\n\nBirds-of-a-feather (BoF)\n\nAfter a packed morning of updates, it was time for a break and some lunch.\nAfter lunch attendees divided up into groups and gathered around tables for unconference style discussions of specific areas.\nEach table ran differently: some had demos, some did presentations, some hacked on code and others brainstormed ideas.\nThere was definitely alot of energy in the room and huge exchange of ideas.\n\nIgnite Talks & Wrap-up\n\nTo finish off the session we had a set of ignite talks.\nAttendees were invited to volunteer on the day - no easy task given the pressure involved- and many did.\nHats off to Liam Newman, Mandy Hubbard, Eric Smalling, Pui Chee Chan, Martin d’Anjou and Vishal Raina for getting out of their comfort zone and doing talks.\nThere were two surprise ignite talks, one for James Strachan and one for Kohsuke Kawaguchi which were highly entertaining gave the audience lots of laughs.\nSomeone even captured KK’s talk on video.  The sound isn’t great but it was a truly visionary talk:\n\nFinally the event finished with swag presentations and a fun Kahoot quiz to wrap things up.\n\nContributor Appreciation Event\n\nAfter the summit, contributors were invited to join at the after party at Spin.\nSpin was a unique venue in San Francisco where attendees could socialise and also play ping-pong!\nWhile some took it seriously most enjoyed the relaxed way to get to know their fellow contributors.\n\nSee you in Nice\n\nThe event was a lot of fun and the contributor summit in Nice will follow a very similar structure.\nAll levels of contributor are welcome, there will be lots of opportunity for in-depth discussions and you can even do an ignite talk!\nWhile we won’t be repeating the ping pong event there will be something equally unique to follow on from the summit.\n\nAttending is free, and no DevOps World | Jenkins World ticket is needed, but RSVP if you are going to attend to help us plan.\nSee you there!\n\nAs long as you’re in Nice for the Contributor Summit,\njoin Tracy, Kohsuke, and hundreds of other Jenkins users at\nDevOps World - Jenkins World on October 22-25.\nRegister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"What to Expect at the Jenkins Contributor

is talking about serverless.\n\nAs with any new hyped-technology the term 'serverless' is often overloaded with different meanings.\nSometimes serverless is oversimplified to mean function-as-a-service(faas).\nBut there is more to it than that.\nAlso, not many people are talking about doing CI/CD with serverless,\neven though where there is code there still in need of continuous integration and continuous delivery.\nSo I was excited to hear about this talk by\nAnubhav Mishra on\nBuilding a CI/CD Pipeline for Serverless Applications.\n\nIn the talk Anubhav proposes a new definition for serverless:\n\n\"\"\nServerless is a technology pattern that provides services and concepts to minimize operational overhead that comes with managing servers.\nIt is a powerful abstraction when used can result in an increased focus on business value.\n\"\"\n\nThe talk then goes on to demo Jenkins on AWS Fargate (a platform for running containers without managing servers or clusters).\nThe main focus is on increased elasticity/scaling.\n\nThe advantages of this approach are:\n\nNo nodes/servers to manage\n\nLaunch 10,000+ builds/containers in seconds\n\nNo cost for idle time\n\nThe real headline is the cost saving, which is 2 orders of magnitude better with serverless.\nA cost comparison is done based on 1 vCPU & 2GB memory:\n\nWith Jenkins on Fargate: 100 builds * 5 mins = $0.633/month\n\nWith Jenkins on EC2 Instances: ~50/month\n\nThis huge potential cost saving is one of the things that makes serverless incredibly compelling.\nNot to mention you don’t have to think much upfront about scaling the system.\n\nBut there are drawbacks with this approach, noted as:\n\nCold starts - slower boot times for clients\n\nLarge container images (~1G)\n\nNo root access\n\nEphemeral storage (default)\n\nThis is an area where Jenkins can continue to evolve to make the most of serverless architectures.\nI highly recommend you check out the\nslides for yourself.\nThe best part is that, in the true spirit of open source, Anubvha shared the code\nhere.\nSo you can give it a try yourself and build your own serverless CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.","title":"Building a Serverless CI/CD Pipeline with

week I participated in the\nJenkins & Java 10 Online Hackathon.\nIt was my first Jenkins hackathon and I roped in\nJonah Graham to do some pair-programming.\nThe hackathon featured JDK Project Jigsaw committers Mandy Chung and Paul Sandoz,\nas well as Jenkins creator Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\nIt was a great opportunity for me to learn a lot about Jenkins and Java 10.\n\nWhy Java 10?\n\nWith the\nJava 8 EoL data looming,\nthe focus was on the current available version of Java, Java 10.\nJava 10 offers some nice new features and APIs, not least\nimproved docker container integration.\nWe learned from Paul of a number of projects with Java 10 migration success stories including Elasticsearch, Kafka & Netty.\n\nAt the beginning of the hackathon week, the Jenkins Pipeline feature would crash out when using Java 10.\nThis was resolved with a number of fixes including the upgrade of the\nASM library.\nThen it was nice to see things\nup and running with Java 10.\n\nGetting up & running\n\nThe first steps were to do some exploratory testing using\nJenkins with Java 10 via Docker, thanks to\nOleg for providing clear instructions.\nThis was boringly straightforward as most things worked and we only found one\nissue to report.\nNext to try to get some patches in, we needed to set-up a dev environment.\nThe live session gave us what we needed to set up a\nplugin or\ncore dev environment.\nOne open question we had was whether Jenkins has semantic versioning and\nAPI tools\nto help identify when you might be breaking backwards compatibility.\nOverall it was straightforward to get a dev environment up and running.\n\nJava 10 New APIs\n\nThe next step was to find an issue which we could help resolve.\nMany of the Java 10 issues were related to 'Illegal reflective access' from various plugins or third-party libraries.\nHowever after investigating a couple, removing these warnings required a good architectural knowledge of the plugin or core code itself.\nIn the end we decided that messing around with classloaders or attempting to upgrade version of jdom was not one for the newbies.\n\nInstead we looked at\nremoving reflection\nin cases of isAccessible calls.\nWe found the\nProcessHandle\napi very useful and a good replacement for some misuse of reflection, and even better it made the code work on Windows too.\nMandy also pointed us to look at the\nLookup api\nas possible alternate to findClass calls.\n\nMulti-Release JAR Builds\n\nUsing new APIs is all well and good but presents a problem when you want to maintain backwards compatibility with Java 8.\nHence the need for some sort of multi-jar solution -\nNicolas De loof proposed one such solution for\nmulti-release jars with Maven for this case.\n\nsun.misc.Signal\n\nThe Java Signal API is being deprecated, but so far no replacement APIs\nare available for signal handling.\nJenkins makes use of the Signal APIs so a big question for the Jigsaw team was whether this would be replaced going forward.\nKohsuke pointed out how it is important for Java to maintain this UNIX like behaviour as it shouldn’t matter to end users that Jenkins is written in Java.\nIt seems these APIs will be replaced in due course, they just\naren’t there right now.\n\nCollaboration, Collaboration, Collaboration\n\nIt was great to have the discussions with the Jigsaw team.\nThey reminded us how they need to know the Java use cases out there and how their team uses these to feed into their development process.\nIn turn, the hackathon had Jenkins community members participate, for instance\neasy-jenkins was up and running with Java 10 by the end of the week.\nThe hackathon had a great feeling of community spirit and was a reminder why collaborations with communities and also between different communities can be powerful and fun for all involved.\n\nAt the end of the week Jonah and I were both happy that we made our first Jenkins contributions (which were reviewed and merged quickly).\nThanks to all who participated and made it highly enjoyable, especially Oleg for great organization.\nI look forward to the next one!","title":"What I learned from the Jenkins & Java 10+

Tracy Miranda, and I’m really excited to have joined CloudBees this month leading the open source program. CloudBees’ contributions to Jenkins include developing Pipeline and Blue Ocean, staffing the infrastructure team, advocacy and events work, as well as security efforts. My focus is on making sure there is a great relationship between the Jenkins community and CloudBees, which means strong communication, help get traction on things the community wants, and generally working to make Jenkins and the community thrive and stay awesome in an ever-changing tech landscape.\n\nHere’s a little background on me: I come from an electronics/EDA background but switched to software early in my career when I first got involved with open source software. I’ve been part of the Eclipse community for around 15 years, definitely from before git was even a thing. I love being involved with all levels: project committer, conference chair, steering committee for working groups and more recently board of directors.\n\nOn a personal note, I …\n\nLive in the UK with my husband and 2 young kids\n\nGrew up in Kenya\n\nEnjoy playing badminton, love good food & am always first at any buffets\n\nI am looking forward to getting to know the Jenkins community well, and really getting a feel for your Jenkins stories, good and bad. Please feel free to let me know:\n\nWhat you love about the Jenkins community & how you are using Jenkins\n\nWhat you’re working on doing with Jenkins\n\nWhat you don’t like and want improved\n\nYou can find me on the mailing lists or via:\n\nTwitter @tracymiranda\n\nEmail: tmiranda@cloudbees.com\n\nIRC: tracymiranda\n\nAlso I’ll be at the upcoming events: DevOps World - Jenkins World in San Francisco, California and Nice, France so if you plan to attend do come and say hi. The Jenkins community is the real force behind Jenkins. And in turn Jenkins powers so much of the software out there.
