year, news of compromised passwords being used for accounts able to distribute NPM packages made the rounds.\n\nTheir system looks similar to how publishing of plugins works in the Jenkins project:\n\nAccounts are protected by passwords chosen by users.\n\nIndividual contributors have permission to release the components they maintain.\n\nThe components they release are used by millions of developers around the world to deliver their software.\n\nIn other words, weak passwords are a problem for us just as much as for NPM, and what happened to them could happen to us.\n\nTo address this problem, the Jenkins security and infra teams have recently collaborated on a password audit.\nThe audit covered all accounts with permissions to upload plugins and components, and on accounts with other levels of privileged infrastructure access.\nWe ran brute force tools on salted password hashes of those accounts looking for \"weak\" passwords — passwords present in a set of publicly available password lists we chose for this audit.\n\nWe checked the password of every qualifying account for every unsafe password rather than trying to match them to any previous password leaks' email/password pairs.\nUsers with weak account passwords were notified via email a few weeks ago and were asked to change their password to something stronger.\n\nWe performed the same checks over the previous weekend, but this time we only checked the passwords of accounts whose passwords were deemed weak during our first check.\nWe then invalidated the password of any account whose password was still not considered \"strong\" (i.e. their password was unchanged or had been changed to another weak password).\nUsers of those accounts will need to request a password reset before signing in again.\n\nWe plan to implement further safeguards, including improving the account management app at https://accounts.jenkins.io to reject weak passwords.\nIf you’re interested in helping the security team make Jenkins more secure, let us know on the jenkinsci-dev mailing list, or request to join the security team.","title":"Jenkins community account password

just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.95 and 2.89.2, that fix two security vulnerabilities.\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\n\nWe usually announce core security updates well in advance on the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list, to give Jenkins administrators time to schedule a maintenance.\nAdditionally, we try to align security updates with the regular LTS schedule.\nWe have chosen not to do so in this case for two reasons:\n\nThe random failure to set up Jenkins is very noticeable, and given that we’ve seen automated exploits for unprotected Jenkins instances in the past we consider it important to fix that issue as soon as possible, so that users setting up new instances of Jenkins can be confident they won’t start up insecurely.\n\nThe CSRF issue appears to only affect instances for a very short (seconds at most, if at all) time period immediately after startup, so administrators could apply the fix during the next scheduled Jenkins downtime, rather than immediately.","title":"Security updates for Jenkins
