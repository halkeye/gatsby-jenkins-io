However, most miss the opportunity to gain real insights into their build and release pipeline.  I’ll show you how you can increase observability by activating metric capture and analysis during a containerized application deployment with Jenkins X.  This  entails modifying the declarative Tekton pipelines.\n\n12:40 - 12:55pm\tFrom setup to build status on the command line Martin d’Anjou\n\nUsing bash, groovy, JCasC and the jenkins-rest, we demonstrate how to setup Jenkins from scratch, upload a configuration as code yaml file, create folders and jobs, run a build, and track it to its completion, all from the command line, without ever touching the GUI.\n\n12:55 - 1:10pm\t\tDevOps without Quality: An IT Horror Story\tLaura Keaton\n\nDevOps, the current IT Industry sweetheart, has a dark secret that has victimized organizations on their transformational journey.

From Jenkins users, to maintainers, contributors, mentors and those new to Jenkins this event will have something for everyone.\n\nThis year’s DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco has moved to a larger venue to facilitate the growth. From August 12 - 15, 2019 the event will take place at the Moscone West Center.  The event boasts 100+ sessions, and will offer training, hands-on workshops, onsite certification, contributor summit and much more.  Conference attendees can expect to be inspired while learning the latest innovations from industry leaders. Attendees will learn the value that digital transformation has in delivering software more efficiently, more quickly and with higher quality.\n\nWe are excited to announce most of the agenda for DevOps World Jenkins World San Francisco is now live. We will continue to fill out the agenda with more sessions, trainings/workshops, and activities. Below is a small sampling of sessions from some of our favorite Jenkins contributors:\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code: try it & start contributing! - Ewelina Wilkosz\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code is an open source Jenkins plugin that allows users to keep complete Jenkins configuration in a simple configuration file (yaml format). In the talk, I’ll briefly present the history of the plugin, the vision for the future and current status. Then I’ll move to the demo section where I’ll show how easy it is to configure and run Jenkins with the help of the plugin.\n\nThinking about Jenkins Security - Mark Waite & Wadeck Follonier\n\nJenkins security concepts, authorization, authentication and auditing, secure builds, agent security, configuration and administration security, auditing, and security best practices.\n\nDocker and Jenkins [as Code] - Dr. Oleg Nenashev\n\nThe Configuration as Code plugin is a new milestone which enables managing Jenkins configurations via YAML. Together with Docker, this plugin offers many ways to produce ready-to-fly Jenkins images for any environments. In my talk, I will describe official controller and agent images offered by the Jenkins project. What’s inside them? How do you configure images with JCasC and Groovy hooks? How do you use these approaches together? And, finally, how do you simplify packaging of custom Jenkins images and define the entire system [as code]?\n\nCan Jenkins be the Engine of Mobile DevOps? - Shashikant Jagtap\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the following topics:\n\nHow mobile DevOps is different than web DevOps\n\nChallenges in mobile DevOps ( iOS and Android)\n\nHow Jenkins fits in mobile DevOps and CI/CD pipelines\n\nWhat Jenkins misses for mobile\n\nHow we can make Jenkins better for mobile apps\n\nCreating a CI/CD Pipeline for Your Shared Libraries - Roderick Randolph\n\nAt Capital One we run tens of thousands of CI/CD pipelines on Jenkins, leveraging the Jenkins Pipeline shared libraries extension to enable code reuse and decrease time to market for dev teams. A code change to our shared library goes live immediately and is consumed the next time a team triggers their project’s pipeline. So, why do we have such high confidence that a code change to our library won’t break a team’s pipeline? The answer: we’ve developed a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for our shared library.\n\nDuring this talk, you will learn how to create a fully automated pipeline for your shared libraries including how to develop tests, create canary releases, monitor for issues and quickly rollback changes to your shared library to achieve rapid delivery while minimizing any impact on dev teams.\n\nHow Jenkins Builds and Delivers Jenkins in the Cloud - Brian Benz & Tyler Croy\n\nWant to know how Jenkins builds Jenkins? Catch this session to see the real-life implementation of Jenkins’ development (at ci.jenkins.io) and delivery infrastructure in the cloud as it evolved from a mix of platforms to multi-platform VMs, containers and Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure.  Expect a frank discussion of issues that were encountered along the way, how the architecture has evolved and what’s on the roadmap.  We’ll share important tips and tricks for implementing your own Jenkins infrastructure on any cloud, based on Jenkins’ own implementation experience.\n\nDeclarative Pipeline 2019: Tips, Tricks and What’s Next - Liam Newman\n\nAre you using Declarative Pipeline? Are you considering using them? Are you just curious? Well, we’re going to help you get more out of Declarative Pipeline with less complexity and less effort. We’ll walk through some best practices, point out some tricks you might not have known, warn you off some common mistakes, review what’s changed in the last year and give you a preview of what we’re working on for Declarative Pipeline going forward.\n\nSay Goodbye to Hello World, Say Hello to Real World Delivery Pipelines - Brian Benz & Jessica Deen\n\nAre you tired of \"Hello World\" and hypothetical demos? So are we! In this code-heavy, deeply technical session, you’ll learn more than just tips and tricks.  You’ll learn best practices and how to start from absolute zero. Whether you’re using Jenkins, Azure DevOps, a mixture of the two, or another CI/CD tool, you’ll learn how to create multiple build and release pipelines using real world code hosted on open source platforms such as GitHub.\n\nFor the complete agenda see DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco .\n\nFeel free to use discount code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.\n\nHope to see you there!","title":"DevOps World-Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco: Agenda is Live","tags":["event","devopsworldjenkinsworld2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"blog/author/alyssat","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9b44e013-999c-51f8-b612-64b922311110","slug":"/blog/2018/07/20/devops-world-jenkins-world-2018-agenda-is-live/","strippedHtml":"This year the Jenkins project introduced a few exciting efforts:\nConfiguration as Code, Jenkins X, Jenkins Evergreen, Blue Ocean and Pipeline.\nWith DevOps World-Jenkins World San Francisco and Nice only a few short months away,\nwe’ve made sure to include plenty of sessions related to these exciting efforts on the agenda.\nWith that said, the agenda for both cities is now live and will include workshops and deep dive\nsessions on these efforts and much more.\nProject contributors for these efforts will be present at both conferences as well, come say ‘hello’.\nHere’s a glimpse of what’s on the agenda:\n\nWorkshops\n\nBuilding Continuous Delivery for Microservices with Jenkins X\n\nCreating a Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins 2\n\nJenkins Administration Fundamentals\n\nJenkins Pipeline Fundamentals\n\nAnd more\n\nSessions\n\nCommon Pitfalls in Jenkins Security and How to Avoid Them –\nOleg Nenashev\n\nHabits, Tips and Tricks to Efficiently Automate Tasks with Jenkins -\nMichael Paillloncy\n\nSafely Upgrading Jenkins Everyday - Baptiste Mathus -\nBaptiste Mathus\n\nRunning Jenkins at Scale on Kubernetes – Guillermo Palacio -\nGuillermo Palacio\n\nContinuously Delivering an Easy-to-Use Jenkins with Jenkins Evergreen –\nTyler Croy\n\n“Look ma, no hands” – Manage Configuration as Code\nEwelina Wilkosz &\nNicolas De Loof\n\nAutomate Testing in Your Container Platform with Jenkins –\nEleanor Mehlenbacher\n\nmuch more\n\nSee the full agenda for both cities here:\n\nDevOps World – Jenkins World 2018 San Francisco Agenda\n\nDevOps World – Jenkins World 2018 Nice Agenda\n\nYou can plan on this to be highly educational, wildly engaging… overall an excellent space for collaborative conversations with project maintainers, contributors, and active community members.\n\nSee you there!\n\nIf you need more persuasion, use the code JWFOSS to get 30% discount off your pass.","title":"DevOps World-Jenkins World 2018 Agenda is Live","tags":["event","jenkins-world"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"blog/author/alyssat","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"47f0fe41-917d-5d9c-a643-b28ab9b12877","slug":"/blog/2018/03/05/jenkins-world-talk-proposal-tips/","strippedHtml":"You’ve marked your calendar to alert you weeks in advance of the CFP deadline.\nYou’ve spent your nights and weekends to skillfully craft your abstract and you\nare convinced this is THE one.

It was an amazing conference for Jenkins users in China. There were\nalmost 450 attendees to enjoy a lovely day with Jenkins creator, Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\n\nThere were 12 wonderful presentations, 1 workshop and 1 open space to set the stage for JUC China.\nThe day began with Kohsuke, welcomed to the stage by all the attendees here with their warm\napplauses. All of them are fans of Jenkins and Kohsuke.  Thanks to Kohsuke, he made a wonderful presentation to show the past, present and future of Jenkins for Chinese Jenkins users.\n\nThe co-founder of DevOps Times community, Le Zhang released a report of adoption of Deployment Pipeline in Chinese IT organization.\nThe report shows that Jenkins is the most popular tool for DevOps and CD in China.\n\nIt also has proven that “If it hurts, do it more often!” is right because the IT organization who deploy more frequently, deployment  failure would be less.\n\nThe Three Musketeers of DevOps in China (Le Zhang, Xuefeng Shi,Forest Jing) have demonstrated a DevOps pipeline based on Jenkins and many open-source software such as Kubernetes, Gitlab, etc.\n\nAfter the presentation, lots of fans waited in line to take pictures with Kohsuke.\n\nHere are some photos of the JUC China. We really enjoyed it.\n\nLastly, as an organizer for JUC China, I would like to thank Kohsuke Kawaguchi, Alyssa Tong, Sam Van Oort and so many friends from CloudBees and Jenkins community to have given us so many help to make the first JUC China an amazing and successful conference for Jenkins users in China. We look forward to organizing many more JUC China.","title":"Jenkins User Conference China Recap","tags":["event","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"blog/author/alyssat","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"alyssat","limit":8,"skip":8,"numPages":6,"currentPage":2}},
