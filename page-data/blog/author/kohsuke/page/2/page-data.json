It will be one big party for\neverything Jenkins, from users to developers, from the community to vendors.\nThere will be more of what people always loved in past user conferences, such\nas technical sessions from users and developers, the Ask the Experts booth and\nplugin development workshop, and even more has been added, such as Jenkins\ntraining pre-conference, workshops and the opportunity to get certified for\nfree. Jenkins World is a not-to-be-missed.\n\nFor me, the best part of Jenkins World is the opportunity to meet other Jenkins\nusers and developers face-to-face. We all interact on IRC, Google Groups or\nGitHub, but when you have a chance to meet in person, the person behind the\nGitHub ID or IRC name, whose plugin you use every day, becomes a real person.\nYour motivation might be a little different from mine, but we have the breath\nin the agenda to cover everyone from new users to senior plugin developers.\n\nThis year, you’ll have more opportunities than ever before to learn about\nJenkins and continuous delivery/DevOps practices, and explore what Jenkins has\nto offer.\n\nIf you are travelling from somewhere, you might as well get a two-day Jenkins training course to be held onsite, starting Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, you can attend your choice of workshops, which gives you more hands-on time to go deeper, including:\n\nThe DevOps Toolkit 2.0 Workshop\n\nLet’s Build a Jenkins Pipeline\n\nPreparing for Jenkins Certification\n\nIntro to Plugin Development\n\nCD and DevOps Maturity for Managers\n\nOn Wednesday, the formal conference kicks off. Throughout Wednesday and\nThursday, you can choose from sessions spread across five tracks and covering\na diverse range of topics like infrastructure as code, security, containers,\npipeline automation, best practices, scaling Jenkins and new community\ndevelopment initiatives.\n\nAt Jenkins World, you’ll be exposed to projects going on in the community such\nas Blue Ocean, a new Jenkins UX project. You can\nlearn more about Jenkins 2 - a major release for the project, and based on the\nhuge number of downloads we saw in the weeks following its introduction at the\nend of April, it was a big +1. At Jenkins World, you will be immersed in\nJenkins and community, and leave knowing that you are part of a meaningful open\nsource project that, with your involvement, can do anything!\n\nThis year there will only be one Jenkins World conference, so that everyone\ninvolved in Jenkins can get together in one place at one time and actually see\neach other. I understand that it might be a bit more difficult for Jenkins\nusers outside of the US to make it to Jenkins World, but hopefully we made the\nevent worth your visit. As the final push on the back, CloudBees has created a\nspecial international program\nfor those who are coming from outside the United States.  You’ll have\ntime to talk with all of the other Jenkins users who have made the journey from\nacross the globe, you’ll be able to attend exclusive networking events and\nmore.\n\nI hope to see you September 13th through 15th in Santa Clara at\nJenkins World in Santa Clara!\n\nRegister for Jenkins World in\nSeptember with the code JWFOSS for a 20% discount off your pass.","title":"Join me for Jenkins World 2016","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d6aef4a7-7579-5619-b25e-5569e48f5464","slug":"/blog/2016/07/07/jenkins-2.7.1/","strippedHtml":"It’s been almost three months since we’ve released Jenkins 2.0, the first ever major version upgrade for this 10 year old project. The 2.x versions since then has been adopted by more than 20% of the users, but one segment of users who haven’t seen the benefits of Jenkins 2 is those who has been running LTS releases.\n\nBut that is no more! The new version of Jenkins LTS release we just released is 2.7.1, and now LTS users get to finally enjoy Jenkins 2.\n\nThis release also officially marks the end-of-life for Jenkins 1.x. There won’t be any future release of Jenkins 1.x beyond this point. If you are worried about the upgrade, don’t be! The core of Jenkins is still the same, and all the plugins & existing configuration will just work.","title":"Jenkins 2 hits LTS","tags":["lts","jenkins2"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"8d1a1951-ad97-5021-a398-24ee5d471516","slug":"/blog/2016/04/26/jenkins-20-is-here/","strippedHtml":"Over the past 10 years, Jenkins has really\ngrown to a\nde-facto standard tool that millions of people use to handle automation in\nsoftware development and beyond.  It is quite remarkable for a project that\noriginally started as a hobby project under a different name. I’m very proud.\n\nAround this time last year,\nwe’ve\ncelebrated 10 years, 1000 plugins, and 100K installations. That was a good time\nto retrospect, and we started thinking about the next 10 years of Jenkins and\nwhat’s necessary to meet that challenge.  This project has long been on a\nweekly \"train\" release model, so it was useful to step back and think about a\nbig picture.\n\nThat is where three pillars of Jenkins 2.0 have emerged from.\n\nFirst, one of the challenges our users are facing today is that the automation\nthat happens between a commit and a production has significantly grown in its\nscope. Because of this, the clothing that used to fit (aka \"freestyle project\",\nwhich was the workhorse of Jenkins) no longer fits. We now need something that\nbetter fits today’s use cases like \"continuous delivery pipeline.\" This is why\nin 2.0 we’ve added the pipeline capability. This 2 year old effort allows you\nto describe your chain of automation in a textual form. This allows you to\nversion control it, put it alongside your source tree, etc. It is also actually\na domain specific language (DSL) of Groovy, so when your pipeline grows in\ncomplexity/sophistication, you can manage its complexity and keep it\nunderstandable far more easily.\n\nSecond, over time, Jenkins has developed the \"assembly required before initial\nuse\" feeling. As the project has grown, the frontier of interesting development\nhas shifted to plugins, which is how it should be, but we have left it up to\nusers to discover & use them. As a result, the default installation became very\nthin and minimal, and every user has to find several plugins before Jenkins\nbecomes really functional. This created a paradox of choice and unnecessarily\nhurt the user experience. In 2.0, we reset this thinking and tried to create\nmore sensible out of the box experience that solves 80% use cases for 80% of\npeople. You get something useful out of the box, and you can get some\nconsiderable mileage out of it before you start feeling the need of plugins.\nThis allows us to focus our development & QA effort around this base\nfunctionality, too. By the way, the focus on the out of the box experience\ndoesn’t stop at functionality, either. The initial security setup of Jenkins is\nimproved, too, to prevent unprotected Jenkins instances from getting abused by\nbotnets and attacks.\n\nThird, we were fortunate to have a number of developers with UX background\nspend some quality time on Jenkins, and they have made a big dent in improving\nvarious parts of Jenkins web UI. The setup wizard that implements the out of\nthe box experience improvement is one of them, and it also includes other parts\nof Jenkins that you use all the time, such as job configuration pages and new\nitem pages. This brings much needed attention to the web UI.\n\nAs you can see, 2.0 brings a lot of exciting features on the table, but this is\nan evolutionary release, built on top of the same foundation, so that your\nexisting installations can upgrade smoothly. After this initial release, we’ll\nget back to our usual weekly release march.  Improvements will be made\nto those pillars and others in coming months and years continuously. If you’d\nlike to get a more in-depth look at Jenkins 2.0, please join us in our virtual\nJenkins meetup 2.0 launch event.\n\nThank you very much for everyone who made Jenkins 2.0 possible. There are\ntoo many of you\nto thank individually, but you know who you are. I wanted to thank CloudBees in\nparticular for sponsoring the time of many of those people. Ten years ago, all I\ncould utilize was my own night & weekend time. Now I’ve got a team of smart\npeople working with me to carry this torch forward, and a big effort like 2.0\nwouldn’t have been possible without such organized effort.","title":"Jenkins 2.0 is here!","tags":["jenkins2"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"373b2161-734e-5842-834d-acb2ff01bd55","slug":"/blog/2015/10/01/upcoming-in-office-hours-jenkins-2-0/","strippedHtml":"+\nI hope many of you have had a chance to see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/vbXK7JJekFw[the Jenkins 2.0 thread]. +\nI'm going to use https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours[the office hours next Wednesday] to go through this proposal. +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThis is still primarily for developers in the project, as it's \"just\" a proposal with lots of details unspecified.
