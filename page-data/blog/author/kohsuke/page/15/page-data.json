All of these guys not only just use Jenkins but wrote additional plugins/programs to really tailor Jenkins into fitting their needs, and I think those would be really informative for those who are already using Jenkins, as well as those who are thinking about using Jenkins. +\n +\n\n+\nThis time we also have a couple of talks that discuss how to develop plugins.

I have this impression that Israeli people form a close-knit community on their own (somewhat like Japanese people do), perhaps because of the difference in the language or the culture. One of the great things about those communities are that people are well connected, and so reaching the right ears and spreading the ideas are easier. JUC Israel turns out to be the biggets JUC we had this year. Shlomi told me that some 230 people registered and 240 people showed up, and this negative last-minute cancellation ratio is unheard of! We had booths from sponsors, 2 concurrent tracks of technical talks, and wonderful Israeli food, in a nice hotel by the beach. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/296/category/5/created-monthly-list-2012-7[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712090747-e447b7c7.jpg[image] +\n] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nFor me, the conference started the night before, when JFrog folks took us to the Hudson restaurant, which was a wonderful steak house. Needless to say I took a lot of pictures. Hudson was great, and I got a wet-wipe in the end to wipe my hands off with Hudson. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/324/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712091422-d48662cb.jpg[image] +\n] +\n\n+\n+\n+\n\n+\nAs for the hightlights from the sessions. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/363/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712092442-6b807f97.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nAfter I and Shlomi have done the keynote, Amir from HP did a wonderful job showing off how he uses the multi-configuration project type (AKA \"matrix project\".) This is one of the areas where we made a lot of improvements lately, and one that I highlighted in my talk. I've always been feeling that this feature needs to be advertised more, so it was just perfect in that regard. It was also very useful for me personally, as I got some inspirations about improvements while he talks. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/384/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093014-62a9271b.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nSacha then talked about why the future of server-side applications are in PaaS. He had this one point where he said increasing the failure rate of software projects isn't necessarily a bad thing — if in a time frame of a year, you can do 10 projects and 2 succeed, then while that's only 20% success rate, it's better than doing 4 projects in the same time and having only 1 succeed. IOW, a machine-gun does a far more damage than a pistol, even though their accuracy can be much lower. And PaaS/Continuous-delivery plays a central role here becauses those are what lets you deliver 10 features in a year, instead of 4. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/397/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093400-c7816855.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nEyal from RedHat and Ronen from Ginger did two sessions showing off their use of Jenkins. One of the common theme in them is to use a text format (Puppet for Eyal and Groovy DSL for Ronen) to manage definitions of a large number of jobs. I think there's a lot of value in managing job definitions outside the current GUI, and I'm going to encourage Ronen to move his Groovy DSL project into the Jenkins CI project. I also felt that the template feature in Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees was validated, as it provides a similar capability (and in my opinion more easily deployable.) +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/391/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093221-0c896346.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nAnother talk that made a strong impression on me was the introductory plugin development talk from Noam, who works for JFrog and develops the Jenkins Artifactory plugin. I expected there to be only like 20-30 people, but it turns out about half the audience is there, indicating the high degree of interest to customizing Jenkins! In the past, all my favorite JUC talks came from those who I call \"super Jenkins admins\" who not only figure out how to combine some plugins, but also developed a few glue plugins. And those those extra finish makes all the difference! +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/411/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093759-5aec89e0.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThe conference concluded with a social in the garden looking a sunset into the Mediterranean sea.

While many are French, some of the attendees come from all over the Europe. I was able to see some familiar faces, as well as those who I've only known by their names. +\n +\n\n+\nI tried to get in and out of both tracks to get the sense of what's going on, so that I can report them later, and here's my notes. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/75/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423121146-816f0806.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI kicked off the whole day with a keynote, looking back what we've done since we became Jenkins. I've looked into various activities in the community, such as LTS, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program[Jenkins CIA], https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+in+Ruby[Ruby plugin development], and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/UI+Enhancements[UI enhancements]. I updated my adoption statistics slides (we are happy to report that we crossed https://imod.github.com/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html[40K installations] in our tracking), and reported that JFrog is now https://java.dzone.com/announcements/jenkins-ci-and-jfrog-announce[hosting our repositories] that we rely on for the development. I showed some of what we've been lately working on at CloudBees — such as the upcoming version of https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb[Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees] that support high-availability, https://www.cloudbees.com/press-room/cloudbees-donates-five-plugins-jenkins-community.cb[our giving away the folder plugin for free] (as in beer), and previews of some not quite public yet features, which is a treat only for those who came! +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/89/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423123054-9f4acaef.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIn the first slot, https://twitter.com/gboissinot/[Gregory Boissinot] went through a plugin development workshop. This was actually something I really wanted to understand, so that I get the objective view on where the pitfalls are. Even though the talk was in French, I did understand the code he was showing, and I took some notes about having some kind of skeleton code generator — for example, there's a common pattern for building an UI bound model object (for asking the user to enter data that has structures, persisting them, and so on), and having a code generator command line tool (like https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins.rb[jenkins.rb] has) could be really handy. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/93/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423123825-9ef5019f.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIn another room, https://twitter.com/ndeloof[Nicolas] and Mathieu were showing their https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin[\"build flow\"] plugin, which lets you write a workflow in Groovy DSL. Choreographing a complex workflow that involves multiple jobs is a commoon challenge among any Jenkins users, and so this talk was well attended, and I'm really looking forward to seeing this plugin mature (there's https://cisco.webex.com/ciscosales/lsr.php?AT=pb&SP=MC&rID=60616172&rKey=7caa63dde29ef758[a separate effort] to integrate BPMN workflow into Jenkins, see more about that here.) One thing I learned about Groovy DSL since then is the AST transformation. I'm thinking it might allow us to convert the DSL workflow script into a continuation passing style so that you can suspend/resume workflow at arbitrary point. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/106/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423125816-eb3613bb.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThe day was so packed that we didn't even waste the lunch time! While attendees are eating, we had lightening talks in the room. Olivier showed off how Apache runs Jenkins, which is quite sizable, then I pitched in for https://twitter.com/4imod[Domonik], who couldn't make it to the conference, and covered the scriptler plugin. Vincent followed and covered the similar Groovy system console. Harpreet then closed off the lunch lightening talks by showing the templates plugin in Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/111/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423130341-35bbfbae.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIn the afternoon, https://twitter.com/aheritier[Arnaud], one of our French gangs, showed how you can set up the iOS development on Jenkins (from code change to test to the delivery of the binaries to actual phones.) Bruno then did a demo of how he uses DEV@cloud and RUN@cloud to quickly set up continuous deployment for Java webapps. For system integraters that deal with lots of projects, I think it is a great combination (for example allowing you to hand over the entire development environment to the customer when the project is over.) +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/140/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423133439-5a7b4fbe.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nWhile all that is going on in one room, in another room Lars Kruse showed off how the old meets the new — where you https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/ClearCase+UCM+Plugin[take ClearCase UCM and use it to do validated merge], in which only the changes tested by Jenkins become visible to the rest of the team. I personally don't know much about ClearCase, but it was very interesting that emerging techniques like validated merge can be applied on more traditional SCM tools. He also said his company works with clients to develop custom Jenkins plugins. I always felt that any big company adopting Jenkins need some custom glue plugins, and I regularly come across those companies, but CloudBees can only help so many. It's great to see that there are more help available now! +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/188/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423164957-bae4f4ad.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n\n+\nThe talk that followed was from https://twitter.com/#!/jcarsique[Julien Carsique] from Nuxeo, discussing how he manages and improves the CI environment for his organization. Now, I regret I didn't take all the notes about details, but I think this was one of the best presentations of the day for me. I remember thinking that if we had the best Jenkins administrator award for those who push things to the limit and beyond, he would be my top pick. IIRC, he had a major Maven projects that span across different repos and all. He set up Jenkins such that any change triggers a cascade of new builds of downstream jobs, which later then fan out to cross-platform test jobs, then he made the whole thing visualized so you can track exactly where the time is spent and how those changes propagate. I think this was very inspirational to many other fellow Jenkins users, and I hope he will put his slides somewhere so that other people can mimic what he's done. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/144/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423134050-8dd4dca8.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n\n+\nBack to the big room, my fellow colleagues https://twitter.com/#!/connolly_s[Stephen] and https://twitter.com/#!/singh_harpreet[Harpreet] did the only introductory talk in the whole day, going through check lists of production Jenkins deployments, recapping why you want CI, etc. (And I always forget that there are still many who don't know much about Jenkins!) +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/156/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423135955-e072a9a0.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIt was also great to see and hear https://sebastian-bergmann.de/[Sebastian Bergmann], the guy behind https://jenkins-php.org/[Jenkins PHP], talk about Jenkins and PHP integrations. I wish we had more of those people who bridge our community to different communities and help us spread the ideas. He even kindly gave me his Jenkins/PHP book and signed it for me! +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/159/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423140457-1e3a42c8.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n\n+\nAside from talks, food was great, especially for those of us who came from the U.S. I've got some good inspirations about where we need to work. And I also managed to implement the search filter in the update center during the day, in response to the valid complaint from Sebastian. For virtual communities like ours, it's really good to meet people in the meat space and put faces on names. Build automation engineers are often somewhat lonely in their respective organizations — there just aren't that many people who get excited about automating things away, and so having so many of like-minded folks in one room was by itself a great experience. +\n +\n\n+\nOn the things to improve side, I felt that workshops was tricky to do in a limited time and in a big room. Maybe it would work out better if there's a smaller room where smaller number of people can gather and hack away (probably some time slots designated for some specific topics), then we can collectively merge pending important pull requests, teaching how to develop plugins, or ask others to look at their plugins, etc. There also can be a valid discussion about JUC, run nicely in exchange of admission fee, vs JUC run cheaply but free. +\n +\n\n+\nIn any case, I think the quality of presentations were very good, and knowing local Jenkins developers/users would help expand your horizon. As I said in the beginning, we are takin JUC around the world this year. https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-newyork.cb[The one in New York] is just in the next week, followed by Herzelia (Israel), Tokyo, San Francisco, and Antwerp.
