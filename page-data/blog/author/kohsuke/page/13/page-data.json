So naturally these folks tend to keep things to themselves. +\n +\n\n+\nThat's why I've been wanting to do a meet-up in Seoul for some time, yet I didn't know anyone there to get one going. That changed in Jenkins User Conferene in San Francisco last year. I pitched this to someone who worked for Samsung, and he introduced me to folks in Seoul, and the ball started rolling from there. +\n +\n\n+\nThe meet-up was held Friday, at Samsung headquarter in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0&list=PLEC422D53B7588DC7&index=10[Gangnam], Seoul. +\n +\n\n+\nimage:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Samsung_headquarters.jpg/320px-Samsung_headquarters.jpg[image] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI kicked off the meet-up with a short presentation on why I think local communities are important, especially in Korea. Jang Seung-heui from Samsung then talked about Groovy scripting in Jenkins, and how it helps him manage a large installation of Jenkins (the slides and the talk were in Korean, so this is my guess based on the occasional English words that appeared in slides.) Junho Yoon from NHN talked about his simple update site plugin to show how he helps teams run their own Jenkins instances. I've done another presentation showing various Jenkins plugins for workflow-ish things. +\n +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI wasn't sure how many people would actually come, since I really didn't have any reach in the Korean software developer community. But somehow the words must have spread, as I counted more than 50 people in the room. +\n +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nUnfortunately, due to the rules in the building, I wasn't allowed to record the talks. So no videos from this meet-up — if you missed this one, you'd have to come to the next one! +\n +\n\n+\nAfter the meet-up, a dozen of us headed to the busy night scene in Gangnam. There were so many people that we had to form a line to get to the street! +\n +\n\n+\nEventually we found ourselves in a German-style pub. I say German \"style\" because everything from beer to foods were Korean, except the name of the pub and the wall paper. +\n +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI've pitched my hope that we keep it going, and that there'll be the next meet-up.

All in all we counted 721 responses --- thanks everyone for voicing their thoughts! +\n +\n\n+\nNaturally, it took a while to tally that many responses, but thanks to https://twitter.com/ProductPrincipl[Lisa], we https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb[now have the result] in time for the holiday. +\n +\n\n+\nAs you can see in https://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/total-jenkins.svg[our installation tracking], Jenkins installation base has grown 66% since the last year, so I was naturally very curious if this has affected the area of focus for us the developers. +\n +\n\n+\nHowever, when https://pages.cloudbees.com/Jenkins_Survey_2011_JenkinsSurveyDownloadPage.html[compared to the result from the last year], the first thing I notice is the consistency in many metrics. For example, about 83% of people considers Jenkins mission critical this year, and the last year it was 82%. The distribution between beginner/intermediate/expert users are also quite similar. +\n +\n\n+\nBut this year, we asked a number of questions that we didn’t ask the last year. One of them is the version control systems that people use. Here, we get 61% Subversion, 50% Git, and everything else is within 10%. So clearly we need to start shipping Git plugin pre-bundled! +\n +\n\n+\nAnother interesting question that we asked is the languages people use. There’s a surprising number of C/C++ projects on Jenkins (and good number of Ruby, PHP, Python, and C#!), which made me feel that we need to hear more from those users about the kind of tool integrations we need to be providing. +\n +\n\n+\nOne more gem is that whopping 11% of the respondents said they have written and contributed plugins to the community (that’s 82 people!), and another 9% of the respondents said they wrote one but just not sharing it because it doesn’t make sense (7%), or they couldn’t (2%). That’s about 1 in every 5 respondents writing some plugins, which is amazing, if you ask me. +\n +\n\n+\nAnother big part of the survey was asking respondents what are important in Jenkins --- is it documentation, quality, UI, etc? But I guess I shouldn’t spoil your fun of actually https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb[looking at the result], so please go take a look yourself! Also, if you want to tally the numbers yourself, here’s the anonymized raw data. +\n +\n\n+\nI’ll hopefully do a separate post on the efforts we are taking to answer those points raised in the survey in coming days. +","title":"2012 Jenkins Survey results are in","tags":["general","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"2eaec6cf-6301-5d69-8962-b52a70cf9ccf","slug":"/blog/2012/12/25/jenkins-meet-up/","strippedHtml":"\">\n\n우리는 2013년 1월25일 저녁에 Jenkins meet-up을 삼성전자와 함께 준비하고 있습니다.\nMeet-up은 서초사옥에서 진행될 예정이며 추후 변경될 수 있습니다.\n발표자는 일본 커뮤니티에서 활동중인 Cactuman과 삼성이고 Groovy script를 이용한 job 일괄설정\n에 대해서 발표할 예정입니다.\n\nJenkins를 설치한 통계를 통해 저희도 한국에 많은 사용자가 있다는것을 알고 있었습니다.\n지금까지는 메인 Jenkins community에서 컨택하는데 실패했었지만 이번에 그런 상황이 해결된것에 너무 흥분됩니다.\n\n이번 meet-up에 참가할 의사가 있으면 meetup.com 에 회답해 주시면 됩니다.\n참가비는 없으며 우리는 Jenkins,plugin 들과 함께한 경험들(간단한 주제를 포함)을 한국의 Jenkins user와\n공유 할 더 많은 발표자를 찾고 있습니다.\n\n여러분의 많은 참가를 기대합니다.\n\nWe are organizing a Jenkins meet-up in Seoul in the evening of Jan 25th 2013, thanks to the help of folks at Samsung.
