This release line branches off from a bit old Jenkins release (in this case 1.409), and we will only put important backported bug fixes. We’ll keep releasing 1.409.2, 1.409.3, and so on, as such bugs appear, and in several months (our current thinking is 3 months) we’ll designate another release and repeat this process all over again. I think it provides more comfortable upgrade path for larger deployments. For more about this, see Wiki.\n\nIn large companies that use Jenkins in a large scale, there often is a team of people who looks at incoming Jenkins release, tests it with their environments and their plugins, and then let their internal group consume them. With this release line, I’m calling for them to join the effort on this branch. Vojtech Juranek from Red Hat is already helping us tremendously, so is Yahoo in choosing the base release line and backporting. But it’d be great to get more people on board, as I think it’ll benefit everyone to have a larger number of eyeballs on the same code.

About 10 people came, including the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Static+Code+Analysis+Plug-ins[static code analysis plugin] fame Ullrich Hafner, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin[Androd emulator plugin] fame https://twitter.com/orrc[Christopher Orr], the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin[instant messenger plugin] (and others) fame https://twitter.com/#!/kutzi[Christoph Kutzinski]. Some of us came from pretty far away places like Munich, Bonn, and Netherland. There was a good mix of existing developers and new developers, too. +\n +\n\n+\nDuring the hackathon, new folks developed whopping three plugins — a security realm that connects to https://github.com/jenkinsci/kerberos-authenticator-plugin[Kerberos (password entering kind, not SSO)], https://github.com/jenkinsci/builton-column-plugin[a plugin that adds a list view column to show where the last build was done], and https://github.com/jenkinsci/extra-columns-plugin/[another plugin that attempts to collect small list view column implmentations]. German translations were improved, automated installation of Android SDKs are discussed and its implementation strategies explained. I've done my share of contribution by working on https://github.com/jenkinsci/jruby-xstream[XStream support for JRuby], which is one of the ground work necessary for JRuby-based Jenkins plugin development, and I also showed the prototype Groovy-based templating that can potentially supercede Jelly. There were additional exchange of tips and tricks, how you do this and that. +\n +\n\n+\nStrong coffee and engaged conversations kept me awake all day, although German keyboard layout (on top of usual IDE difference + Mac/PC difference) made it hard to code on other people's computers, but all in all it was a very productive hackathon. In fact, the best ever. We wrapped up around 7pm and headed to a seafood restaurant near Elbe river, stayed there until 11pm-ish. +\n +\n\n+\nThe next hackathon is planned in Paris toward the end of the month.

But this is not true. +\n +\n\n+\nAs Jenkins gains traction among .NET developers, it's becoming increasingly clear that Java is very alien to them. They naturally have no idea of what a war file means, and often don't even have Java installed, and so it was _just not easy enough_ for them to start using Jenkins. +\n +\n\n+\nI'm happy to report that I've finally fixed this problem with the new Windows installer. It is primarily packaged as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer[an MSI file] — a common format that seasoned Windows devs/admins are familiar with. It can, for example, be deployed remotely on a large number of servers via Active Directory remotely. Or you can just double-click it to install it interactively. It bundles JRE, so no separate Java installation is needed. +\n +\n\n+\nThe package also contains the bootstrap `+setup.exe+`, to install .NET 2.0 runtime if it's not installed yet. Between that and JRE, it got all the dependencies covered. I tested that by installing it on a fresh Windows XP install. +\n +\n\n+\nSo I hope this makes Jenkins more attractive to .NET and other developers who live and die by Windows.","title":"Windows installers are now available","tags":["general","releases","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","id":"8e9624ea-c26b-5ad5-a5d4-3668368eba52","slug":"/blog/2011/03/13/jenkins-hits-1-400/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins] is now at 1.400 (as of last Monday, yes, I know. But better late than never...). As with https://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/04/22/hudson-hits-1300?force=752[1.300] and https://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2008/03/hudson_hits_120.html?force=824[1.200], this release doesn't particularly signify any substantial major release, but nonetheless it is a milestone for those of us who are involved in the project — I think repeating something 400 times is something one can be proud of. It's a bit like climbing a mountain. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, ... and when you look up, voila! +\n +\n\n+\nIn 2 years since 1.300, which was April 2009, we've added a lot of features. We now have a CLI to manipulate the server, auto-installation of JDK/Ant/Maven to simplify cluster management, concurrent builds of the same job, community-contributed localizations to 20+ languages, boolean expression over the job/label assignment control, parallel initialization based on a dynamically built acyclic directed graph, console annotations to enrich the build output, far more extensible queue (that enabled a lot of plugins), Windows 7 / Vista support, improved controller/agent communication stability, Maven 3 support, and then all around performance improvements, in memory footprint, in startup time, and in page rendering speed. +\n +\n\n+\nAnd of course, we had to change the name of the project. That was a real distraction, but now that the divorce is over, things have been https://bobbickel.blogspot.com/2011/03/jenkins-vs-hudson-time-to-upgrade.html[moving well] for Jenkins. I guess any organization (including any sizable OSS project) is really more than sum of all individuals. If you take a store of Target and replace all its workers by those of nearby Staples, it'll probably not work out well. I think https://jenkins-ci.org/why[people understand that]. +\n +\n\n+\nAnd on the positive side, I do think we came out stronger. We are now running https://jenkins-ci.org/node/280[governance meetings on IRC], we now have https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins[somewhat more formal governance structure]. The core development is actually accelarating with the help of https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/graphs/impact[many new developers], such as Olivier Lamy, (scroll to the right), and https://twitter.com/#!/jenkins_release[plugin releases kept coming at amazing rate] — we are now at 350+ plugins, more than doubled since 1.300. +\n +\n\n+\nLooking at future, we are working on a number of new initiatives in the community, too. For example, Arnaud Héritier is working on revisiting https://issues.jenkins.io/[our JIRA project structure], Andrew Bayer is running a contest for new logo, Tyler is in process of getting additional hardwares at OSUOSL for the project. I'm also doing a lot of things, but for example, I'm going to write a proposal to start a stable patch releases of Jenkins that only consists of backported important bug fixes, in addition to the current weekly release model. Several large users maintain private branches of Jenkins, and so I think it makes a lot of sense for those folks to align their efforts around this release line. I'm also thinking that we could launch a community acceptance testing (CAT) effort around this, much like https://qa.netbeans.org/processes/cat/67/faqs.html[NetBeans] and https://glassfish.java.net/quality/portal/[GlassFish] have done it. I think the first stable release line would branch off from 1.400, so if anything that's another reason you should upgrade to 1.400. +\n +\n\n+\nWhen I reflect on the project, I'm surprised at just how much work there is to be done, after so much that has been achived. But I'm still excited at what we can do with this platform. I thank everyone for their continued patoronage of Jenkins, and I hope to see more of you in the mailing lists, in the chat rooms, and in the meet-up events.

Initially I wasn't worried — I thought it was just another java.net outage that will resolve itself in a few hours — but a little research a bit later revealed that Hudson was locked down and being https://weblogs.java.net/blog/communitymanager/archive/2010/11/03/javanet-begins-migration-collabnet-kenai-infrastructure[migrated to new java.net infrastructure]. +\n +\n\n+\nI and the whole community was quite surprised by this, as we are supposed to be \"notified as soon as we assign a date for [our] projects to move.\" But by the time the developer community noticed, the project was already locked down, repository is read-only, and mailing lists can stop functioning any time. My immediate action was to contact the folks who are doing migration to get Hudson out of this cycle of the migration, but I was told that the ship has sailed and it was too late. +\n +\n\n+\nEven worse, there's no ETA — it'll definitely take a week, but since this is a Thanksgiving weekend, it can take longer, Oracle said. +\n +\n\n+\nI find this situation plain unacceptable, and https://java.net/projects/jersey/lists/dev/archive/2010-11/message/3[e-mails from the earlier migration effort] made me doubt if the new infrastructure is any better. I also had a pleasure of working closely with CollabNet folks over the past years and I was also involved in some earlier conversation and experiments about the new java.net infrastructure, and when it comes to performance and monitoring, CollabNet folks really knew what they are doing. So I had multiple reasons to worry if the new infrastructure can handle the load of java.net, which the old CollabNet-hosted one couldn't handle. +\n +\n\n+\nBut fortunately, since the general java.net migration has been announced, we've https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Mailing-list-change-proposal-td3047548.html[discussed] the migration of some of the project infrastructure. So we've accelerated the plan and implemented it, so as not to lose the critical project infrastructure services. +\n +\n +\n\nMailing Lists\n\n+\n\n+\nHudson mailing lists are moved to Google Groups. See https://hudson-labs.org/content/mailing-lists[more details here] and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Mailing%20List[here]. The new mailing lists provide a real search capability, decent UI for archives, and it makes it easier for people with multiple e-mail addresses to post from multiple addresses and receive just one copy. The stability of the service is also much better. +\n +\n\nSource code\n\n+\n\n+\nHudson core source code has been long synced to GitHub. We've been getting several contributions through that already, and people have been asking https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/On-the-future-of-Hudson-hosting-and-infrastructure-td393278i20.html[for] https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Git-repository-for-Hudson-td394409.html#a394412[Git] https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/hudson-plugins-git-repository-td1477941.html[migration] https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Hudson-on-github-td2252960.html[for] https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Expose-the-Hudson-SVN-as-a-GIT-repository-td391333.html[long] https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/version-control-for-hudson-source-bidirectional-git-lt-gt-svn-td978706.html[time] anyway. So going forward I'll be committing to and producing releases from https://github.com/hudson/hudson[the Hudson repository on GitHub] at `+https://kohsuke@github.com/hudson/hudson.git+`. +\n +\n\n+\nThe new Git-based repository would be far snappier to work with, and it'll make it easier for people to maintain private changes and contribute changes back. There's also a work in progress to set up Gerrit to streamline the patch review process to the core. So I think this further reduces the barrier of entry to the Hudson project and accelerate the progress. +\n +\n\n+\nThe migration of Hudson plugin repositories still needs to be discussed, so stay tuned for the updates in https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev[the dev list] today or tomorrow. I've developed a bulk import program whose output can be seen https://github.com/HudsonLabs[here], so I'm going to propose this as the migration strategy. +\n +\n +\n\nConclusions\n\n+\n\n+\nMy apologies that these changes had to happen quickly — I'm just as frustrated as you are, but given the circumstances, I think this is the best course of action. Hopefully everything will be in place within a few days.
