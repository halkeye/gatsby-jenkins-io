Dealing\nwith hundreds of jobs? Not so much. Having to scale to thousands of jobs?\nNow this is a real challenge.\n\nThis is the story of a journey to get out of the jungle of jobs…​\n\nStart of the journey\n\nAt the beginning of the journey there were several projects using roughly the same\ntechnologies. Those projects had several\nbranches, for maintenance of releases, for new features.\n\nIn turn, each of those branches had to be carefully built, deployed on different\nplatforms and versions, promoted so they could be tested for functionalities,\nperformances and security, and then promoted again for actual delivery.\n\nAdditionally, we had to offer the test teams the means to deploy any version of\ntheir choice on any supported platform in order to carry out some manual tests.\n\nThis represented, for each branch, around 20 jobs. Multiply this by the number of\nbranches and projects, and there you are: more than two years after the start\nof the story, we had more than 3500 jobs.\n\n3500 jobs. Half a dozen people to manage them all…​\n\nPreparing the journey\n\nHow did we deal with this load?\n\nWe were lucky enough to have several assets:\n\ntime - we had time to design a solution before the scaling went really out of\ncontrol\n\nforecast - we knew that the scaling would occur and we were not taken by\nsurprise\n\ntooling - the Jenkins Job DSL\nwas available, efficient and well documented\n\nWe also knew that, in order to scale, we’d have to provide a solution with the\nfollowing characteristics:\n\nself-service - we could not have a team of 6 people become a bottleneck for\nenabling CI/CD in projects\n\nsecurity - the solution had to be secure enough in order for it to be used by\nremote developers we never met and didn’t know\n\nsimplicity - enabling CI/CD had to be simple so that people having\nnever heard of it could still use it\n\nextensibility - no solution is a one-size-fits-all and must be flexible\nenough to allow for corner cases\n\nAll the mechanisms described in this article are available through the\nJenkins Seed plugin.\n\nCreating pipelines using the Job DSL and embedding the scripts in the code was\nsimple enough. But what about branching? We needed a mechanism to allow the\ncreation of pipelines per branch, by downloading the associated DSL and to\nrun it in a dedicated folder.\n\nBut then, all those projects, all those branches, they were mostly using the\nsame pipelines, give or take a few configurable items. Going this way would\nhave lead to a terrible duplication of code, transforming a job maintenance\nnightmare into a code maintenance nightmare.\n\nPipeline as configuration\n\nOur trick was to transform this vision of \"pipeline as code\" into a \"pipeline\nas configuration\":\n\nby maintaining well documented and tested \"pipeline libraries\"\n\nby asking projects to describe their pipeline not as code, but as property\nfiles which would:\n\ndefine the name and version of the DSL pipeline library to use\n\nuse the rest of the property file to configure the pipeline library, using\nas many sensible default values as possible\n\nPiloting the pipeline from the SCM\n\nOnce this was done, the only remaining trick was to automate the creation,\nupdate, start and deletion of the pipelines using SCM events. By enabling SCM\nhooks (in GitHub, BitBucket or even in Subversion), we could:\n\nautomatically create a pipeline for a new branch\n\nregenerate a pipeline when the branch’s pipeline description was modified\n\nstart the pipeline on any other commit on the branch\n\nremove the pipeline when the branch was deleted\n\nOnce a project wants to go in our ecosystem, the Jenkins team \"seeds\" the\nproject into Jenkins, by running a job and giving a few parameters.\n\nIt will create a folder for the project and grant proper authorisations, using\nActive Directory group names based on the project name.\n\nThe hook for the project must be registered into the SCM and you’re up and\nrunning.\n\nConfiguration and code\n\nMixing the use of strong pipeline libraries configured by properties and the\ndirect use of the Jenkins Job DSL is still possible. The Seed plugin\nsupports all kinds of combinations:\n\nuse of pipeline libraries only - this can even be enforced\n\nuse a DSL script which can in turn use some classes and methods defined in\na pipeline library\n\nuse of a Job DSL script only\n\nUsually, we tried to have a maximum reuse, through only pipeline libraries, for\nmost of our projects, but in other circumstances, we were less strict and\nallowed some teams to develop their own pipeline script.\n\nEnd of the journey\n\nIn the end, what did we achieve?\n\nSelf service ✔︎\n\nPipeline automation from SCM - no intervention from the Jenkins team but for\nthe initial bootstrapping\n\nGetting a project on board of this system can be done in a few minutes only\n\nSecurity ✔︎\n\nProject level authorisations\n\nNo code execution on the controller\n\nSimplicity ✔︎\n\nProperty files\n\nExtensibility ✔︎\n\nPipeline libraries\n\nDirect job DSL still possible\n\nSeed and Pipeline plugin\n\nNow, what about the Pipeline plugin? Both\nthis plugin and the Seed plugin have common functionalities:\n\nWhat we have found in our journey is that having a \"pipeline as configuration\"\nwas the easiest and most secure way to get a lot of projects on board, with\ndevelopers not knowing Jenkins and even less the DSL.\n\nThe outcome of the two plugins is different:\n\none pipeline job for the Pipeline plugin\n\na list of orchestrated jobs for the Seed plugin\n\nIf time allows, it would be probably a good idea to find a way to integrate the\nfunctionalities of the Seed plugin into the pipeline framework, and to keep\nwhat makes the strength of the Seed plugin:\n\npipeline as configuration\n\nreuseable pipeline libraries, versioned and tested\n\nLinks\n\nYou can find additional information about the Seed plugin and its usage at the\nfollowing links:\n\nthe Seed plugin itself\n\nJUC London, June 2015\n\nBruJUG Brussels, March 2016","title":"Jenkins Pipeline Scalability in the Enterprise","tags":["jenkins","scalability","dsl"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"dcoraboeuf","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I&#8217;ve started many years ago in the Java development before switching\nprogressively toward continuous delivery aspects.
