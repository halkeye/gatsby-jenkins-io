is a guest post by Mark Waite, who maintains\nthe git plugin,\nthe git client plugin,\nand is a technical evangelist for CloudBees, Inc.\n\nThe Jenkins project booth at Jenkins World 2017\nwill include the \"Pull Requests Corner\", recruiting new Jenkins contributors.\nWe think there are many people who will attend the conference without realizing how easy it is\nto help the Jenkins project, and how much the help is appreciated.\n\nMeet us in the \"Pull Requests Corner\" and we’ll help you find a way to help Jenkins.\nHere are some areas where we can use your help.\nMost of them do not require coding, and do not require a large time commitment.\n\nOne Minute Feedback on Your Version\n\nThe Jenkins changelog pages ( LTS and weekly) gather user experiences with specific Jenkins versions.\nYou can help other Jenkins users by clicking one of the weather icons in the LTS changelog (or the weekly changelog) for the release you’re using.\nChangelog feedback from weekly releases helps the release team select the long term support version.\nChangelog feedback from LTS releases helps other users prepare to upgrade.\n\nIt takes less than a minute, and helps the community (which will ultimately help you).\n\nFive Minutes to Answer a Question\n\nIn five minutes or less, you can help other Jenkins users.\n\nFor example:\n\nAnswer a question on the #jenkins channel of internet relay chat (IRC)\n\nAnswer a question on the Jenkins users mailing list\n\nAnswer a question on stackoverflow jenkins, jenkins plugins, or jenkins pipeline\n\nAnswer a question on reddit\n\nTen Minutes to Learn and Share\n\nIf you have ten minutes, you can learn something new and share what you learned.\n\nRead a Jenkins community blog post and tweet it with the hashtag #jenkinsci\n\nRead a devops.com blog post and share it on LinkedIn\n\nRead a CloudBees blog post and test drive an idea from it\n\nFind another Jenkins blog and share it (I recently discovered Matt Bajor’s ci/cd life blog)\n\nFifteen Minutes for Pipeline\n\nLiam Newman has created the \" Jenkins Minute\" video series.\nThey are brief video segments focusing on specific Jenkins functionality.\nChoose a video, watch it, and share what you learned on social media.\n\nTwenty Minutes for a Bug\n\nThe Jenkins bug tracker contains thousands of bugs.\nReviewing, duplicating, and clarifying bug reports takes time.\nWhen maintainers are reviewing, duplicating, and clarifying bug reports, they are not fixing bugs, and they are not adding new capabilities.\n\nYou can help maintainers by reviewing and duplicating a bug report that matters to you.\nA comment on a bug report is especially helpful when it confirms you’ve been able to duplicate the bug.\nIt is even more helpful if your verification includes the steps you took and how they differ from the original report.\n\nA bug report which has been duplicated, and includes clear instructions, is much more likely to receive maintainer attention.\nHelp yourself and others by duplicating bugs that matter to you.\n\nThirty Minutes for Documentation\n\nThe Jenkins documentation includes\nuser documentation ( guided tour and handbook) and\ndeveloper documentation ( tutorial, how-to guides, and reference).\nYou can help the documentation by describing something important to you clearly and completely.\n\nRefer to the instructions for documentation contributors to see how easy it is to help.\n\nForty Five Minutes for Translation\n\nIf English is not your native language, you can help with Jenkins localization.\nJenkins is used worldwide, and many users will benefit from translations.\nConsidering the rapid and continuing evolution of Jenkins, it is no surprise that there is plenty to translate.\nRefer to the internationalization guide for instructions to help you contribute translations.\n\nSixty Minutes for a Meetup\n\nLocal groups around the world meet often for Jenkins presentations, discussions, and demonstrations.\nOrganizing a Jenkins Area Meetup will introduce you to other users, and will let you explore new ways to benefit from Jenkins.\nThe team at jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com is ready to support your JAM with stickers, t-shirts, and more.\n\nWeek or More - Adopt a Plugin\n\nThe Jenkins plugin ecosystem covers a wide range of areas.\nJenkins plugin maintainers come from many different backgrounds, with many different interests.\nOften, a plugin maintainer may find that they want to do something different on the project, or they may leave the project.\nWhen a plugin maintainer is no longer able to maintain a plugin, they can place it for adoption.\n\nPlugins placed for adoption range from very specific use cases (node stalker plugin) to very general use cases (Subversion plugin).\n\nMaintaining an orphan plugin is a great way to contribute to the project.\nFollow the instructions to \" Adopt a Plugin\".\n\nSee You There!\n\nAll those techniques (and more) are available on the Jenkins participate page.\n\nLook for the \"Jenkins Needs You\" poster at Jenkins World, and come talk\nto us about the ways you can learn new things, address your concerns,\nand help Jenkins.\n\nJoin the Jenkins project at\nJenkins World on August 30-31,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Jenkins Needs You - Pull Request Corner at Jenkins World
