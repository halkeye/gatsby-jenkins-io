Draft of the upgrade plan assembled and shared with the community\n\nSeptember 2020 - Schedule for testing week and final transition week proposed.  Authentication options evaluated and selected\n\nOctober 2020 - Test upgrade performed and tested\n\nNovember 2020 - Final upgrade completed and verified\n\nConfronting the Complications\n\nInitial discussions between the Jenkins infrastructure team and the Linux Foundation identified complications related to authentication and SSL certificates.\nWe planned, negotiated, and tested our assumptions throughout the project.\n\nAuthentication\n\nJira servers at the Linux Foundation typically use Linux Foundation accounts for user access.\nUnfortunately, the Jenkins LDAP database includes over 100,000 users and for many of them, Linux Foundation username doesn’t correspond to Jenkins account username.\nIt was not feasible to transition 100,000 user accounts from the Jenkins LDAP database to the Linux Foundation accounts system and still complete the Jira upgrade before the November 28, 2020 deadline.\n\nThe Linux Foundation Project Services team evaluated authentication alternatives and confirmed that they could use the Jenkins LDAP server.\nUsing the Jenkins LDAP server spared us from two transitions, LDAP and Jira, and kept the project timeline feasible.\n\nSSL Certificates\n\nJira servers at the Linux Foundation use Let’s Encrypt to generate SSL certificates for HTTPS.\nThe Linux Foundation uses the DNS method to obtain SSL certificates.\nUnfortunately, the Jenkins project uses the HTTP method to obtain SSL certificates.\n\nThankfully, Olivier Vernin of the Jenkins project and Anton Baranov of the Linux Foundation found a solution.\nThey created an ACME record in the Jenkins DNS server and pointed the issues.jenkins.io DNS record at the new Linux Foundation Jira server.\n\nBuilding the Prototype\n\nAnton Baranov created a prototype Jira server, restored an older Jenkins Jira backup, and upgraded it to Jira 8.13.\nThat first restore detected that we had not provided the Jira attachments or the Jira avatars.\nThat attachments and avatars added multiple gigabytes to the initial backup data and were vital to complete the update.\n\nTesting the Upgrade\n\nA group of volunteers including Jenkins users, security team members, and infrastructure team members tested the upgrade during the week of October 26, 2020.\nThe tests confirmed that authentication worked as expected and that the Jira prototype was functioning as expected.\n\nWe thank the test team, including:\n\nDaniel Beck\n\nTim Jacomb\n\nOlivier Vernin\n\nMark Waite\n\nThe tests included:\n\nCreating and routing issues\n\nCommenting on issues\n\nViewing dashboards with the expected content\n\nLDAP settings\n\nEmail notification\n\nThe tests detected minor issues that Anton was able to correct in preparation for the final upgrade.\nThe testing team agreed that the tests were successful.\n\nDeploying the Upgrade\n\nOlivier Vernin announced the final upgrade by email to the Jenkins infra list with details of the changes happening during the upgrade.\nMonday, November 9, 2020, the final backup of the existing Jira server was copied into the new Linux Foundation server.\n\nThe final upgrade encountered issues that we had not seen during the initial tests.\nThe \"bumps and bruises\" from the unexpected issues were resolved by Anton Baranov as he used a multi-step upgrade process.\nThe steps included:\n\nRestore the earlier backup to Jira 7.13\n\nRestore the most recent backup\n\nUpgrade to Jira 8.13\n\nInstall avatars, attachments, and other images\n\nUpdate DNS entries to point to the new Jenkins Jira server\n\nLessons from the Upgrade\n\nLessons were related to timing, estimation, and communication.\n\nScheduling the Upgrade\n\nThe test upgrade started the week of October 19, 2020.\nIt took several days longer than originally expected.\nThankfully, we had allowed an extra week between the test upgrade and the production upgrade.\n\nThe originally announced schedule for the final upgrade was intentionally placed in a week that would not include a long term support release.\nThat reduced the risk of disruption if the upgrade took longer than required or failed and we had to roll back.\n\nEstimating the Work\n\nDiscussions with the Jenkins project Jira administrators and the Linux Foundation Jira experts provided very reasonable estimates of time to complete the work.\nWe intentionally allowed additional time between first test and final upgrade.\nWe needed that additional time and used it well as the testing week.\n\nCommunicating the Plan\n\nThe distributed nature of the Jenkins project makes communication challenging for major changes.\nWe communicated plans at various stages but still found occasions where the communication was insufficient.\nIn this case, the adage held true that it is, \"impossible to communicate too much\".\n\nThanks for your patience during the upgrade and thanks to the Linux Foundation for administering the Jenkins Jira server.","title":"Jira upgrade for

we have selected Jenkins 2.263 as a new baseline for the LTS release line, with ETA in December 2020.\nIt allows delivering significant and in some cases breaking changes which have been previously on hold.\nBeginning with the Jenkins 2.264 release on October 27, 2020, we’ve entered a period where the Jenkins weekly releases will include more significant changes than usual.\nThat period of more significant changes is expected to continue for a month or more.\nAs you may have seen from the release community ratings, there might be regressions and instabilities during this period.\n\nWe’re excited for the changes.\nThey help to improve user experience and to address the technical debt accumulated in the Jenkins core.\nWe invite Jenkins users to evaluate those changes and provide feedback.\nThis is an especially valuable time for users and administrators to test the weekly releases and report issues with them,\nespecially on Jenkins test environments.\nIn the Jenkins project we have invested a lot in test coverage for the main functionality,\nbut in many cases we rely on user feedback for exotic plugins and environments not yet covered by our test automation.\n\nThe most notable changes include:\n\nConfiguration UI - Tables to Divs\n\nCore - Spring Security replaces Acegi Security\n\nCore - XStream unfork\n\nUI - JQuery upgrade\n\nConfiguration UI - Tables to Divs\n\nJenkins 2.264 is the first weekly release to include the \"Tables to Divs migration\" user interface work of Josh Soref, Tim Jacomb, and Felix Queiruga.\nIt is a significant step to improve forms in the Jenkins user interface (configuration pages, build parameters, etc.), especially for users on narrow devices like tablets and phones.\n\nA better user interface\n\nThe transition from using HTML table tags to using HTML div tags provides a more attractive user interface for all users and a much better experience for users on narrower devices.\nBefore the conversion from table tags to div tags, the\"Manage Jenkins\" page looked like this in a 1024x768 window:\n\nAfter the conversion, the\"Manage Jenkins\" page now looks like this:\n\nThe user interface improvements from the transition are a nice step forward for Jenkins.\nHowever, because the user interface improvements require changes in plugins, we need your help.\n\nWe need users to test the latest weekly Jenkins releases with the plugins and configurations that are most important to them.\nWhen users detect an issue, we need them to report the issue with enough detail that a plugin maintainer can fix the issue.\nPlease add the tables-to-divs-regression label to the issues.\nThe tables-to-divs-regression label makes it easier to find issues related to the tables to divs transition.\n\nPlugin developers\n\nSeveral plugins have already been identified that may need changes.\nSee the Jira epic for plugins that are likely to need changes for the new user interface layout.\nThe list of open tables-to-divs-regression issues can also be used to see plugins that need changes.\n\nIf you can assist with plugin testing and code changes, select one of the plugins from that epic, test it, and propose a pull request to help with this user interface transition.\nIf you’re not comfortable proposing a pull request, describe the problems you see in a bug report.\n\nA tables to divs migration guide is available.\nIt describes areas that typically need to be changed as part of the migration from tables to divs.\nIt also includes detailed examples that allow the plugin to continue supporting older Jenkins versions with table layouts and use div layouts for newer Jenkins versions.\n\nCore - Spring Security replaces Acegi Security\n\nThe Jenkins 2.266 release on November 10, 2020 will include the migration to the Spring Security libraries from the Acegi security libraries that Jesse Glick has proposed and developed through jep:227[Jenkins Enhancement Proposal 227].\n\nThis upgrade replaces the Acegi Security library with the current release of the Spring Security library.\nDetails of the change are described in jep:227[] and in the pull request.\n\nWe need users to test the latest Jenkins weekly releases with their plugins and watch for issues related to authentication.\n\nRefer to Jesse Glick’s blog post that introduces the details of the change and provides links to the Spring Security compatibility table.\nJesse’s blog post provides specific instructions for those who report bugs related to this change.\nPlease use those instructions as you submit bug reports related to the Spring Security upgrade.\n\nCore - XStream unfork\n\nJenkins has been using a fork of the XStream serialization library to read and write XML files.\nThe XStream library was forked over 10 years ago and had a few fixes applied to it.\nUnfortunately, at that time the fixes were rejected by the upstream maintainers of XStream (unsupported patterns of API use) and the fork fell behind the upstream version.\n\nThe Jenkins 2.266 release on November 10, 2020 will include the migration to the upstream version of the XStream library that Jesse Glick has proposed and developed through jep:228[Jenkins Enhancement Proposal 228].\n\nRefer to Jesse Glick’s blog post that introduces the details of the change and provides links to the XStream compatibility table.\nJesse’s blog post provides specific instructions for those who report bugs related to this change.\nPlease use those instructions as you submit bug reports related to the XStream upgrade.\n\nUI - JQuery upgrade\n\nJenkins uses a 1.x version of the jQuery user interface library for some of its components.\nFelix Queiruga has started the work to update that library to a current jQuery version.\n\nIt will arrive in a future Jenkins weekly release.\nWhen it arrives, it will be noted in the Jenkins weekly changelog.\n\nWhen the jQuery update arrives, We will need users to test the Jenkins weekly release with the plugins and configurations that are most important to them.\nWhen users detect an issue, we need them to report the issue with enough detail that a plugin maintainer can fix the issue.\n\nCall to test\n\nThis is a great time to help the Jenkins project by testing the weekly releases.\nWe encourage you to test the user interface and the interactions that are most important to you.\nIf you find an issue, please report the issue so that others can benefit from your discovery.","title":"Jenkins 2.264+: Major changes in the weekly release

article describes our observations during Windows testing of the Jenkins 2.249.1 release candidate.\n\nUpgrade testing\n\nJenkins 2.249.1 is a new long term support release with user interface improvements and changes in Windows support.\nIt is the first long term support release to drop support for Microsoft.NET framework 2.0.\nThe end of support for Microsoft.NET framework 2.0 was announced in the Windows Support Updates blog post.\nThe Windows support upgrade guidelines describe major things to consider when upgrading Jenkins controllers and agents on Windows.\n\nAs part of our preparation for the release, we tested several configurations.\nThis article describes our experiences with those configurations.\n\nUpgrade approaches\n\nWe tested controller and agent upgrades from Jenkins 2.235.x to 2.249.1-rc on Windows.\nThe tests included:\n\n32 bit Windows MSI\n\n64 bit Windows MSI\n\nWAR (file) on Windows\n\nUpgrade process\n\nOur upgrade process included:\n\nInstall a previous version of Jenkins controller on Windows\n\nInstall a previous version of Jenkins agent on Windows and configure it as a service\n\nUpgrade Jenkins controller from \"Manage Jenkins\"\n\nRestart the Jenkins Windows service for the controller\n\nUpgrade the Jenkins agent on Windows with the latest agent.jar\n\nRestart the Jenkins Windows service for the agent\n\nTesting results\n\nWe successfully tested\n\nRestarting Windows service for controller ( JENKINS-63198)\n\nRestarting Windows service for agents ( JENKINS-63223)\n\nWe confirmed that we can continue our Level 1 support policy for Jenkins 2.249.1.\n\n32 bit Windows MSI\n\nPrior to Jenkins 2.235.3, the Jenkins LTS Windows installer was provided as a 32 bit MSI and included a bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\nThe Jenkins agent can be downloaded and run through Java web start using the bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\nThe agent can also be configured to run as a service using the bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\n\nJenkins controller\n\nJenkins 2.235.1 installs JRE 8u144 for 32 bit Windows.\nThe installer configures the Jenkins controller to run as the SYSTEM user.\n\nRefer to the Windows Installer Updates blog post for details of the controller installation process with the 32 bit MSI.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent starts the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent\n\nThe downloaded file needs to be opened from a command prompt using the javaws command that is included with the bundled JRE:\n\nC:\\> \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Jenkins\\jre\\bin\\javaws.exe\" -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nThe javaws program has been removed from  the most recent releases of Java 8 and from Java 11.\nRefer to [Jenkins agent and icedtea] for a technique that can help users of the most recent releases of Java 8.\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is adjusted to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nUpgrade the controller\n\nThe Jenkins controller on Windows can be upgraded to Jenkins 2.249.1 from the \"Manage Jenkins\" page.\nThe upgrade process downloads the new jenkins.war file, saves the current version in case of later downgrade, and offers to restart.\n\nUpgrade the agent\n\nThe Jenkins inbound agent is not upgraded automatically.\nThe agent administrator downloads the most recent agent.jar from their Jenkins controller, stops the running agent, and replaces the installed agent.jar with the downloaded version.\nThe agent service will reconnect to the Jenkins controller after the administrator restarts it.\n\n64 bit Windows MSI\n\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.235.3, the Jenkins LTS Windows installer is a 64 bit MSI.\nIt runs Jenkins with the 64 bit JDK (Java 8 or Java 11) selected by the user.\n\nJenkins controller\n\nJenkins 2.235.3 was installed using AdoptOpenJDK Java 8u262 in one test.\nIt was installed using AdoptOpenJDK Java 11.0.8 in another test.\nIn both cases, the installer configured the Jenkins controller to run with the Windows service account we had previously configured.\n\nRefer to the Windows Installer Updates blog post for details of the controller installation process with the 64 bit MSI.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent was started the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent with IcedTea-Web\n\nRecent versions of Java 8 and all versions of Java 11 have removed the javaws command.\nJenkins agents for Java 8 can still be started with the javaws command, but it needs to be downloaded separately from the JVM.\nWe open \"slave-agent.jnlp\" from a command prompt using the javaws command that is available from AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea :\n\nC:\\> C:\\icedtea-web-1.8.3.win.bin\\icedtea-web-image\\bin\\javaws.exe -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is installed and configured to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nUpgrading the controller\n\nThe Jenkins controller on Windows was upgraded to Jenkins 2.249.1 from the \"Manage Jenkins\" page.\nThe upgrade process downloads the new jenkins.war file, saves the current version in case of later downgrade, and offers to restart.\n\nUpgrading the agent\n\nThe Jenkins inbound agent is not upgraded automatically or from a Jenkins user interface.\nThe agent administrator downloads the most recent agent.jar from their Jenkins controller and replaces the installed agent.jar with the downloaded version.\n\nWAR (file) on Windows\n\nJenkins allows users to run the Jenkins web archive (WAR) file from a command line and then install it as a service from within Jenkins.\nThis installation technique uses the Jenkins WAR file but does not use a Windows MSI package.\nThe Jenkins WAR file includes the necessary components to install and configure Jenkins as a service.\n\nInstall controller as a service\n\nWhen the Jenkins war file is started from a Windows command prompt, \"Manage Jenkins\" includes \"Install as a service\".\nAn administrator selects that entry and Jenkins will configure itself to run as a service/\nThe installer configures the Jenkins controller to run as the SYSTEM user.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nAfter opening the Jenkins TCP port for inbound agents, we configured a new agent from the \"Nodes\" menu\nThis created an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent was started the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent with IcedTea-Web\n\nRecent versions of Java 8 and all versions of Java 11 have removed the javaws command.\nJenkins agents for Java 8 can still be started with the javaws command, but it needs to be downloaded separately from the JVM.\nOpen \"slave-agent.jnlp\" from a command prompt using the javaws command that is available from AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea-Web :\n\nC:\\> C:\\icedtea-web-1.8.3.win.bin\\icedtea-web-image\\bin\\javaws.exe -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is installed and configured to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nConclusion\n\nJenkins controller installation is best done with the new 64 bit MSI package.\nPrevious controller installations can be upgraded to the most recent Jenkins release from within Jenkins.\n\nJenkins inbound agent installation is more complicated now that the javaws.exe program is not included in the JDK.\nThe AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea-Web project allows administrators to install and configure Jenkins inbound agents with most of the ease that was available in prior Java releases.","title":"Testing Jenkins 2.249.1 on

is not glamorous, but it is goodness.\n\n— Thomas Otter\n\nJenkins technical documentation is an important part of our project as it is key to using Jenkins well.\nGood documentation guides users and encourages good implementation choices.\nIt is a crucial part of the user experience.\n\nIn the recent Jenkins UI/UX hackfest, documentation was a specific track to improve the Jenkins user experience.\nWe received many improvements from experienced Jenkins contributors and newcomers alike.\nContributors from all around the world submitted pull requests for documentation on installing, managing, administering, and operating Jenkins.\n\nDocumentation migration from Wiki\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki pages have collected 15 years of experience and wisdom for Jenkins users.\nHowever, that experience and wisdom is intermixed with inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated information.\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki migration project identified the 50 most accessed pages on the Jenkins wiki and created GitHub issues to track the migration of those pages to www.jenkins.io.\nThis was our first large scale experiment using GitHub issues for documentation.\nThe results have been overwhelmingly positive.\nHackfest contributors added new sections to many documentation chapters, including:\n\nUsing Jenkins\n\nPipeline\n\nManaging Jenkins\n\nSystem Administration\n\nThe Hackfest closed 19 of the wiki migration issues.\nWork is in progress on an additional 25 wiki migration issues.\nWe’ve made great progress and look forward to even better results in the future.\nNew contributors used the \"good first issue\" label very effectively.\nWe started the Hackfest with most of the 25 \"good first issues\" unassigned and completed the Hackfest with 14 closed and 10 others in progress.\nWe’ll provide more \"good first issues\" as we use the Jenkins Wiki migration to welcome new documentation contributors.\n\nMigrating plugin documentation\n\nPlugin documentation is also in transition.\nSince November 2019, plugins have been moving their documentation into the GitHub repository that hosts the plugin source code.\nThis\"documentation as code\" approach allows plugin maintainers to include documentation improvements in the same pull requests that implement new capabilities.\nIt assures that documentation changes are reviewed by the same maintainers who review and approve new capabilities.\n\nHackfest participants submitted pull requests to migrate plugin documentation to GitHub.\n10 plugin pull requests are in progress from the Hackfest.\n5 plugin pull requests from the Hackfest have been already merged and are awaiting the release of the plugin.\n\nChuck Norris uses documentation as code\n\nIn the spirit of fun and adventure, Oleg Nenashev migrated the \"Chuck Norris plugin\" to GitHub documentation as code in a live Hackfest presentation May 26, 2020.\nLinks to the recording, the plugin migration guide, and the export tool are available from\"Migrating plugins to documentation-as-code\".\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nJenkins works with other technologies to solve automation challenges in many different environments.\nWe describe those environments in our\"Solution Pages\".\nAs part of the Hackfest, we’ve started a series of improvements to the solution pages.\n\nThe Docker solutions page now includes updated videos and a better page layout for easier reading and better navigation.\nOther solution pages will receive similar improvements in the future.\n\nSystem properties\n\nThe global configuration of Jenkins can be modified at startup by defining Java properties.\nSystem properties can change system defaults and can provide compatibility \"escape hatches\" when a new default configuration might be incompatible with existing installations.\n\nDaniel Beck has improved the navigation and user experience of the system properties page as part of the Hackfest.\nIt is now much easier to read and to reference, with embeddable links available with a mouse-over to the right of every property and labels that categorize and classify each property.\n\nPlugin site improvements\n\nDuring the Hackfest, Gavin Mogan has continued his efforts to improve the Jenkins Plugins Site so that users can easily access plugin changelogs and reported issues.\nOnce this pull request is merged, it will greatly improve the experience of those Jenkins users who want to update plugins and look for documentation about what has changed in them and what are the possible issues they might experience.\n\nExample of the incoming UI for the Jira plugin:\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThere is still much to do in Jenkins documentation and we need your help to do it.\nThere are many ways to participate in the Jenkins project, including documentation.\nSee the contributing guidelines for detailed instructions.\nJoin the documentation chat for personalized help and encouragement.\n\nThe Jenkins project has been also accepted to Google Season of Docs this year.\nThis open-source mentorship program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nWe are looking for technical writers who are interested to contribute to the project in September-December 2020.\nIt is a great opportunity to study Documentation-as-code tools and to learn more about contributing to open-source projects.\nYou can find Jenkins project ideas and more information here.","title":"Jenkins User Experience Hackfest Documentation

of the things we loved about going to developer conferences was meeting Jenkins users — newbies and old-timers alike — who are excited to talk about their projects and share tips on how to move forward using Jenkins.\nSince the coronavirus pandemic, we’re learning to rely more on new ways to gather, and it’s happening via Jenkins online meetups, GitHub collaborations, and Twitter threads, to name a few.\n\nIt’s a significant change.\nBut what hasn’t changed is the need to share stories about the things users have built, the solutions they’ve developed, and the excellent results they’re getting from some really innovative Jenkins implementations.\nThen we wondered, why isn’t anyone collecting these user stories and sharing them with the Jenkins community.\n\nIntroducing Jenkins is the Way\n\nSo we took the first step to record and archive all the great stuff everyone in our community is building with Jenkins.\nThis way, Jenkins users old and new can come to an archive and search for Jenkins solutions for inspiration.\nWe foresee a vast library of solutions from all around the world, solving a wide array of challenges in every industry imaginable.\nWe decided to call this archive \" Jenkins Is The Way\" and host it at https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io.\n\nTo aggregate all these stories, we built a simple online questionnaire so that Jenkins users can submit their own experience using this leading open source automation server.\nWith so many plugins to support building, deploying, and automating your projects, we expect to see a vast collection of stories.\n\nWe’ve already received a handful, including stories that illustrate how Jenkins Is The Way :\n\nto code your own release pipelines\n\nto cast magic of continuous delivery\n\nto understand and simplify your software lifecycle\n\nto accelerate automation in the cloud\n\nto facilitate day-to-day work\n\nAdd your story. Show your Jenkins pride. Get our T-shirt\n\nBe an inspiration to the Jenkins community by sharing your Jenkins story.\nJust go to this link and fill out the form.\nWe’ll ask you about your project’s goals, the technical challenges you overcame with Jenkins, and the solutions you created.\nIt should take no more than 20-30 minutes to complete.\n\nWe’ll clean it up for clarity and publish it on https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io.\n\nOnce it’s part of our archive, we’ll send you our new 2020 Jenkins Is the Way t-shirt.\n\nAnd since the more, the merrier, please share this blog post with peers and colleagues.\nWe want to hear everyone’s stories about the clever ways Jenkins is used to automate all that we need to do.\n\nThanks and Acknowledgement\n\nSpecial thanks to abConsulting for creating and managing the https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io site and for reviewing, editing, and publishing the submitted stories.\n\nThanks to the Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG for their reviews and feedback.\n\nThanks also to CloudBees for sponsoring the \" Jenkins is the Way\" program.","title":"Call for User Stories - Jenkins is the Way","tags":["announcement","outreach-programs","advocacy-and-outreach","jenkins-is-the-way"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp;
