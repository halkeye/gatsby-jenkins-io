To understand how to configure credentials in a Jenkins environment: Using Credentials\n\ngitToolName\n\nName of the git installation in the machine running the Jenkins instance\n(Check Global Tool Configuration section in Jenkins UI)\n\nNote: In case a user is not aware of the git tool installation of the particular machine, the default git installation will be chosen.\n\nExamples\n\nThe withCredentials wrapper allows declarative and scripted Pipeline jobs to perform authenticated command line git operations with sh , bat , and powershell tasks.\n\nShell example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  sh 'git fetch --all'\n}\n\nBatch example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  bat 'git submodule update --init --recursive'\n}\n\nPowershell example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  powershell 'git push'\n}\n\nThe Pipeline Syntax Snippet Generator is a good way to explore the syntax of the withCredentials step and the git username / password credentials binding.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe git credentials username / password binding has been tested on command line git versions 1.8.3 through 2.32.0.\nIt has been tested on CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Debian 9, Debian 10, FreeBSD 12, OpenBSD 6.9, openSUSE 15.2, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 21.04, and Windows 10.\nProcessor testing has included amd64, arm32, arm64, and s390x.\n\nThe binding does not support private key credentials.\nThe binding is not supported on command line git versions prior to 1.8.3.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nPrivate key credentials support is coming soon.","title":"Git username / password credentials binding","tags":["git"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"markewaite","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Mark is the <a href=\"/project/team-leads/#documentation\">Jenkins Documentation Officer</a>, a long-time Jenkins user and contributor, and maintains the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/git\">git plugin</a> and the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client\">git client plugin</a>.\nHe is active in <a href=\"/sigs/\">Jenkins special interest groups</a> including the <a href=\"/sigs/docs/\">Docs SIG</a>, <a href=\"/sigs/platform\">Platform SIG</a>, and <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach\">Advocacy SIG</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"markewaite","irc":"markewaite","linkedin":"markwaite","name":"Mark Waite","slug":"/blog/author/markewaite","twitter":"MarkEWaite"},{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"rishabhBudhouliya","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2020 student under the Jenkins project (Git Plugin Performance Improvements).\nAspiring to be better at Software Development and participate more in the open source\ncommunity.</p>\n</div>","id":"rishabhbudhouliya","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rishabh Budhouliya","slug":"/blog/author/rishabhbudhouliya","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2021-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9f9a3a5e-47db-53de-a9b4-6390afba35fe","slug":"/blog/2021/06/17/libera-chat/","strippedHtml":"We are happy to announce that\nthe Jenkins community has moved all its official IRC channels to Libera chat.\nWe have started our migration on May 26 as a response to the\nhostile takeover\nof hundreds of open source community channel by the new Freenode management.\nAs decided  by the Jenkins governance meeting on June 16th,\nLibera Chat IRC channels are the only official channels going forward.\n\nA more detailed history of the transition is available on the Jenkins developers mailing list.\n\nWhat did we move?\n\nWe have created the following IRC chats:\n\nthat currently live on freenode to libera.chat:\n\n#jenkins - general discussion channel for Jenkins users and developers.\nWe no longer consider it a central chat for all things Jenkins, but we intend to keep it available to users\nwho want to keep using IRC.\n\n#jenkins-hosting - Chat used by the Hosting Team to manage hosting automation\n\n#jenkins-infra - Chat used by the Infrastructure Team to coordinate efforts related to Jenkins project infrastructure and the incident response\n\n#jenkins-release - Chat used for Jenkins core release coordination by the Release Team\n\nAll other channels have NOT been moved to Libera Chat IRC and were replaced by other channels.\nMost notable channels:\n\n#jenkins-meeting - the Jenkins Governance Meeting uses combination of Zoom and Google Docs at the moment. We do not longer use the IRC chat for that purpose.\n\n#jenkins-cert - no private chat going forward. The Security Team will use mailing lists only going forward\n\n#jenkins-community - Replaced by the Advocacy&Outreach Gitter channel.\n\nFreenode concerns and disclaimers\n\nGoing forward, the Jenkins community does not have ANY official channels on Freenode.\nAll channels are either removed or left abandoned.\nWe no longer manage or control our channels.\nMost of the Jenkins IRC channel operators use IRCCloud,\nand hence they were banned by the Freenode team on June 11th.\nOnly a few operators have reconnected since this event.\n\nTaking the takeover of Freenode and hostile actions taken by the new management,\nwe can no longer guarantee any of the following:\n\nAuthenticity of registered users on Freenode.\nAll IRC accounts, cloaked or not, might have been taken over by the new Freenode management.\n Do not trust messages from the Jenkins contributor account IDs there.\n\nConfidentiality of private channels like #jenkins-cert.\nWe performed audit of the conversations there, and we believe there are no undisclosed security vulnerabilities referenced in the channel.\n After all, this IRC has been rather dormant for the last 18 months.\n\nIRC User Passwords.\nAll passwords on Freenode IRC may be compromised in the future.\nWe strongly advise all users to rotate their passwords if they were used on Freenode IRC.\n\nWe have made backups of IRC channel conversations in the abandoned channels.\nIf you need to access the conversation history, please reach out to the Jenkins Infrastructure team.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the entire Libera Chat team and all contributors who have worked on creating\na Freenode replacement for hundreds of open source communities using IRC.\nWithin just a month, a new platform has been created and adopted by almost all active projects.\nWe remember the Hudson to Jenkins renaming days when a similar mobilization happened in the Jenkins community,\nand we appreciate all the effort put by contributors.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels\nand our automation like the IRC Bot used by the Jenkins hosting team.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn the Jenkins community we will keep using Libera Chat IRC and maintaining user and contributor channels there.\nOther Jenkins chat channels like Gitter and Slack are unchanged.\nWe intend to gradually replace many of those channels with community.jenkins.io.\nThis is a new portal powered by Discourse.\nThe service is sponsored by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc..\nIt is currently in preview, stay tuned for announcements.\nAs always, we will appreciate any suggestions and [feedback]( https://community.jenkins.io/c/site-feedback/2)!","title":"Jenkins IRC moves to

examples and create Pipeline help for Jenkins Pipeline plugins.\nParticipants will learn more about Jenkins Pipeline and will submit plugin pull requests with examples and online help.\n\nThe Jenkins Pipeline Steps Reference and Pipeline online help often receive feedback that more examples are needed, that step return values need to be described, and that arguments need more description of their purpose, allowed values, and expected results.\nMost plugin maintainers do not provide detailed documentation of the pipeline steps, or the arguments to those pipeline steps.\nThis project will improve the documentation of pipeline steps and their arguments while introducing Jenkins Pipeline, Jenkins plugin development, Jenkins documentation as code, and the concepts of GitHub forks and pull requests.\n\nWe’ve identified development tasks that up to three Contributhon participants will complete during April.\nThe tasks will introduce the participants to Jenkins plugin development.\nThey will experiment with plugin changes in Jenkins and submit pull requests to provide Pipeline examples and help.\nThey will meet twice a week with Jenkins mentors, Kristin Whetstone, Mark Waite, and Meg McRoberts to review their progress, provide coaching, and help with issues.\n\nData driven choices\n\nWe’ve been collecting Jenkins documentation feedback since 2017.\nNow we’re using that feedback to

help shape the future of Jenkins.\nIn the Jenkins community we value all types and sizes of contributions and love to welcome new participants.\n\nFormat\n\nThe online format allows greater flexibility for meeting times and topics.\nContributors will meet to discuss specific topics in smaller groups at times that are convenient for those in the meeting.\n\nOpening session\n\nThe opening session will start Tuesday, February 23, 2021 at 15:00 UTC.\nAfter an initial welcome and overview, we’ll hear from leaders in the Jenkins project as they share the results from the previous 12 months and outline ideas for the next 12 months.\n\nSecurity - Daniel Beck\n\nInfrastructure - Olivier Vernin\n\nRelease - Tim Jacomb\n\nUser experience - Félix Queiruga\n\nChinese localization - 赵晓杰(Rick)\n\nConfiguration as code - Tim Jacomb\n\nGoogle Summer of Code - Kara de la Marck\n\nDocumentation - Mark Waite\n\nEvents and Advocacy - Alyssa Tong\n\nCloud Native - Kara de la Marck\n\nPlatforms - Mark Waite\n\nAfter those presentations, we’ll create \"breakout rooms\" in the online meeting that will allow those interested in specific tracks to meet, identify preferred times for their tracks, and prepare draft agendas for their tracks.\n\nTracks\n\nSmaller sessions (\"tracks\") will be run in the 48 hour period between the opening session and the closing session.\nThese smaller sessions will be focused on specific topics.\nA track leader will organize the track meeting, facilitate discussions in the track meeting, and present a summary of the track results in the closing session.\n\nClosing session\n\nThe opening session will start Thursday, February 25, 2021 at 15:00 UTC.\nAfter an initial welcome and overview, we’ll hear from track leaders as they share the results from their track meetings.\n\nWe’ll identify items that should be added to the Jenkins roadmap, items that should be further investigated by special interest groups, and items that need further discussion elsewhere.","title":"Jenkins Contributor Summit Online Feb

with Jenkins 2.279 and Jenkins 2.263.4, the Jenkins project is upgrading the base operating system and Java version used in the jenkins/jenkins:latest and jenkins/jenkins:lts images.\nThe update replaces OpenJDK 8u242 with AdoptOpenJDK 8u282 and replaces Debian 9 (\"Stretch\") with Debian 10 (\"Buster\").\n\nWhy?\n\nWe’re changing the base image so that we have a better supported operating system and a more current Java release for Jenkins controllers.\n\nBetter supported operating system\n\nThe Docker images provided by the Jenkins project rely on the operating system security processes of the operating system provider.\n\nOur Docker images have used Debian 9 (\"Stretch\") for multiple years.\nDebian 9 security updates have been discontinued as of July 6, 2020.\nDebian 9 Long Term Support security updates will be discontinued at the end of June 2022.\nThe upgrade to Debian 10 keeps us on an operating system maintained by the operating system security team.\n\nMore current Java release\n\nThe Debian 9 Docker images were based on the openjdk:8-jdk-stretch Docker image.\nThe last update to that image was one year ago with the release of JDK 8u242.\nWe need a maintained Docker base image that keeps pace with JDK releases and operating system updates so that the controller is running the most recent Java updates and most recent operating system updates.\n\nOther Jenkins controller images have already switched from using openjdk base images to instead use base images provided by Eclipse Adoptium.\nEclipse Adoptium is the Eclipse project formed when AdoptOpenJDK joined the Eclipse Foundation.\nThis change adapts the jenkins/jenkins:latest and jenkins/jenkins:lts images to use the Adoptium JDK images in the same pattern as is already used for the Jenkins JDK 11 Docker images like jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11.\nThe Jenkins Platform SIG has enjoyed very good results in our interactions with the Eclipse Adoptium project.\nWe look forward to continuing our collaboration with them.\n\nThanks a lot to Alex Earl and Jim Crowley for the image build restructuring groundwork that made the image upgrade possible!\nAlso thanks to Oleg Nenashev and other contributors for their reviews and testing.\n\nPackaging changes\n\nThe Jenkins Docker image based on Debian 10 (\"Buster\") includes some different packages than Debian 9 (\"Stretch\").\nSome packages have been removed because they are no longer supported by their communities.\nSome packages have been removed due to infrequent and decreasing use.\nUsers of the Jenkins Docker images may need to extend their definition of their Docker image to include packages that are no longer included in the base image.\n\nSCM packages removed\n\nThe following source control management packages are no longer included in the Jenkins controller images for jenkins/jenkins:latest or for jenkins/jenkins:lts :\n\nbzr\n\nmercurial\n\nsubversion\n\nOther packages removed\n\nAdditional packages that are no longer included in the Jenkins controller images include:\n\nbzip2\n\nmime-support\n\npython (the Python project stopped supporting Python 2 January 1, 2020)\n\nxz-utils\n\nA detailed list of the exact package changes is available in the pull request.\n\nUpgrade and compatibility notes\n\nThe Jenkins controller images are designed to be extended to meet user needs.\nCustom Jenkins controller images can be created from the base images and are designed to allow additional Jenkins plugins and additional operating system packages.\n\nFor example, the Installing Docker instructions illustrate a technique to install the Blue Ocean plugins and some operating system packages in a custom Docker image.\n\nDocker image with Subversion\n\nThe following Docker image definition installs the most recent Jenkins Long Term Support release with the subversion plugin and the operating system subversion command:\n\nFROM jenkins/jenkins:lts\nUSER root\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends subversion\nUSER jenkins\nRUN jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins subversion:2.14.0\n\nBuild a new docker image from this Dockerfile and assign the image a meaningful name, e.g. \"myjenkins-subversion:1.1\":\n\ndocker build -t myjenkins-subversion:1.1 .\n\nDocker image with Mercurial\n\nThe following Docker image definition installs the most recent Jenkins Weekly release with the mercurial plugin and the operating system hg command:\n\nFROM jenkins/jenkins:latest\nUSER root\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends mercurial\nUSER jenkins\nRUN jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins mercurial:2.12\n\nBuild a new docker image from this Dockerfile and assign the image a meaningful name, e.g. \"myjenkins-mercurial:1.1\":\n\ndocker build -t myjenkins-mercurial:1.1 .\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe will continue Docker image updates as new Java versions are released.\n\nIf you are interested in new features in Jenkins Docker packaging,\nstay tuned for future announcements!\nThere are multiple ongoing initiatives which you can find on the public Jenkins roadmap.\nSome stories:\n\nSwitching to AdoptOpenJDK.\n\nGeneral availability of Windows images.\n\nSupport for more platforms (AArch64, IBM s390x, PowerPC).\n\nIntroducing multi-platform Docker images.\n\nIf you are interested in any of these projects and would like to contribute,\nplease reach out to the Platform Special Interest Group which coordinates initiatives related to Jenkins in Docker.","title":"Docker image updates","tags":["announcement","docker","platform-sig"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"markewaite","html":"<div
