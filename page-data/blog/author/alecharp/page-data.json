is a joint blog post prepared by the Java 11 Support Team: Adrien Lecharpentier, Ashton Treadway, Baptiste Mathus, Jenn Briden, Kevin Earls, María Isabel Vilacides, Mark Waite, Ramón León and Oleg Nenashev.\n\nWe have worked hard for this and it’s now here.\nWe are thrilled to announce full support for Java 11 in Jenkins starting from Jenkins 2.164 (released on Feb 10, 2019) and LTS 2.164.1 (ETA: March 14th).\nThis means you can now run your Jenkins controllers and agents with a Java 11 JVM.\n\nStarting in June 2018, many events were organized to improve Jenkins code base and add Java 11 support.\nBeyond these events, Core/Plugins maintainers and many other contributors have worked hard to make sure they discover and solve as many issues as possible related to Java 11 support.\n\nThe effort to support Java 11 led to the creation of the JEP-211: Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nIt also spurred the creation of the Platform Special Interest Group to coordinate the Java 11 work and other platform support efforts.\n\nCelebration\n\nWe’d like to take a moment to thank everyone involved in these tasks: code contributors, issue reporters, testers, event planners and attendees and all those in the community who have generously lent their time and support to this effort.\nThank you all!\n\nHere are some of the contributors who helped with this task (alphabetical order):\n\nAlex Earl,\nAlyssa Tong,\nAshton Treadway,\nBaptiste Mathus,\nCarlos Sanchez,\nDaniel Beck,\nDavid Aldrich,\nDenis Digtyar,\nDevin Nusbaum,\nEmeric Vernat,\nEvaristo Gutierrez,\nGavin Mogan,\nGianpaolo Macario,\nIsabel Vilacides,\nJames Howe,\nJeff Pearce,\nJeff Thompson,\nJenn Briden,\nJesse Glick,\nJonah Graham,\nKevin Earls,\nKsenia Nenasheva,\nKohsuke Kawaguchi,\nLiam Newman,\nMandy Chung,\nMark Waite,\nNicolas De Loof,\nOleg Nenashev,\nOliver Gondža,\nOlivier Lamy,\nOlivier Vernin,\nParker Ennis,\nPaul Sandoz,\nRamón León,\nSam Van Oort,\nTobias Getrost,\nTracy Miranda,\nUlli Hafner,\nVincent Latombe,\nWadeck Follonier\n\n(We are deeply sorry if we missed anyone in this list.)\n\nGuidelines\n\nIn order to keep it simple, here is how you can start Jenkins on Java 11 using the Docker image.\nYou can select a Java 11 based image by suffixing the tag of the image with -jdk11.\nIf you are upgrading an existing instance please read the Upgrading Jenkins Java version from 8 to 11 page before upgrading.\n\nSo you can run Jenkins on Java 11 with:\n\ndocker run -p 50000:50000 -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:2.164-jdk11\n\nHowever, and as always, you can still start Jenkins with other methods.\nPlease see the more detailed documentation at Running Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nDeveloper guidelines\n\nFor developers involved in Jenkins development, you can find details on developing and testing Jenkins to run on Java 11 on the Java 11 Developer Guidelines.\n\nThis resource regroups the modifications which might need to be done in order to validate the compatibility of plugins for Java 11.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nEven though this is a big achievement, we still have work to do.\n\nOur first priority is adding Java 11 support to JenkinsFile Runner project.\nFrom there, we will move on to port Java 11 support to the Jenkins X project and the Evergreen project.\n\nSo, even if this is a big deal to us, this is not the end of the story.\nIt is a major step that will benefit users, developers, and members of the Jenkins community.\n\nReference links\n\nRunning Jenkins on Java
