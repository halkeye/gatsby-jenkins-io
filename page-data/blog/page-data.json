common CI/CD use-cases a lot of the space is consumed by test reports.\nThis data is stored within JENKINS_HOME,\nand the current storage format requires huge overheads when retrieving statistics and, especially, trends.\nIn order to display trends, each report has to be loaded and then processed in-memory.\n\nThe main purpose of externalising Test Results is to optimize Jenkins performance and storage\nby querying the desired data from external storages.\n\nI’m please to announce that the JUnit Plugin external storage is now available for use.\n\nGetting started\n\nInstall your database vendor specific plugin, you can use the Jenkins plugin site to search for it:\n\nhttps://plugins.jenkins.io/ui/search/?labels=database\n\ne.g. you could install the PostgreSQL Database plugin.\n\nWe currently support PostgreSQL or MySQL, but can support others, just create an issue or send a pull request.\n\nFrom Jenkins UI\n\nNavigate to: Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Junit\n\nIn the dropdown select 'SQL Database'\n\nNow configure your Database connection details.\n\nSearch for 'Global Database' on the same 'Configure System' page.\n\nSelect the database implementation you want to use and click 'Test Connection' to verify Jenkins can connect\n\nClick 'Save'\n\nConfiguration as code\n\nIf you want to configure the plugin via Configuration as Code then see the below sample:\n\nunclassified:\n  globalDatabaseConfiguration:\n    database:\n      postgreSQL:\n        database: \"jenkins\"\n        hostname: \"${DB_HOST_NAME}\"\n        password: \"${DB_PASSWORD}\"\n        username: \"${DB_USERNAME}\"\n        validationQuery: \"SELECT 1\"\n  junitTestResultStorage:\n    storage: \"database\"\n\nUsing the plugin\n\nNow run some builds, here’s an example pipeline configuration to get you started if you’re just trying out the plugin:\n\nnode {\n  writeFile file: 'x.xml', text: '''\n\n'''\n  junit 'x.xml'\n}\n\nYou will see a test result trend appear like below on the builds project page:\n\nIf you check on the controller’s file system you will see no junitResult.xml for new builds.\n\nIf you connect to your database and run:\n\nSELECT * FROM caseresults;\n\nYou will see a number of test results in the database.\n\nWhat happens to existing test results?\n\nExisting test results will stay on disk but will not be loaded.\n\nCurrently there is no migration scripts or plugin functionality to do this, if you need it then please raise an issue.\n\nHow are test results cleaned up\n\nWhen a job or build is deleted the related test results are removed.\n\nThis is expected to be done as part of a 'Build Discarder'.\n\nIf you wish to keep your results longer than this you can disable this feature by enabling:\n\nSkip cleanup of test result on build deletion on the system configuration page.\n\nIf you need more complex cleanup strategies built into the plugin then please raise an issue.\n\nAPI\n\nThe API is defined at:\n\njenkinsdoc:junit:io.jenkins.plugins.junit.storage.JunitTestResultStorage[]\n\njenkinsdoc:junit:io.jenkins.plugins.junit.storage.JunitTestResultStorageDescriptor[]\n\njenkinsdoc:junit:io.jenkins.plugins.junit.storage.TestResultImpl[]\n\nJunitTestResultStorage#load is passed a job name and build which can be used to construct an instance of the external storage implementation.\n\nThis implementation will then act on that job and build except for the optimised calls that act across all builds.\n\nThe API contains the basic methods like getFailCount, getSkipCount, but also APIs that are optimised for retrieving data for the trend graphs on the job page and the test result history page.\n\nThese allow single API calls to be made for what used to be a lot of work for Jenkins to look up before.\n\nFeedback\n\nI would love to hear your feedback & suggestions for this feature.\n\nPlease create an issue at https://github.com/jenkinsci/junit-plugin or provide feedback on https://community.jenkins.io","title":"Introducing external storage for

Pipeline (or simply Pipeline with a capital P) is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.\nThis allows you to automate the process of getting software from version control through to your users and customers.\n\nPipeline code works beautifully for its intended role of automating build, test, deploy, and administration tasks.\nBut, as it is pressed into more complex roles and unexpected uses, some users have run into snags.\nUsing best practices – and avoiding common mistakes – can help you design a pipeline that is more robust, scalable, and high-performing.\n\nWe see a lot of users making basic mistakes that can sabotage their pipeline.\n(Yes, you can sabotage yourself when you’re creating a pipeline.)\nIn fact, it’s easy to spot someone who is going down this dangerous path – and it’s usually because they don’t understand some key technical concepts about Pipeline.\nThis invariably leads to scalability mistakes that you’ll pay dearly for down the line.\n\nDon’t make this mistake!\n\nPerhaps the biggest misstep people make is deciding that they need to write their entire pipeline in a programming language.\nAfter all, Pipeline is a domain specific language (DSL).\nHowever, that does not mean that it is a general-purpose programming language.\n\nIf you treat the DSL as a general-purpose programming language, you are making a serious architectural blunder by doing the wrong work in the wrong place.\nRemember that the core of Pipeline code runs on the controller.\nSo, you should be mindful that everything you express in the Pipeline domain specific language (DSL) will compete with every other Jenkins job running on the controller.\n\nFor example, it’s easy to include a lot of conditionals, flow control logic, and requests using scripted syntax in the pipeline job.\nExperience tells us this is not a good idea and can result in serious damage to pipeline performance.\nWe’ve actually seen organizations with poorly written Pipeline jobs bring a controller to its knees, while only running a few concurrent builds.\n\nWait a minute, you might ask, “Isn’t handling code what the controller is there for?”\nYes, the controller certainly is there to execute pipelines.\nBut, it’s much better to assign individual steps of the pipeline to command line calls that execute on an agent.\nSo, instead of running a lot of conditionals inside the pipeline DSL, it’s better to put those conditionals inside a shell script or batch file and call that script from the pipeline.\n\nHowever, this raises another question: “What if I don’t have any agents connected to my controller?”\nIf this is the case, then you’ve just made another bad mistake in scaling Jenkins pipelines.\nWhy? Because the first rule of building an effective pipeline is to make sure you use agents.\nIf you’re using a Jenkins controller and haven’t defined any agents, then your first step should be to define at least one agent and use that agent instead of executing on the controller.\n\nFor the sake of maintaining scalability in your pipeline, the general rule is to avoid processing any workload on your controller.\nIf you’re running Jenkins jobs on the controller, you are sacrificing controller performance.\nSo, try to avoid using Jenkins controller capacity for things that should be passed off to an agent.\nThen, as you grow and develop, all of your work should be running agents.\nThis is why we always recommend setting the number of executors on the master to zero.\n\nUse Just Enough Pipeline to Keep Your Pipeline Scalable\n\nAll of this serves to highlight our overarching theme of “using just enough pipeline.”\nSimply put, you want to use enough code to connect the pipeline steps and integrate tools – but no more than that.\nLimit the amount of complex logic embedded in the Pipeline itself (similarly to a shell script), and avoid treating it as a general-purpose programming language.\nThis makes the pipeline easier to maintain, protects against bugs, and reduces the load on controllers.\n\nAnother best practice for keeping your pipeline lean, fast, and scalable is to use declarative syntax instead of scripted syntax for your Pipeline.\nDeclarative naturally leads you away from the kinds of mistakes we’ve just described.\nIt is a simpler expression of code and an easier way to define your job.\nIt’s computed at the startup of the pipeline instead of executing continually during the pipeline.\n\nTherefore, when creating a pipeline, start with declarative, and keep it simple for as long as possible.\nAnytime a script block shows up inside of a declarative pipeline, you should extract that block and put it in a shared library step.\nThat keeps the declarative pipeline clean.\nBy combining declarative with a shared library, that will take care of the vast majority of use cases you’ll encounter.\n\nThat said, it’s not accurate to say that declarative plus a shared library will solve every problem.\nThere are cases where scripted is the right solution.\nHowever, declarative is a great starting point until you discover that you absolutely must use scripted.\n\nJust remember, at the end of the day, you’ll do well to follow the adage: “Use just enough pipeline and no more.”\n\nThanks to our Sponsor\n\nMark and Darin both work

are many ways to set up your Jenkins environment, and depending on the configuration you choose, there are different best practices and options to optimize your environment.\nIn this blog, I’m going to focus on Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees as a way to fine-tune your environment.\nIt’s a free tool that can help administrators understand and manage their Jenkins controller.\nIf you’re a CloudBees customer, the tool automatically comes with CloudBees CI.\nHowever, it’s also available as a free open source tool to anyone who uses Jenkins.\nThe Jenkins Health Advisor tool can make your life easier, because it can arm you with the information you need to keep your Jenkins environment running smoothly.\n\nA Bit of Background\n\nThe CloudBees support team originally created the tool as a way to help customers troubleshoot Jenkins issues.\nWith the tool, our support engineers could gather information from a customer’s Jenkins controller about the configuration of the controller and agents, the operating system, stats from web requests, and the like.\nOur tech support teams used this data to help customers pinpoint problems, such as security vulnerabilities, performance problems, and plugin version issues.\nVery quickly, our support tooling team saw the bigger-picture benefits of the diagnostic tool as an opportunity for people to proactively manage their controller.\nWith that bit of background, let’s dive into the Jenkins Health Advisor tool so you understand how it can help you.\n\nThe Problem — Lack of Visibility into Controller Environment\n\nBecause of the open-source nature of Jenkins and the vast array of plugins that you can deploy in your Jenkins installation, downstream code changes to plugins and corresponding dependencies can inadvertently impact your environment, which slows productivity, causes confusion, and impacts the quality of your software delivery.\nWhen problems arise, Jenkins administrators need to quickly pinpoint the root cause of an issue, and that can be quite a challenge.\n\nThe Solution — Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees\n\nWhen an issue arises, you need razor sharp insight to help you quickly sift through lines upon lines of data about your Jenkins controller and your plugins to identify the problem.\nAnd, that’s exactly what Jenkins Health Advisor does.\nIt gives you specific information about potential problems in your environment so you can resolve issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen you first install the Jenkins Health Advisor tool in your environment, you’ll receive a report that lists everything it detects in your system.\nYou’ll then receive report emails only when something changes that could impact your environment or when the tool identifies an issue that could be problematic.\nIf there are no issues in your environment, you don’t receive an email.\nIt’s really that simple.\n\nThe Power is in the Insight … and the CloudBees Support\n\nOk, so let’s explain how Jenkins Health Advisor uses data to help you optimize your environment.\nThe tool actually generates a support bundle every 24 hours.\nWe don’t want to bog down your email inbox with redundant reports emails, so we don’t send every report to you—only the reports that indicate an issue with your environment.\nHowever, CloudBees receives every support bundle from every user.\nWe are constantly monitoring all of this active Jenkins controller data with external Jenkins and open source data about known issues, plugin updates, security vulnerabilities, etc.\nIf the Jenkins Health Advisor tool identifies an issue that could impact your system, you’ll receive an email so you can proactively address the problem.\nAt the same time, CloudBees engineering teams are continually working to enhance the detection capabilities of the Jenkins Health Advisor tool, so you can work as proactively as possible to manage your environment.\n\nThe emails you receive identify potential problems, and they also include supporting information to help you resolve issues, with links to solutions and recommended resolutions as well as articles to understand the problem.\n\nHelpful Tips to Gain Value from Jenkins Health Advisor\n\nImprove Troubleshooting\n\nIf you need to troubleshoot a particular issue, you can manually generate a support bundle to give you point-in-time information on your environment.\nYou can filter the support bundle data on different system parameters, like the build queue, dump agent export tables, and garbage collection logs, so you get the specific information you need.\n\nGenerate Anonymized System Data\n\nAt any time, you can change the settings on your tool to anonymize the data in your support bundles.\nYou may want to do this if you don’t want to share sensitive project data with CloudBees.\nOur support and engineering teams can still gain valuable insight from your generic system data.\nThis is also a helpful feature if you need to share system data with a partner or vendor, and you don’t want to share project or personnel data.\n\nJenkins Health Advisor Tool Updates and Support\n\nAs we mentioned above, the CloudBees support tooling team is constantly working to enhance the tool.\nTo ensure it’s always as current as possible, we release updates to the tool every two weeks.\nUsually these updates won’t impact your Jenkins environment.\nHowever, if there are changes to the tool that might affect your system, you’ll receive a notification email so there are no surprises.\nAnd, if you need help with the Jenkins Health Advisor tool, our support engineers are available to answer your questions.\n\nStart Using Jenkins Health Advisor Today\n\nGiven the vast Jenkins community, it’s impossible to know everything that may impact your environment, even if you look at your control panel every day and scour open source forums on a regular basis to stay on top of new issues and vulnerabilities.\nThe Jenkins Health Advisor tool is designed to streamline the work effort of your daily routine by automatically telling you when there’s an issue that may impact your Jenkins environment.\nWith the proactive Jenkins Health Advisor notifications, you can spend your time on more strategic tasks.\n\nInstall the plugin and enroll your controller with Jenkins Health Advisor today!","title":"Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees Tool Makes Life Easier for Jenkins
