It was an experiment to let\nplugins be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main\nJava Virtual Machine runtime with help of JRuby.\nA similar extension was made to allow plugins to be written in Python but still integrated into the Java Virtual Machine with Jython.\n\nOver the years though, the experiments are no longer being maintained and the\nplugins that use the non-Java runtimes take a lot of compatibility effort.\nIn addition, the Jenkins ruby runtime does not support Java 11.\nSpecifically, the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins\ncore developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and\nprocesses to keep the non-Java runtimes barely working.\nExamples of the experienced issues include compatibility with jep:200[Switch Remoting/XStream blocklist to a permitlist] where we had to allow many Ruby Runtime classes in the Jenkins core to support serialization of data.\n\nIn 2018 we discussed the future of the Ruby Runtime based plugins.\nThere was a consensus that we want to deprecate and remove the plugins so that Jenkins users do not experience issues .\nDaniel Beck created jep:7[Deprecation of ruby-runtime] for that.\nOver the years, the functionality provided by Ruby plugins has been largely replaced by other implementations,\nand hence we have decided to proceed with the deprecation\n( discussion).\n\nOne month from now, January 22nd, 2022, the default Jenkins update center will stop distributing\nthe Ruby runtime plugin, the plugins that use the Ruby runtime, the Python runtime plugin, and the plugin that uses the Python runtime.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nIf you are one of the few users who are using the following plugins, there will be no impact on your existing instances. The\nonly change will come for new installs. Suspended plugins will stay\ninstalled, but can not be newly installed without manually downloading\nreleases or using custom update centers.\n\nJenkins plugin management tools and distributions may be affected as well if they use the default update center to download the plugins and/or their metadata.\nIt includes but is not limited to the official Docker images,\nHelm charts,\nJenkinsfile Runner,\nCustom Jenkins WAR Packager,\nand the Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool.\nNote that all these tools allow custom update sites to be configured if required.\n\nThe lists below provide additional information about the plugins based on the Ruby Runtime and the Python Runtime.\nPlease plan your transition away from these plugins.\nThey will be removed from the official Jenkins update centers on January 22, 2022.\n\nAffected plugins\n\nGitlab Hook\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nContains multiple security vulnerabilties.\nSuggestion: Use the GitLab plugin and the GitLab Branch Source plugin.\n\nCucumber\n\nLast released 9 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run cucumber from the command line.\n\npyenv\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run pyenv from the command line.\n\nRvm\n\nLast released 5 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run rvm from the command line.\n\nCapitomcat\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Install Ruby and

years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the GitHub Commit Skip SCM Behaviour, Bitbucket Commit Skip SCM Behaviour, or SCM Skip to skip builds based on the content of commit messages.\nAlternately, use sh, bat, or other scripts to read git commit messages and conditionally execute Pipeline steps.\n\nInstallShield\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh, bat, or other scripts to run InstallShield.\n\nMySQL Job Databases\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use Jenkins Job Database Manager Plugin for MySQL.\n\nPathignore\n\nLast released 10 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the

Ruby Runtime based plugins and the Python Runtime based plugin.\nWe also thank those who participated in development of new plugins replacing the functionality.\nThese contributors helped millions of Jenkins users while the ecosystem was supported over the past 10 years\nand it is not taken for granted.\nNow we need to move on so that we can keep expanding the Jenkins architecture and developers tools.\nWe invite all contributors to participate in this effort and to help us to migrate the plugins to supported JVM-based platforms for plugins.\n\nMy instance is affected, what to do next?\n\nIf you do not use the affected plugins, the recommendation is to remove them.\nOtherwise, it is recommended to start migration out of the plugins to alternatives providing similar functionality.\n\nNot all plugins have alternatives.\nAt the moment the Jenkins core team does not plan to provide a replacement, but any contributions are welcome.\nIf you depend on the functionality,\nwe recommend reaching out to the community in the developer mailing list so that\nyou can coordinate the replacement with other affected users.","title":"Deprecating non-Java

critical security vulnerability has been identified in the popular \"Apache Log4j 2\" library.\nThis vulnerability is identified as CVE-2021-44228.\n\nLog4j in Jenkins\n\nThe Jenkins security team has confirmed that Log4j is not used in Jenkins core.\nJenkins plugins may be using Log4j.\nYou can identify whether Log4j is included with any plugin by running the following Groovy script in the Script Console :\n\norg.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup.class.protectionDomain.codeSource\n\nIf this results in the following error, Log4j is not included in any installed and enabled plugin:\n\ngroovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: org for class: Script1\n\nOtherwise, the script output will print one location where Log4j is found, which includes the plugin name in the path.\nThat plugin should be disabled or uninstalled, followed by a Jenkins restart and another script execution until the \"No such property\" error appears.\n\nAffected plugins and their mitigation status are listed in the Jenkins issue tracker.\nSee this Jira Epic for components known to be affected.\n\nLog4j in web application containers\n\nIf you are hosting your Jenkins in a separate web application container like Tomcat, Websphere, or Glassfish, check with the providers of those containers to assess if they are using a vulnerable version of Log4j.\n\nWhen Jenkins runs from the Docker image, a native installer package (deb, rpm, msi), or is invoked with java -jar jenkins.war, it is not running inside a separate web application container.\nIt is using the built-in Jetty web application container that is bundled inside Jenkins and does not include Log4j.\n\nLog4j in Jenkins project infrastructure\n\nThe Jenkins infrastructure team is currently checking all Jenkins project infrastructure for the presence of vulnerable versions of the Log4j library.\nThis work is ongoing.\nWe may decide to disable some services temporarily out of an abundance of caution.\nYou can see the status of services on the status page.","title":"Apache Log4j 2 vulnerability

continuous integration environment is a mixed bag of machines, platforms, build toolchains and operating systems.\nIdeally, you want as much flexibility as possible in managing these environments.\nYou want your build machines to be interchangeable and you don’t want to tie your builds to a particular machine.\nUsing containers as build agents is an effective way to get the flexibility you need to create applications faster and more effectively.\n\nMost modern software organizations recognize the benefits of deploying and managing applications as containers.\nAnd now more organizations are using containers to unify their build and test environments across machines, and to provide an efficient mechanism for deploying applications.\n\nIf you’re new to containers, think of it as the next step beyond virtualization.\nIt consists of a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.\nA container image contains everything it needs to run independently of the server on which it lives: It contains a copy of the operating system, along with your application.\nThat could include a database, code, configuration files, dependencies, and so forth.\n\nContainerization is a great way to simplify migration of Jenkins instances to different machines, as well as simplify ongoing maintenance and upgrades.\nStarting with versions 2.5 and higher, Jenkins Pipeline has built-in support for interacting with Docker from within a Jenkinsfile.\n\nAlthough you can install and upgrade Jenkins using OS-installable packages, the container images of Jenkins take installation and upgrades to a new level, removing a lot of the complications with maintaining the Jenkins installation.\nThat’s one of the main reasons you should prefer the container images of Jenkins over OS-specific installation packages.\n\nUsing containers as build agents for greater Pipeline flexibility\n\nWhat about using containers in your build agents? You’ll recall that Jenkins agents are the \"workers\" that perform operations requested by the Jenkins controller.\n\nWhat is a Jenkins agent?\n\nMany of you have been writing Jenkins pipelines for awhile, but you’ve been constrained by the tooling that’s available on your agent.\nBut what if you no longer had to be constrained by specific versions of specific tools on specific agents? And that you had full control over the tooling that you’re using just by having Docker available on your agents?\n\nWell, that is exactly what’s possible by using containers as build agents for Jenkins.\nTo learn how to set up your agents with Docker, watch this step-by-step video.\n\nHow to Setup Docker Containers As Build Agents for Jenkins\n\nSo why would you want to use a container as your build agent? As a pipeline author, it gives you the ability to define the tools and the specific versions of those tools that you want to use in your pipeline so that those items are not being mandated or managed by others.\n\nSecondly, if in your environment, someone else has to install the tools for you on your agent, you can completely bypass all of that because you’re able to dynamically bring in the tools that you want or need at runtime.\n\nFinally, it gives you the chance to experiment with different tools without having to make a long-term commitment to those tools.\nBecause if you have a dependency on someone else installing tools for you, that might take a long time.\nBut by running it as a container, you can test it out, and if it works, great! Then you have the option to work with somebody else to get static versions of those tools installed on your agents, or you can just stay with your container-based build agents.\n\nThanks to our Sponsor\n\nDarin works for CloudBees.\nCloudBees helps Fortune 1000 enterprises manage and scale Jenkins.\nThanks to CloudBees for sponsoring the creation of this blog post.","title":"Use Containers

year, the Duchess community embraced a new challenge:\nworking on women’s presence in Open Source while participating in Jenkins during the Hacktoberfest, a yearly event.\n\nHuge congrats to all the contributors! 🥳\n\nNote: This blog is a translation, the source blog post is located here https://www.duchess-france.org/duchess-hacktoberfest-2021/\n\nAnne-Laure Gaillard Interview\n\nHello Anne-Laure, can you introduce yourself?\n\nLinkedIn\n\nAfter a PhD in Computer Science and a few years in Software Development, I specialized in software quality assurance, and particularly in the testing domain.\nI’m a supporter of the doctrine: “Quality is everyone’s business”. Fond of agility, I’m part of the organization committee of the Agile Tour Bordeaux since 2020.\n\nI also like to engage in sporting challenges: I swam across the Garonne (a big river in the south of France) and finished 2 triathlons.\nKeeping the best for the end: I’m the mother of two kids who taught me it’s possible to speak about Pokemon with one, while drawing a unicorn with the other.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nDuring my studies, I met quite a lot of “nerds / geeks” contributing to Linux distributions (Gentoo & Debian).\nTheir technical skills seemed higher than mine and the Open Source universe looked inaccessible to me.\nConcerning Jenkins, I am a user (now contributor) of it, but not an administrator.\n\nWhat motivated you to participate in that hackathon?\n\nI dared to participate thanks to the Duchess (and mainly Angélique, thanks to her).\nHaving the support and backing of the community was my motivation.\n\nWhat will you remember from this experience?\n\nFrom a professional point of view, I perfected my knowledge of Git, and I had a chance to overview part of the quality processes from Open Source projects.\nMy first Pull Request was approved by… 9 people!\nThe fourth reviewer did find an issue.\nWho can tell me code review isn’t useful now?\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I remember two things.\nThe first one: Open Source communities are not elitist communities.\nEvery contribution matters, even small ones.\nThe people I met were positive and benevolent.\nThe second one could be illustrated by a quote from Grace Hopper: “If it’s a good idea, go ahead and do it. It’s much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.”.\n\nDo you have anything more to say?\n\nAfter Jenkins, I also submitted Pull Requests to others Open Source projects.\nThe problem: with such a diversity of Open Source projects, how to organize your time?\n\nAnne-Laure Gaillard contributions during hacktoberfest\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5779\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5785\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5804\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5806\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5807\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5808\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5822\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5823\n\nhttps://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/pull/25\n\nhttps://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/pull/23\n\nhttps://github.com/sarequl/Netflix-Helper/pull/6\n\nBertha Torres Interview\n\nTwitter: @tatoberres\n\nLinkedIn\n\nHello Bertha, can you introduce yourself?\n\nComing from a literature training and as a language teacher for more than 15 years, it’s while moving to a high mountain area that a need to explore other skills set in.\n\nThus, a self-taught training followed by a validated file for financing diploma training followed one another and confirmed to me that life is too short to waste it on what does not make sense to us.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nParticipating in Open Source appeared to me in that exploratory process like a learning opportunity…\nwhich I thought was inaccessible of course! I didn’t see myself writing code.\n\nBut thanks to the Duchess France community, I learned how to contribute at my level and to understand the contribution process.\nIt’ll allow me as things progress to contribute in more domains.\n\nCan you tell us how the woman version of Jenkins was born?\n\nWell… In the presentation video for Hacktoberfest, the artwork was mentioned ( https://www.jenkins.io/artwork/) and Angélique also mentioned it during the first meeting…\nAnd one must admit that looking at it, you can see a lot of different things but women.\n\nSo I imagined a governess, very confident, efficient, very clever, scrupulously combed, nicely dressed, who might represent the personality of what Jenkins is made of.\n\nDo you have anything to add?\n\nThis time I was able to participate through Pull Requests related to translation and drawing. I’ll probably do it again!\n\nBertha Torres contributions during hacktoberfest\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/4627\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5796\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5797\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/214\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/215\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ant-plugin/pull/78\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ant-plugin/pull/77\n\nPauline Iogna’s Interview\n\nTwitter: @pauline_io\n\nHello Pauline, can you introduce yourself?\n\nI’m a backend developer in Java/Scala, and an active member of Duchess France.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nI didn’t really have an opinion about Jenkins before doing the hackathon.\nLike many other people, I’m a Jenkins user but I didn’t know its source code.\n\nWhat motivated you to participate in this hackathon?\n\nActually participating in Hacktoberfest.\nJust bringing a contribution, even modest, on an open source project.\n\nWhat did you discover through that hackathon?\n\nTechnically, I discovered how to do MVC with Apache Jelly.\nI also rediscovered the contribution process of Open Source projects.\n\nThe Hacktoberfest mechanism is really well thought out for onboarding people wanting to start working on Open Source projects.\nWith Angélique’s help on top of that to animate sessions on the Duchess France Slack channel, we had the best conditions to contribute to that important project.\n\nWhat will you remember from this experience?\n\nIt’s not that simple to contribute to a project you’re just discovering, it requires a bit of investment and patience.\nOn Jenkins, the contributors are really reactive and the Pull Requests are quickly reviewed.\nThe feedback is useful and benevolent.\nThere is one Jira project listing all the features and bugs to be worked on for the project.\nSome tickets are flagged as “newbie” allowing those who are beginners to pick easily and quickly doable tickets.\n\nPauline Iogna contributions\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5835\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5793\n\nA few words about the organization within Duchess France\n\nThe framework was intentionally simple and flexible. We started with an online kick start meeting for describing a bit of context, and more precisely the Jenkins universe.\n\nOnline kick start meeting for context\n\nThen, we mainly exchanged through the Duchess Slack channel in an asynchronous way on a dedicated channel, as well as a 30 minutes meeting each Friday during October.","title":"Interview of Duchess contributors for hacktoberfest 2021 on Jenkins","tags":["jenkins","hacktoberfest","developer","newcomer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/19e71/ajard.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/77b35/ajard.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/d4a57/ajard.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/19e71/ajard.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/68974/ajard.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/ef6ff/ajard.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/8257c/ajard.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/6766a/ajard.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/22bfc/ajard.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"aHenryJard","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Angélique is a software developer since 2006, Jenkins user since ever and plugins developer since 2019.

bundles Guava, a core Java library from Google.\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.320 (released on November 10, 2021), Jenkins has upgraded the Guava library from\n11.0.1 (released on January 9, 2012) to\n31.0.1 (released on September 27, 2021).\nPlugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nUse the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\n\nMotivation\n\nMany security-conscious organizations using, or planning to use, Jenkins run off-the-shelf security scanners to look for known vulnerabilities.\nThese commonly flag the obsolete Guava library as susceptible to a serialization-related vulnerability ( CVE-2018-10237) and recommend upgrading.\nWhile Jenkins uses JEP-200 to form an explicit list of allowed classes for deserialization,\nand the two Guava classes affected by CVE-2018-10237 are not and will never be added to the list,\nit is time-consuming for the security team to respond to purported security reports\nand for users to justify exemptions from policy to use Jenkins anyway.\n\nFurthermore, the decade-old version of Guava has long been a maintenance burden for Jenkins developers.\nIn a world where Dependabot offers upgrades to libraries released just hours before,\nit is unpleasant to be working with dependencies that are many years old.\n\nFor more information, see JEP-233.\n\nUpgrading\n\nThe vast majority of plugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nJenkins users need only upgrade plugins to compatible versions as documented in the \"Released As\" field in Jira.\nIt is critical to use the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\nFailure to upgrade plugins to compatible versions may result in ClassNotFoundException, NoClassDefFoundError, or other low-level Java errors.\n\nReporting issues\n\nIf you find a regression in a plugin, please file a bug report in Jira:\n\nOpen JEP-233 issues\n\nWhen reporting an issue, include the following information:\n\nUse the JEP-233 label.\n\nProvide the complete list of installed plugins as suggested in the bug reporting guidelines.\n\nProvide the complete stack trace, if relevant.\n\nProvide steps to reproduce the issue from scratch on a minimal Jenkins installation; the scenario should fail when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.320 or later and pass when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.319 or earlier.\n\nIf you maintain a Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nthen please check if there is a pull request awaiting merge or release.\nIf you use an unmaintained Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nconsider stepping up and adopting the plugin to release a compatible version.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe expect to see a bit of disruption from these changes\nbut hope that in the long run they will save time for core and plugin developers\nand lead to a more secure and stable tool.\nPlease reach out on the developers' list with any questions or suggestions.","title":"Guava library upgrade (breaking

a woman.\nSpecial thanks to tatoberres for the new artwork!\n\nThea Mushambadze created the new Jenkins logo for Georgia logo.\n\nThanks very much!\n\nPlugin Docs Migration to GitHub\n\nThe Jenkins project started the migration of plugin documentation to GitHub almost two years ago.\nHacktoberfest 2021 identified 40 candidate plugins to migrate their documentation to GitHub.\nDan Heath,\nDeepak Gupta,\nAvinash Upadhyaya K R,\nRajan Kumar Singh, and\nDheeraj Singh Jodha provided a total of 29 pull requests migrating plugin documentation to GitHub.\n\nSpecial thanks to the contributors and to the plugin maintainers that merged and released documentation migration pull requests.\nEight plugins have fully migrated their documentation to GitHub through Hacktoberfest contributions.\nAn additional thirteen plugins have merged the documentation change and will complete the migration with their next plugin release.\n\nThe plugin documentation migration was coordinated through a worksheet.\nA tutorial video describing the documentation migration process is also available.\n\nImplementing Content Security Policy\n\nWadeck Follonier provided a tutorial to prepare Jenkins for a broader implementation of Content Security Policy.\nSix contributors provided pull requests to Jenkins core to create separate JavaScript files from JavaScript that was previously implemented inside the Jenkins 'jelly' files.\nMoving JavaScript into separate files prepares Jenkins to implement Content Security Policy protections against JavaScript embedded in HTML.\n\nJenkins Architecture Diagrams\n\nAngélique Jard provided architectural diagrams showing a dataflow view of Jenkins and a high level view of Jenkins.\nThose diagrams help others understand the internal structure of Jenkins and how it interacts with users and with other systems.\n\nModernizing Plugins Video Series\n\nDarin Pope created five videos illustrating some of the small steps that a new contributor can use to help modernize a plugin.\nAdditional plugin modernization and adoption ideas are included in the\"Contributing to Open Source\" workshop from DevOps World 2021.\n\nModernizing Jenkins Plugins\n\nThanks to All\n\nWe offer our most sincere thanks to all Hacktoberfest contributors and to the many pull request reviewers.","title":"Jenkins in Hacktoberfest

sample:\n\nunclassified:\n  globalDatabaseConfiguration:\n    database:\n      postgreSQL:\n        database: \"jenkins\"\n        hostname: \"${DB_HOST_NAME}\"\n        password: \"${DB_PASSWORD}\"\n        username: \"${DB_USERNAME}\"\n        validationQuery: \"SELECT 1\"\n  junitTestResultStorage:\n    storage: \"database\"\n\nUsing the plugin\n\nNow run some builds, here’s an example pipeline configuration to get you started if you’re just trying out the plugin:\n\nnode {\n  writeFile file: 'x.xml', text: '''\n\n'''\n  junit 'x.xml'\n}\n\nYou will see a test result trend appear like below on the builds project page:\n\nIf you check on the controller’s file system you will see no junitResult.xml for new builds.\n\nIf you connect to your database and run:\n\nSELECT * FROM caseresults;\n\nYou will see a number of test results in the database.\n\nWhat happens to existing test results?\n\nExisting test results will stay on disk but will not be loaded.\n\nCurrently there is no migration scripts or plugin functionality to do this, if you need it then please raise an issue.\n\nHow are test results cleaned up\n\nWhen a job or build is deleted the related test results are removed.\n\nThis is expected to be done as part of a 'Build Discarder'.\n\nIf you wish to keep your results longer than this you can disable this feature by enabling:\n\nSkip cleanup of test result on build deletion on the system configuration page.\n\nIf you need more complex cleanup strategies built into the plugin then please raise an issue.\n\nAPI\n\nThe API is defined at:\n\njenkinsdoc:junit:io.jenkins.plugins.junit.storage.JunitTestResultStorage[]\n\njenkinsdoc:junit:io.jenkins.plugins.junit.storage.JunitTestResultStorageDescriptor[]\n\njenkinsdoc:junit:io.jenkins.plugins.junit.storage.TestResultImpl[]\n\nJunitTestResultStorage#load is passed a job name and build which can be used to construct an instance of the external storage implementation.\n\nThis implementation will then act on that job and build except for the optimised calls that act across all builds.\n\nThe API contains the basic methods like getFailCount, getSkipCount, but also APIs that are optimised for retrieving data for the trend graphs on the job page and the test result history page.\n\nThese allow single API calls to be made for what used to be a lot of work for Jenkins to look up before.\n\nFeedback\n\nI would love to hear your feedback & suggestions for this feature.\n\nPlease create an issue at https://github.com/jenkinsci/junit-plugin or provide feedback on https://community.jenkins.io","title":"Introducing external storage for
