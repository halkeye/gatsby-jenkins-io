A bad pipeline cannot take down another one & the kubernetes scheduler manages them all\n\neach step can be any command in any container image with whatever secrets, volume mounts, environment variables and resource limits you need\n\nthere is no need to bundle a JVM or Jenkins Remoting container into the pod so you can keep resources and cost down\n\nWhy use Jenkins and Tekton together?\n\nJenkins is the most popular open source automation server around. Lots of developers use it every day to get things done.\nJenkins can now be used to automate Tekton pipelines too which helps teams digitally transform to more cloud native solutions for their CI and CD.\nIn such a case, you can use Tekton pipeline engine while getting all benefits from Jenkins as an orchestrator, user interface and the reporting engine.\n\nIntroducing the Tekton Plugin for Jenkins\n\nThe Tekton Client plugin for Jenkins lets you easily use Jenkins to automate creating and running Tekton pipelines.\nIt bridges the Kubernetes learning gap and allows invoking Tekton Pipelines and resources through Jenkins.\nThis allows users to not have much of the Kubernetes specific knowledge beforehand and work.\n\nIts a single Jenkins plugin to install - so it’s easy to use.\n\nFor background check out the  blog post Bridging the Gap with Tekton-client-plugin for Jenkins by the founder of the plugin Vibhav Bobade.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe Tekton Client plugin for jenkins assumes you have access to a kubernetes cluster.\n\nThe kubernetes cluster should have Tekton pipelines installed.\n\nIf you have not yet installed Tekton you could use this tekton helm chart\n\nThe Jenkins controller should also have kubernetes RBAC access to be able to create Tekton resources and watch them and their associated pods and pod logs.\n\nIf you are running your Jenkins controller inside Kubernetes then an easy way to setup the RBAC is to install the Jenkins Resource Helm Chart in the same namespace as your Jenkins controller.\n\nAnother option is to use an installation of Jenkins X and let it setup a Jenkins controller via GitOps\n\nSpecifying the Tekton pipelines\n\nYou can configure the Tekton pipeline via:\n\na file path in a git clone block\n\na URL to a tekton YAML file\n\na block of YAML\n\nWe recommend defining Tekton pipelines as YAML files and checking them into a git repository so that you can use GitOps and follow the Pipeline As Code pattern.\n\nThis means that you can version your pipelines in git. It also means you can benefit from the various IDE plugins available for Tekton such as VS Code and IDEA so that you get auto completion, formatting and validation while editing the YAML.\n\nSo you can use the usual Git provider support in Jenkins to clone the git repository that contains then Tekton YAML file then reference the file by name.\n\nReusing Pipelines from the Tekton Catalog\n\nThe Tekton Catalog defines a ton of Tekton Tasks you can reuse in your pipelines\n\nWe have found when it comes to a microsevices style architecture you end up with lots of repositories and pipelines. Then using a Pipeline As Code pattern with GitOps we want to Version Everything but also make it easy for any repository to use any version of any task or pipeline.\n\ne.g. you may have many repositories using the current version of a pipeline but want to try out a new change to the pipeline in just 1 repository to verify it works well; then if it does, incrementally roll that change out to more repositories.\n\nThis can make it hard trying to reuse as much as you can across the different git repositories while also minimising the number of versions and forks of git repositories you have and simplifying the maintenance of all of the pipelines.\n\nWe have found on the Jenkins X project that a nice way to do this via GitOps such that we reference versioned Tekton Tasks and Pipelines in git so that they are easy to reuse or override.\n\nSo we reuse Tasks and Pipelines via the uses: image notation which lets us keep all of our Tekton Tasks and Pipelines in vanilla Tekton YAML; so that the IDE completion and validation works - but we can easily reuse Tasks or steps from libraries while also Versioning Everything\n\nNote that if wish to reuse steps/tasks via the uses: image notation then you must click the Tekton Catalog flag in your Job definition which will then resolve the uses: clause with the actual step/task.\n\nWhat is Jenkins X?\n\nThe Jenkins X project automates your CI/CD on kubernetes to help you accelerate :\n\nAutomated CI/CD pipelines lets you focus on your actually application code while Jenkins X automatically creates battle tested Tekton CI/CD pipelines for your project which are managed via GitOps so that its super easy to keep your pipelines up to date across your repositories or to upgrade or override pipelines or steps for specific repositories.\n\nAutomatic promotion of versioned artifacts via GitOps through your Environments such as Staging, Pre-production and Production whether they are running in the same kubernetes cluster or you are using multiple clusters for your environments\n\nPreview Environments lets you propose code changes via Pull Requests and have a Preview Environment automatically created, running your code in kubernetes to get fast feedback from your team before agreeing to merge changes to the main branch\n\nChatOps comment on Pull Requests to give feedback, approve/hold changes, trigger optional pipelines for additional testing and other ChatOps commands\n\nAll of the above is implemented in reusable Tekton pipelines.\n\nReusing Jenkins X Pipelines\n\nSo how can we reuse automated CI/CD pipelines from Jenkins X project from Jenkins?\n\nMake sure you have the Tekton Client plugin for Jenkins installed in your Jenkins server.\n\nUsing a working template\n\nIf you want to start with a working example then\n\nCreate A Git Repository From This Template\n\nadd a new Frestyle project to your Jenkins server\n\nenable the Git source code management for your new github.com repository\n\nclick Add build Step (near the bottom of the page) and then select Tekton : Create Resource (Raw)\n\nmake sure that FILE is selected for the input and enter the name.lighthouse/jenkins-x/release.yaml for the file name\n\nif you are using a Jenkins X cluster enter jx for the namespace\n\nensure that Enable Tekton Catalog is checked\n\nnow save the pipeline - it should look something like this:\n\nNow if you trigger the pipeline you should see it create a Tekton Pipeline and you should see the output of the tekton pipeline in the Jenkins console. The pipeline is actually running as a completely separate Pod in kubernetes; the Jenkins controller just tails the log into the console.\n\nIn a Jenkins X cluster this pipeline should just work (reusing all the cloud resources and IAM roles setup by the Terraform) but in an arbitrary kubernetes cluster you may get issues around not being able to push images or promote due to lack of GitOps environments being defined which we can help you work through via the Jenkins X slack room\n\nUsing an existing repository\n\nYou can configure a Pull Request or Release pipeline in your project by copying the YAML file for the language pack you wish to use.\n\ne.g. if you are using maven then copy pullrequest.yaml or release.yaml into your projects source code then reference it from your Jenkins Job:\n\nThen follow the above instructions for setting up a Freestyle project for your git repository and referencing the file name for your pipeline.\n\nOverriding steps\n\nBeing able to reuse steps from libraries of pipelines is awesome; but sometimes you need to change things. The assumptions, commands, arguments, environment variables or approaches used for every step in a library may not quite match what you need on a specific application. You may need to run steps before/after steps in the library or you may need to override a specific step to do something different.\n\nYou can easily customize any inherited step in any shared pipeline or add custom steps before/after any step.\n\nThe fact that all the Tekton YAML is fully declarative makes it super easy to modify things via your IDE with validation and smart completion and not have to use a scripting language and understand complex shared pipeline libraries.\n\nThe easiest way to try overriding a step is to install the jx binary to your $PATH then use the jx pipeline override command which will create a new locally overridden step you can then just edit in your IDE.\n\nThen at any time you can view the effective pipeline when you make local changes\n\nComparing the Kubernetes and Tekton plugins\n\nThose of you using Jenkins on a Kubernetes cluster are probably using the kubernetes plugin right now.\n\nHere is an example of how to use a Jenkinsfile with a pod YAML file so that you can run commands in different containers in the pod.\n\nWhat this means is that:\n\na kubernetes pod is created based on the pod YAML file which is scheduled by kubernetes\n\nthe Jenkinsfile runs on the Jenkins controller talking over Jenkins remoting to the pod to tell it to run commands in different containers. The pod includes the jnlp container which does the remoting between the Jenkins controller and the pod\n\nThis has a few issues:\n\neach container in the pod must have a shell so that jnlp can invoke commands. This may mean you have to create your own images\n\nit can be a little slow to start since there is chattiness with the Jenkins controller and the pod - whereas with Tekton pods just start and run locally without any coodination with the Jenkins controller\n\nyou have to maintain 2 files: the Jenkinsfile and the pod.yaml and it’s hard to share/override both of those files across multiple repositories as you need to make changes (e.g. overriding environment variables/images/commands/resource limits on demand on steps).\n\nThough one downside of the tekton approach is that by default there is no automatic synchronisation of state; after a Task in tekton completes there’s no automatic upload of state to the Jenkins controllers disk. You can always add a step in your Task to upload workspace state to the Jenkins controller if that’s what you want.\n\nThough remember that tekton plugin doesn’t take anything away; so you can mix and match the kubernetes and tekton plugins to suit your needs.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe are really excited about the combination of Jenkins, Tekton and Jenkins X letting developers pick the best tool for the job while becoming more cloud native and increasing the automation help reduce the amount of manual work creating and maintaining pipelines while also helping to improve the quality and practices of our CI/CD.\n\nPlease try it out and let us know how you get on!","title":"Easily reuse Tekton and Jenkins X from Jenkins","tags":["jenkins-x","kubernetes","pipeline","tekton","gitops","interoperability"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/19e71/jstrachan.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/77b35/jstrachan.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/d4a57/jstrachan.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/19e71/jstrachan.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/68974/jstrachan.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/ef6ff/jstrachan.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/8257c/jstrachan.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/6766a/jstrachan.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/22bfc/jstrachan.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"jstrachan","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>James is a long time open source contributor, created the Groovy programming language and Apache Camel integration framework.\nFor the past few years he&#8217;s been working on CI/CD with Kubernetes.</p>\n</div>","id":"jstrachan","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"James Strachan","slug":"/blog/authors/jstrachan","twitter":"jstrachan"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","id":"31f8965a-bc62-54ab-a155-4d858e063b0e","slug":"/blog/2018/04/13/jenkins-x-23-days-later/","strippedHtml":"Its been 24 days since we\nannounced Jenkins X,\na CI/CD solution for modern cloud applications on Kubernetes.\nI’m truly blown away by the response and feedback from the community - thank you!\n\nWe’ve also had lots of folks report they’ve successfully used Jenkins X\non a number of clouds including GKE, AWS and AKS along with on-premises clusters which is great to hear!\n\nHere’s a brief overview of the changes in the last 24 days from the\nRoadmap :\n\nwe now fully support GitHub and GitHub enterprise.

It’s all automated for you out of the box! So you can focus instead on delivering value!\n\nAt the same time, Jenkins X doesn’t hide anything. If you do want to hack the Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile or Helm charts for your apps or their environments then go right ahead - those are all available versioned in git with the rest of your source code with full CI/CD on it all. GitOps FTW!\n\nJenkins X automates CI/CD and DevOps best practices for you - so you can become a faster performing team! Let your butler do more work for you!\n\nDemo\n\nHere’s a demonstration of Jenkins X running on GKE:\n\nYou can check out more demos here.\n\nJenkins X Features\n\nNow lets walk through the features of Jenkins X that we showed in the demo:\n\nAutomated CI/CD Pipelines\n\nCreate new Spring Boot projects, new quickstarts or import existing source code quickly into Jenkins X via the jx command line tool and:\n\nget a Pipeline automatically setup for you that implements best practice CI/CD features:\n\ncreates a Jenkinsfile for defining the CI/CD pipelines through declarative pipeline-as-code\n\ncreates a Dockerfile for packaging the application up as an immutable container image (for applications which generate images)\n\ncreates a Helm chart for deploying and running your application on Kubernetes\n\nensures your code is in a git repository (e.g. GitHub) with the necessary webhooks to trigger the Jenkins CI/CD pipelines on push events\n\ntriggers the first release pipeline to promote your application to your teams Staging Environment\n\nThen on each Pull Request:\n\na CI pipeline is triggered to build your application and run all the tests ensuring you keep the master branch in a ready to release state\n\nyour Pull Request is deployed to a Preview Environment (more on this later)\n\nWhen a Pull Request is merged to the master branch the Release pipeline is triggered to create a new release:\n\na new semantic version number is generated\n\nthe source code is modified for the new version (e.g. pom.xml files get their elements modified) and then tagged in git\n\nnew versioned artifacts are published including:\n\ndocker image, helm chart and any language specific artifacts (e.g. pom.xml and jar files for Java, npm packages for node or binaries for go etc)\n\nthe new version is promoted to Environments (more on this later)\n\nEnvironment Promotion via GitOps\n\nIn Jenkins X each team gets their own environments. The default environments are Staging and Production but teams can create as many environments as they wish and call them whatever they prefer.\n\nAn Environment is a place to deploy code and each Environment maps to a separate namespace in Kubernetes so they are isolated from each other and can be managed independently.\n\nWe use something called GitOps to manage environments and perform promotion. This means that:\n\nEach environment gets its own git repository to store all the environment specific configuration together with a list of all the applications and their version and configuration.\n\nPromotion of new versions of applications to an environment results in:\n\na Pull Request is created for the configuration change that triggers the CI pipeline tests on the Environment along with code review and approval\n\nonce the Pull Request is merged the release pipeline for the environment which updates the applications running in that environment by applying the helm chart metadata from the git repository.\n\nEnvironments can be configured to either promote automatically as part of a release pipeline or they can use manual promotion.\n\nThe defaults today are for the Staging environment to use automatic promotion; so all merges to master are automatically promoted to Staging. Then the Production environment is configured to use manual promotion; so you choose when do promote.\n\nHowever it is easy to change the  configuration of how many environments you need and how they are configured via the jx create environment and jx edit environment commands\n\nPreview Environments\n\nJenkins X lets you create Preview Environments for Pull Requests. Typically this happens automatically in the Pull Request Pipelines when a Pull Request is submitted but you can also perform this manually yourself via the jx preview command.\n\nThe following happens when a Preview Environment is created:\n\na new Environment of kind Preview is created along with a kubernetes namespace which show up the jx get environments command along with the jx environment and jx namespace commands so you can see which preview environments are active and switch into them to look around\n\nthe Pull Request is built as a preview docker image and chart and deployed into the preview environment\n\na comment is added to the Pull Request to let your team know the preview application is ready for testing with a link to open the application. So in one click your team members can try out the preview!\n\nThis is particularly useful if you are working on a web application or REST endpoint; it lets your team interact with the running Pull Request to help folks approve changes.\n\nFeedback\n\nIf the commit comments reference issues (e.g. via the text fixes #123) then Jenkins X pipelines will generate release notes like those of the jx releases.\n\nAlso, as the version associated with those new commits is promoted to Staging or Production, you will get automated comments on each fixed issue that the issue is now available for review in the corresponding environment along with a link to the release notes and a link to the app running in that environment. e.g.\n\nGetting started\n\nHopefully you now want to give Jenkins X a try. One of the great features of Jenkins is that it’s super easy to get started: install Java, download a war and run via java -jar jenkins.war.\n\nWith Jenkins X we’ve tried to follow a similarly simple experience. One complication is that Jenkins X has more moving pieces than a single JVM; it also needs a Kubernetes cluster :)\n\nFirst you need to download and install the jx command line tool so its on your PATH.\n\nThen you need to run a single command to create a new Kubernetes cluster and install Jenkins X (in this example, on GKE).\n\njx create cluster gke\n\nToday we support creating Kubernetes clusters and installing Jenkins X on Amazon (AWS), Google (GKE), Microsoft Azure, and even locally using minikube.\nWe plan to support AWS EKS soon.\n\nAt the time of this writing the easiest cloud to get started with is Google’s GKE so we recommend you start there unless you already use AWS or Azure. Amazon and Microsoft are working hard to make Kubernetes clusters as easy to create and manage as they are on GKE.\n\nAll the public clouds have a free tier so you should be able to spin up a Kubernetes cluster and install Jenkins X for a few hours then tear it down and it should be cheaper than a cup of coffee (probably free!). Just remember to tear down the cluster when you are done!\n\nHere’s a demo of creating a kuberentes cluster and installing Jenkins X :\n\nIf you really don’t want to use the public cloud, you can install Jenkins X on an existing kubernetes cluster (if it has RBAC enabled!). Or, if you can install and run minikube, then you should be able to install Jenkins X on it as well.\n\nRelationship between Jenkins and Jenkins X\n\nJenkins is the core CI/CD engine within Jenkins X. So Jenkins X is built on the massive shoulders of Jenkins and its awesome community.\n\nWe are proposing Jenkins X as a sub project within the Jenkins foundation as Jenkins X has a different focus: automating CI/CD for the cloud using Jenkins plus other open source tools like Kubernetes, Helm, Git, Nexus/Artifactory etc.\n\nOver time we are hoping Jenkins X can help drive some changes in Jenkins itself to become more cloud native, which will benefit the wider Jenkins community in addition to Jenkins X.\n\nPlease join us!\n\nSo I hope the above has given you a feel for the vision of where we are heading with Jenkins X and to show where we are today. The project is still very young, we have lots to do and we are looking for more input on where to go next and what to focus on. We’re also working on high level roadmap.\n\nTo make Jenkins X a success we’d love you to get involved, try it out and give us feedback in the community! We love contributions whether its email, chat, issues or even better Pull Requests ;).\n\nIf you’re thinking of contributing here’s some ideas:\n\nGive us feedback. What could we improve? Anything you don’t like or you think is missing?\n\nHelp improve the documentation so its more clear how to get started and use Jenkins X\n\nAdd your own quickstarts so the Jenkins X community can easily bootstrap new projects using your quickstart. If you work on an open source project is there a good quickstart we could add to Jenkins X?\n\nIf you’d like to contribute to the code then try browse the current issues.\n\nwe have marked issues help wanted or good first issue to save you hunting around too much\n\nin particular we would love help on getting Jenkins X working well on windows or the integrations with cloud services, git providers and issues trackers\n\nfor more long term goals we’ve the roadmap\n\nwe could always use more test cases and to improve test coverage!\n\nTo help get faster feedback we are using Jenkins X as the CI/CD platform to develop Jenkins X itself. For example Jenkins X creates all the releases and release notes. We’ll talk more about UpdateBot in a future blog post but you can see all the automated pull requests generated in the various Jenkins X pipelines via UpdateBot pushing version changes from upstream dependencies into downstream repositories.\n\nNote that the Jenkins community tends to use IRC for chat and the Kubernetes community uses Slack, so Jenkins X has rooms for both IRC and slack depending on which chat technology you prefer - as the Jenkins X community will be working closely with both the Jenkins community and the various Kubernetes communities (Kubernetes, Helm, Skaffold, Istio et al).\n\nOne of the most rewarding things about open source is being able to learn from others in the community. So I’m hoping that even if you are not yet ready to use Kubernetes in your day job or are not yet interested in automating your Continuous Delivery - that you’ll at least consider taking a look at Jenkins X, if for no other reason than to help you learn more about all these new ideas, technologies and approaches!\n\nThanks for listening and I’m looking forward to seeing you in the community.\n\nLinks\n\nJenkins X JEP proposal\n\nJenkins X website\n\nGetting Started Guide\n\nDemos","title":"Introducing Jenkins X: a CI/CD solution for modern cloud applications on Kubernetes","tags":["jenkins-x","kubernetes","pipeline"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/19e71/jstrachan.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/77b35/jstrachan.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/d4a57/jstrachan.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/19e71/jstrachan.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/68974/jstrachan.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/ef6ff/jstrachan.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/8257c/jstrachan.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/6766a/jstrachan.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/22bfc/jstrachan.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"jstrachan","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>James is a long time open source contributor, created the Groovy programming language and Apache Camel integration framework.\nFor the past few years he&#8217;s been working on CI/CD with Kubernetes.</p>\n</div>","id":"jstrachan","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"James Strachan","slug":"/blog/authors/jstrachan","twitter":"jstrachan"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"jstrachan","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
