API tokens\n\nJenkins API tokens are an authentication mechanism that allows a tool (script, application, etc.) to impersonate a user\nwithout providing the actual password for use with the Jenkins API or CLI.\nThis is especially useful when your security realm is based on a central directory, like Active Directory or LDAP,\nand you don’t want to store your password in scripts.\nRecent versions of Jenkins also make it easier to use the remote API when using API tokens to authenticate,\nas no CSRF tokens need to be provided even with CSRF protection enabled.\nAPI tokens are not meant to — and cannot — replace the regular password for the Jenkins UI.\n\nPrevious problems\n\nWe addressed two major problems with the existing API token system in Jenkins 2.129:\n\nFirst, reported in JENKINS-32442,\nuser accounts in Jenkins have an automatically generated API token by default.\nAs these tokens can be used to authenticate as a given user, they increase the attack surface of Jenkins.\n\nThe second problem was reported in JENKINS-32776 :\nThe tokens were previously stored on disk in an encrypted form.\nThis meant that they could be decrypted by unauthorized users by leveraging another security vulnerability,\nor obtained, for example, from improperly secured backups, and used to impersonate other users.\n\nNew approach\n\nThe main objective of this new system is to provide API tokens that are stored in a unidirectional way on the disk,\ni.e. using a hashing algorithm (in this particular case SHA-256).\n\nWhile this means that you will not be able to see the actual API tokens anymore after you’ve created them,\nseveral features were added to mitigate this potential problem:\n\nYou can have multiple active API tokens at the same time.\nIf you don’t remember an API token’s value anymore, just revoke it.\n\nYou can name your tokens to know where they are used (and rename them after creation if desired).\nWe recommend that tokens use a name that indicates where (for example the application, script, or host) where it will be used.\n\nYou can track the usage of your tokens.\nEvery token keeps a record of the number of uses and the date of the last use.\nThis will allow you to better know which tokens are really used and which are no longer actively required.\nJenkins also encourages users to rotate old API tokens by highlighting their creation date in orange after six months, and in red after twelve months.\nThe goal is to remind the user that tokens are more secure when you regenerate them often:\nThe longer a token is around, perhaps passed around in script files and stored on shared drives,\nthe greater the chance it’s going to be accessed by someone not authorized to use it.\n\nFigure 1. Token usage tracking\n\nYou can revoke API tokens.\nWhen you know that you are not using a given token anymore, you can revoke it to reduce the risk of it getting used by unauthorized users.\nSince you can have multiple API tokens, this allows fine-grained control over which scripts, hosts, or applications are allowed to use Jenkins as a given user.\n\nMigrating to new API tokens\n\nTo help administrators migrate their instances progressively, the legacy behavior is still available, while new system is also usable.\n\nOn the user configuration page, the legacy token is highlighted with a warning sign,\nexplaining that users should revoke it and generate a new one (if needed) to increase security.\n\nFigure 2. Legacy token renewal still possible\n\nNew options for administrators\n\nIn order to let administrators control the pace of migration to the new API token system,\nwe added two global configuration options in the \"Configure Global Security\" page in the brand new \"API Token\" section:\n\nAn option to disable the creation of legacy API tokens on user creation.\n\nAn option to disable the recreation of legacy API tokens by users, forcing them to only use the new, unrecoverable API tokens.\n\nBoth options are disabled by default for new installations (the safe default), while they’re enabled when Jenkins is upgraded from before 2.129.\n\nFigure 3. Security Configuration options\n\nFigure 4. Remove legacy token and disable the re-creation\n\nNew administrator warnings\n\nWhen upgrading to Jenkins 2.129, an administrative monitor informs admins about the new options described above, and recommend disabling them.\n\nAnother administrative warnings shows up if at least one user still has a legacy API token.\nIt provides central control over legacy tokens still configured in the Jenkins instance, and allows revoking them all.\n\nFigure 5. Legacy token monitoring page\n\nSummary\n\nJenkins API tokens are now much more flexible: They allow and even encourage better security practices.\nWe recommend you revoke legacy API tokens as soon as you can, and only use the newly introduced API tokens.","title":"Security Hardening: New API token system in Jenkins 2.129+","tags":["community","core","security","upgrade"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/c09ea/wadeck.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/534e5/wadeck.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/99887/wadeck.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/c09ea/wadeck.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/5f0ee/wadeck.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/59a6b/wadeck.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/cbb78/wadeck.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/96250/wadeck.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/890ef/wadeck.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":171}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/wadeck.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"wadeck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Wadeck is a member of the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>, working on fixes and improvements to Jenkins security.\nHe likes to provide solutions that are both useful and easy to use.</p>\n</div>","id":"wadeck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Wadeck Follonier","slug":"/blog/authors/wadeck/","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"wadeck","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
