Why?\n\nJenkins version was way out of date and it was getting difficult to\nupgrade\n\nWolox has grown significantly over the past years\nand we’ve been experiencing scaling issues\n\nVery few people knew how to fix any issues with the server\n\nConfiguring jobs was not an easy task and that made our project\nkickoff process slower\n\nMaking changes to the commands that each job runs was not easy and not\nmany people had permissions to do so. Wolox has a wide range of\nprojects, with a wide variety of languages which made this problem even\nbigger.\n\nTaking into account these problems, we started digging into the newest\nversion of Jenkins to see how we could improve our CI. We needed to\nbuild a new CI that could, at least, address the following:\n\nProjects must be built using Docker. Our projects depend on one or\nmultiple docker images to run (app, database, redis, etc)\n\nEasy to configure and replicate if necessary\n\nEasy to add a new project\n\nEasy to change the building steps. Everyone working on the project\nshould be able to change if they want to run npm install or yarn\ninstall.\n\nInstalling Jenkins and Docker\n\nInstalling Jenkins is straightforward. You can visit\nJenkins Installation page and choose the\noption that best suits your needs.\n\nHere are the steps we followed to install Jenkins in AWS:\n\nsudo rpm — import https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key\nsudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo\nsudo yum install java-1.8.0 -y\nsudo yum remove java-1.7.0-openjdk -y\nsudo yum install jenkins -y\nsudo yum update -y\nsudo yum install -y docker\n\nAutomatically adding projects from Github\n\nAdding projects automatically from Github can be achieved using the\nGitHub Branch Source Plugin.\nIt allows Jenkins to scan a GitHub organization\nfor projects that match certain rules and add them to Jenkins\nautomatically. The only constraint that all branches must meet in order\nto be added is that they contain a Jenkinsfile that explains how to\nbuild the project.\n\nEasy to change configuration\n\nNot so easy to change configuration\n\nOne of the biggest pains we had with our previous Jenkins was the\ndifficulty of changing the steps necessary to build the project. If you\nlooked at a project’s build steps, you would find something like this:\n\n#!/bin/bash +x\nset -e\n\n# Remove unnecessary files\necho -e \"\\033[34mRemoving unnecessary files...\\033[0m\"\nrm -f log/*.log &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null\nrm -rf public/uploads/* &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null\n\n# Build Project\necho -e \"\\033[34mBuilding Project...\\033[0m\"\ndocker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} build\n\n# Prepare test database\nCOMMAND=\"bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:migrate\"\necho -e \"\\033[34mRunning: $COMMAND\\033[0m\"\ndocker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} run  \\\n\t-e RAILS_ENV=test web $COMMAND\n\n# Run tests\nCOMMAND=\"bundle exec rspec spec\"\necho -e \"\\033[34mRunning: $COMMAND\\033[0m\"\nunbuffer docker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} run web $COMMAND\n\n# Run rubocop lint\nCOMMAND=\"bundle exec rubocop app spec -R --format simple\"\necho -e \"\\033[34mRunning: $COMMAND\\033[0m\"\nunbuffer docker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} run -e RUBYOPT=\"-Ku\" web $COMMAND\n\nAnd some post build steps that cleaned up the docker:\n\n#!/bin/bash +x\ndocker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} stop &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null\ndocker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} rm --force &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null\ndocker stop `docker ps -a -q -f status=exited` &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null\ndocker rm -v `docker ps -a -q -f status=exited` &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null\ndocker rmi `docker images --filter 'dangling=true' -q --no-trunc` &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null\n\nAlthough these commands are not complex, changing any of them required\nsomeone with permissions to modify the job and an understanding ofwhat\nneeded to be done.\n\nJenkinsfile to the rescue…​ or not\n\nWith the current Jenkins version, we can take advantage of\nJenkins Pipeline and model our build\nflow in a file. This file is checked into the repository and, therefore,\nanyone with access to it can change the build steps. Yay!\n\nJenkins Pipeline even has support for:\n\nDocker and\nmultiple\nimages can be used for a build!\n\nSetting environment variables with withEnv and many other built -in\nfunctions that can be found\nhere.\n\nThis makes a perfect case for Wolox. We can have\nour build configuration in a file that’s checked into the repository and\ncan be changed by anyone with write access to it. However, a Jenkinsfile\nfor a simple rails project would look something like this:\n\n# sample Jenkinsfile. Might not compile\nnode {\n    checkout scm\n    withEnv(['MYTOOL_HOME=/usr/local/mytool']) {\n        docker.image(\"postgres:9.2\").withRun() { db ->\n            withEnv(['DB_USERNAME=postgres', 'DB_PASSWORD=', \"DB_HOST=db\", \"DB_PORT=5432\"]) {\n                docker.image(\"redis:X\").withRun() { redis ->\n                    withEnv([\"REDIS_URL=redis://redis\"]) {\n                        docker.build(imageName, \"--file .woloxci/Dockerfile .\").inside(\"--link ${db.id}:postgres --link ${redis.id}:redis\") {\n                            sh \"rake db:create\"\n                            sh \"rake db:migrate\"\n                            sh \"bundle exec rspec spec\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis file is not only difficult to read, but also difficult to change.\nIt’s quite easy to break things if you’re not familiar with Groovy and\neven easier if you know nothing about how Jenkins’ pipeline works.\nChanging or adding a new Docker image isn’t straightforward and might\nlead to confusion.\n\nConfiguring Jenkins Pipeline via YAML\n\nPersonally, I’ve always envied simple configuration files for CIs and\nthis time it was our chance to build CI that could be configured using a\nYAML file. After some analysis we concluded that a YAML like this one\nwould suffice:\n\nconfig:\n  dockerfile: .woloxci/Dockerfile\n  project_name: some-project-name\n\nservices:\n  - postgresql\n  - redis\n\nsteps:\n  analysis:\n    - bundle exec rubocop -R app spec --format simple\n    - bundle exec rubycritic --path ./analysis --minimum-score 80 --no-browser\n  setup_db:\n    - bundle exec rails db:create\n    - bundle exec rails db:schema:load\n  test:\n    - bundle exec rspec\n  security:\n    - bundle exec brakeman --exit-on-error\n  audit:\n    - bundle audit check --update\n\n\nenvironment:\n  RAILS_ENV: test\n  GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: a\n  GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: b\n  LANG: C.UTF-8\n\nIt outlines some basic configuration for the project, environment\nvariables that need to be present during the run, dependentservices, and\nour build steps.\n\nJenkinsfile + Shared Libraries = WoloxCI\n\nAfter investigating for a while about Jenkins and the pipeline, we found\nthat we could extend it with\nshared libraries.\nShared libraries are written in groovy and can be imported\ninto the pipeline and executed when necessary.\n\nIf you look carefully at this Jenkinsfile,\nwe see that the code is a chain of methods calls that receive a\nclosure, where we execute another method passing a new closure to it.\n\n# sample Jenkinsfile. Might not compile\nnode {\n    checkout scm\n    withEnv(['MYTOOL_HOME=/usr/local/mytool']) {\n        docker.image(\"postgres:9.2\").withRun() { db ->\n            withEnv(['DB_USERNAME=postgres', 'DB_PASSWORD=', \"DB_HOST=db\", \"DB_PORT=5432\"]) {\n                docker.image(\"redis:X\").withRun() { redis ->\n                    withEnv([\"REDIS_URL=redis://redis\"]) {\n                        docker.build(imageName, \"--file .woloxci/Dockerfile .\").inside(\"--link ${db.id}:postgres --link ${redis.id}:redis\") {\n                            sh \"rake db:create\"\n                            sh \"rake db:migrate\"\n                            sh \"bundle exec rspec spec\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nGroovy is flexible enough to allow this same declarative code to be\ncreated at runtime, making our dream of using a YAML to configure our\njob come true!\n\nIntroducing Wolox-CI\n\nThat’s how wolox-ci was born- our\nshared library for Jenkins!\n\nWith wolox-ci, our Jenkinsfile is now\nreduced to:\n\n@Library('wolox-ci') _\n\nnode {\n\n  checkout scm\n\n  woloxCi('.woloxci/config.yml');\n}\n\nNow it simply checks out the code and then calls wolox-ci. The library\nreads yaml file like this one\n\nconfig:\n  dockerfile: .woloxci/Dockerfile\n  project_name: some-project-name\n\nservices:\n  - postgresql\n  - redis\n\nsteps:\n  analysis:\n    - bundle exec rubocop -R app spec --format simple\n    - bundle exec rubycritic --path ./analysis --minimum-score 80 --no-browser\n  setup_db:\n    - bundle exec rails db:create\n    - bundle exec rails db:schema:load\n  test:\n    - bundle exec rspec\n  security:\n    - bundle exec brakeman --exit-on-error\n  audit:\n    - bundle audit check --update\n\n\nenvironment:\n  RAILS_ENV: test\n  GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: a\n  GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: b\n  LANG: C.UTF-8\n\nand builds the Jenkinsfile to get your job running on the fly.\n\nThe nice part about having a shared library is that we can extend and\nfix our library in a centralized way. Once we add new code, the library\nis automatically updated in Jenkins which will notify all of our jobs\nwith the update.\n\nSince we have projects in different languages we use Docker to build the\ntesting environment. WoloxCI assumes there is a Dockerfile to build and\nwill run all the specified commands inside the container.\n\nWoloxci config.yml\n\nConfig\n\nThe first part of the config.yml file specifies some basic\nconfiguration: project’s name and Dockerfile location. The Dockerfile is\nused to build the image where the commands will be run.\n\nServices\n\nThis section describes which services will be exposed to the container.\nOut of the box, WoloxCI has support for postgresql, mssql and\nredis. You can also specify the docker image version you want! It is\nnot hard to add a new service. You just need to add the corresponding\nfile at\n\nhttps://github.com/Wolox/wolox-ci/tree/development/vars\n\nand modify how the services are parsed\n\nhttps://github.com/Wolox/wolox-ci/blob/development/src/com/wolox/parser/ConfigParser.groovy#L76\n\nSteps\n\nThe listed commands in this section will run inside the Docker\ncontainer. As a result, you’ll see each of the steps on the Jenkins UI.\n\nEnvironment\n\nIf you need some environment variables during your build, you can\nspecify them here. Whatever variable you set will be available inside\nthe Docker container when your commands listed in the steps section\ndescribed above.\n\nWrapping up\n\nWoloxCI is still being tested with a not-so-small sample of our\nprojects. The possibility of changing the build steps through a YAML\nfile makes it accessible for everyone and that is a great improvement in\nour CI workflow.\n\nDocker gives us the possibility of easily changing the programming\nlanguage without making any changes to our Jenkins installation and\nJenkins’ Github Organization feature automatically adds new projects\nwhen a new repository with a Jenkinsfile is detected.\n\nAll of these improvements have reduced the time we spend maintaining\nJenkins significantly and give us the possibility of easily scaling\nwithout any extra configuration.\n\nThis library is working in our CI but it still can be improved.\nIf you would like to add features, feel free to\ncontribute!","title":"Configuring a Jenkins Pipeline using a YAML file","tags":["jenkins","pipelines","yaml","sharedlibrary"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"mdesanti","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Head of Infrastructure &amp; Cloud at <a href=\"https://www.wolox.com.ar\">Wolox</a></p>\n</div>","id":"mdesanti","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Matias De Santi","slug":"/blog/authors/mdesanti/","twitter":"mdsanti"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"mdesanti","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
