I am based out of the Seattle area and am excited to be\nworking on Jenkins. :D We released version 1.5.0 of the Blue Ocean plugin late last week. If you’re\nusing Blue Ocean, you’ll want to grab this update since it includes many\nimprovements and bug fixes!\n\nNew Features\n\nBlue Ocean now includes a user interface update to show the downstream jobs\nlaunched with the 'build' step\n(link: JENKINS-38339)\n\nWith Blue Ocean 1.5.0, users can now Reorder Steps in the Blue Ocean Pipeline\nEditor simply by dragging and dropping steps to reorder them in the list of\nsteps.\n( JENKINS-38323)\n\nThe \"Artifacts\" tab also now supports pagination, which allows developers to\npaginate through the Artifacts tab. Previously, this list\nwas cut off at 100 entries.\n( JENKINS-43588)\n\nImprovements\n\nWe were able to include two performance improvements in 1.5.0 which reduce the\nDashboard loading time in Blue Ocean:\n\nJENKINS-44995\n\nJENKINS-48868\n\nSupport for viewing output for failed runs with no stages is also included in\nthis release. For developers who have no stages/steps defined in their\npipelines, they can now see the full log output for failed runs. This update\nhelps with Pipeline debugging in Jenkins.\n( JENKINS-48074)\n\nFurther improving the log output for Pipeline Runs, 1.5.0 also improves viewing\nof long log output lines with wrapping.  Previously, a single, long line of\noutput in the log wouldn’t be fully visible in the log window.\n( JENKINS-49036)\n\nFixes\n\nOne notable bug fix we addressed in this release was that input steps in\npost directives would not properly prompt for input. By fixing\nJENKINS-49297\nusers of Declarative Pipeline with Blue Ocean can include input steps in\ntheir post directives.\n\nThe full detailed change log can be viewed on the\nBlue Ocean plugin page\n\nUpdate Your Plugin\n\nPlugin updates in Jenkins are available in the Plugin Manager Update Center. This page includes instructions for using the UI and CLI to update your plugins: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/.\n\nIf you are using the Blue Ocean UI, click Administration in the page’s header to open Plugin Manager.\n\nInstalling the primary Blue Ocean plugin will update its dependencies as well.\n\nProviding Feedback\n\nChat with us at Gitter: https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin\n\nReport issues at https://issues.jenkins.io/","title":"Faster sailing on Blue Ocean 1.5.0","tags":["blueocean"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"jennbriden","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenn Briden is located in the Seattle area and is the Product Manager for the Blue Ocean plugin and the Jenkins pipeline.
