Just deploy a Docker container.\nInfrastructure is missing resources? Apply a Terraform recipe to allocate more on your favourite Cloud.\n\nWhat about the Jenkins administrator role in this context? Should they still spend hours in the web UI, clicking checkboxes on web forms? Maybe they already adopted some automation, relying on Groovy script voodoo, or some home-made XML templating?\n\nEarly this year we announced the first alpha release of “Jenkins Configuration-as-Code” (JCasC), a fresh new approach to Jenkins configuration management, based on YAML configuration files and automatic model discovery.\n“JCasC” has been promoted as a\ntop-level Jenkins project, and the corresponding\nJenkins Enhancement Proposal has been accepted.\n\nWhat can JCasC do for our Jenkins Administrator?\n\nJCasC allows us to apply a set of YAML files on our Jenkins controller at startup or on-demand via the web UI.\nThose configuration files are very concise and human readable compared to verbose XML files the Jenkins uses to actually store configuration.\nThe files also have user-friendly naming conventions making it easy for administrators to configure all Jenkins components.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\njenkins:\n systemMessage: \"Jenkins managed by Configuration as Code\"\n\n securityRealm:\n   ldap:\n     configurations:\n       - server: ldap.acme.com\n         rootDN: dc=acme,dc=fr\n         managerPasswordSecret: ${LDAP_PASSWORD}\n     cache:\n       size: 100\n       ttl: 10\n     userIdStrategy: CaseInsensitive\n     groupIdStrategy: CaseSensitive\n\nAs you can see, you don’t need long explanation to understand how this YAML file will setup your Jenkins controller.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe most immediate benefit of JCasC is reproducibility.\nAn administrator can now bootstrap a new Jenkins controller with the exact same configuration with a trivial setup.\nThis allows them to create a test instance and check the impact of plugin upgrades in a sandboxed environment.\nThis also lets them be more confident with failover and disaster recovery scenarios.\n\nFurther benefits come when administrators start managing their Jenkins’ YAML configuration files in source control, like they do with Terraform configuration.\nDoing so gives them auditing and reversibility of their Jenkins controller configuration.\nTheycan establish a sane configuration change workflow that runs a test Jenkins instance and ensures configuration is healthy before actually applying any change to their production Jenkins controller.\n\nLast but not least, with ability to quickly setup Jenkins controllers and control them from a set of shared YAML configuration files, administrators can now offer per-team Jenkins instances, with more flexibility on installed plugins.\nA controller becomes more or less a transient piece of infrastructure for your team, as long as they also manage build definition with Jenkinsfiles.\n\nWith Configuration-as-Code we can stop having to treat our Jenkins controller like a pet we need to pamper, and start managing Jenkins controllers as cattle you can replace without effort nor impacts.\nWelcome in the “as-code” world.\n\nFigure 1. They are still cute though, right?\n\nOk, so what’s next?\n\nYou can read more about the Jenkins Configuration-as-Code plugin on the project’s\ngithub repository.\nTo chat with the community and contributors join our\ngitter channel,\nor come see us in person at\nlink: Jenkins World to discuss the JCasC project and its future!\n\nAlso don’t miss next post from the Configuration-as-Code series, where we’ll look at how JCasC works with sensitive data like passwords and other credentials.\n\nCome meet the Configuration as Code contributors, Nicolas de Loof and Ewelina Wilkosz at\nJenkins World on September 16-19th,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Jenkins Configuration-as-Code: Look ma, no hands","tags":["configuration-as-code","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2018"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"ndeloof","html":"","id":"ndeloof","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Nicolas De Loof","slug":"/blog/authors/ndeloof/","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","id":"63d0593a-8c6c-5de0-8378-c28c4b7c4062","slug":"/blog/2012/09/12/jenkins-user-event-cph/","strippedHtml":"This article was originally posted on my personal blog\n\n+\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U254sLok_CA/UEyaAzMGpYI/AAAAAAAAHuI/--wuCdF0j2Y/s1600/IMAG0397.jpg[image:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U254sLok_CA/UEyaAzMGpYI/AAAAAAAAHuI/--wuCdF0j2Y/s640/IMAG0397.jpg[image,width=640,height=102]]\n\n+\n +\n +\nLast week, https://www.praqma.com/[praqma] was organizing in Copenhague a \"Jenkins User Event\".

I contribute a group to solve an integration issue by https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/558[creating a new extension] point in jenkins-core. Those already confident with jenkins development helped to write this code, some discovered the extension point design as well as way to contribute to jenkins (github pull request, etc), some were looking at jenkins source code for first time so learned a lot. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8aFBYs3PV2I/UEyZp3x53sI/AAAAAAAAHuA/T0_1zOKFVn8/s1600/IMAG0391.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8aFBYs3PV2I/UEyZp3x53sI/AAAAAAAAHuA/T0_1zOKFVn8/s640/IMAG0391.jpg[image,width=640,height=292]]\n\n+\n +\n +\n +\n +\nDay ended with beer then a chinese restaurant (typical Danish food :P), with lots of fun and nice discussions. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://www.praqma.com/sites/default/files/img/event_logo.png[image:https://www.praqma.com/sites/default/files/img/event_logo.png[image,width=320,height=138]]\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\nFriday was the Jenkins User Event. To reduce costs for such an event, compared to other Jenkins Conferences organized by CloudBees this year, lunch was not provided and conference program was \"packed\" into afternoon. This let praqma get a \"reasonable\" cost for this nice event, but still have a high quality conference, with printed programs, goodies, and coffee break. All praqma team was involved to make this event as pleasant as possible for all attendees, thanks a lot to them for contributing ! +\n +\n +\n +\nConference was sold-out on friday morning, with 80 attendees. +\n +\n +\n +\nAfter Lars Kruse welcome speak, and CloudBees to announce partnership with Praqma for DK, the conference started with two options : either an introduction to Jenkins, or an open-space discussion (~barcamp-like) for those that already know it well. I joined a small group first discussing about pre-tested commit, and then we divert speaking about best-practices, job and test performances issues, etc. Was a great exchange with interesting feedback. +\n +\n +\n +\nThe rest of the conference was single-track. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oCA1lQnDBeE/UEybtag0JmI/AAAAAAAAHuY/QSofsZ_ae1M/s1600/IMAG0408.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oCA1lQnDBeE/UEybtag0JmI/AAAAAAAAHuY/QSofsZ_ae1M/s400/IMAG0408.jpg[image,width=400,height=300]]\n\n+\n +\n +\n1rst session was about \"_facilitate strategic reuse of software_\" using jenkins CI. This session exposed how a industrial company changed it's internal software development practices and team organization to share components and be more efficient. This for sure introduced some coordinations and integration costs but resulted in a significant productivity improvement. This talk was interesting as it demonstrate that highly industrial companies (here, a low energy consuming water pumps producer) today follow development practice to share component and use continuous integration practice to help. I just wondered speaker said \"Clearcase facilitated\" sharing components  -I wouldn't expected those two words in same sentence :P +\n +\n +\n +\n\"_Tales from the trenches_\" was a funny session explaining how Nokia came from stone age (manual integration with code freezes) to modern development practices. After reinventing the wheel with ~15 home made, perl-script based CI tools, they switched to Jenkins and Git as common tooling. Explanation on Git selection, evaluating multiple DVCS popularity, then migration from ClearCase, [.underline]#helping a lot# early adopters, and later evaluating benefits (1 day / week / developer) was very interesting. Conclusion was that, \"some tools a radically better\" and \"deep process renewal depends heavily on tools renewal\". +\n +\n +\n +\n\"_Continuous Code Inspection_\" talk explained use of industrial C++ coding standard and normative coding convention, with dedicated analysis tools. After explanation on those rules and tooling, a dedicated jenkins plugin was demonstrated. Such jenkins integration makes QA mostly a single checkbox to enable, and provide history graphs, reports, and external tools integration. Introduction was a little slow imho but content was demonstrating the power of jenkins plugin model to adapt software factory to specific industrial needs. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vgq2K5JLj30/UEyfE86usmI/AAAAAAAAHuw/q4vbgqguyuY/s1600/IMAG0409.jpg[image:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vgq2K5JLj30/UEyfE86usmI/AAAAAAAAHuw/q4vbgqguyuY/s320/IMAG0409.jpg[image,width=320,height=240]]\n\n+\n +\n +\nCoffee break with delicious Danish chocolates ... +\n +\n +\n +\nSony was presenting its \"_Huge Jenkins Cluster_\", with 4 controllers, some of them handling up to 6000 jobs, 300 agents, 7000 builds a day an executing 175,000 tests a day for android platforms. Development teams use a dedicated agent machine with android devices connected through USB. +\n +\n +\n +\nSuch a build farm requires a dedicated support team and monitoring/maintenance tooling. IT only provides the computer and maintain the OS, but all Jenkins stuff is under the hands of a dedicated team. They evaluate plugins and core upgrades, educate teams, and analyse errors. +\n +\n +\n +\nWith 45Gb for a single full android build, they have to monitor available disk space, and developed maintenance scripts to delete old build artifacts and cleanup /tmp. They also use a local git mirror to speed-up cloning, and integrated with CFEngine-managed infrastructure to ensure no update occurs as a agent is running a build. They also significantly optimized build speed by switching from NFS to SAN, and are now evaluating XFS. +\n +\n +\n +\nRemaining issue is about jenkins build queue (subject discussed on Jenkins Code Camp) because a 9 in the morning, thousand users connect to jenkins controller and the UI widget to expose the queue status hits the queue synchronisation bottleneck. +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\nNext talk was mine, exposing https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb[Jenkins Enterprise] and demonstrating one ouf our Enterprise plugins. I'm not pleased by my talk, both because my english is crappy (maybe you already noticed?) and also because I was not confident with the standard JE slides. Assuming I had more time to prepare this talk, and as a tribute to this Danish event, I'd have used a bunch of lego bricks pictures to present Cloudbee plugins. So I quickly left the slides to run a demo, setting-up Jenkins Enterprise to run https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb[pre-tested commits]. Hope you enjoyed the talk. +\n +\n +\n +\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mnHy9gx9uGw/UEyixY_2Q0I/AAAAAAAAHvI/_KDQbGOTjw8/s1600/IMAG0407.jpg[image:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mnHy9gx9uGw/UEyixY_2Q0I/AAAAAAAAHvI/_KDQbGOTjw8/s320/IMAG0407.jpg[image,width=240,height=320]]Last talk was Lars one, exposing praqma \"_Corporate approach to opensource_\". This light, generalist talk was welcome as last one after a heavy-technical afternoon. Lars exposed reason to switch to open-source : +\n +\n +\n +\n\ncosts - for sure,\n\nbut also open standards and interoperability,\n\nand contribution to public good.\n\n+\nThis last point distinguish \"_innovators_\" that create new content and contribute to the oss project, and \"_free riders_\" that only want to save money and consume other efforts. Lars didn't went deeper into what \"contributing\" can be about, but spending some time joining the mailing lists, exposing detailled bug report, or writing blogs or documentation about the issues you encounter is already a huge contribution to opensource. Organizing such a great user event also is ;) +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\nMeeting ended with a \"socialize\" time, sponsored by Pragmatic Research, with beer and sandwiches. A nice time to discuss with speakers, know a face to match an #irc nickname, discuss about everything geeks like to discuss about, and round off this pleasant day. +","title":"Jenkins User Event CPH","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"ndeloof","html":"","id":"ndeloof","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Nicolas De Loof","slug":"/blog/authors/ndeloof/","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9dd8e64b-25a5-5c9d-ac5c-986d5bbd86be","slug":"/blog/2012/02/13/jenkins-user-conference-2012-paris/","strippedHtml":"+ +\n\n+\n(English text follows the French text) +\n +\n\n+\nAprès le succès de la https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011-session-abstracts.cb[Jenkins User Conference l’an dernier à San Francisco] et à l’intérêt qu’elle a soulevé, nous organisons cette année la JUC dans quatre grande villes à travers le monde.
