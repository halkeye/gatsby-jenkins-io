We want to capture the details of your DevOps experience in order to provide valuable insights to the Jenkins Community and beyond. Our community is stronger together - and this look at our collective experience will reveal the big picture and shine a light on key trends. This year, as the Jenkins project continues to evolve with Jenkins X , Configuration as Code and more, your input is more critical than ever.\n\nLet’s look at what we learned in 2016 and 2017:\n\nIn 2016 we found that:\n\nJenkins continued to hold the position as a company standard orchestration solution.\n\n29% of respondents companies use Jenkins on more than 50 projects\n\nIn regards to SCM tools, Git continued the march to dominance:\n\nGit usage increased to 85%\n\nSubversion usage decreased to 35%\n\nWhen it comes to practices, Agile and CI seemed to be the standard, and CD adoption still had a ways to go:\n\n85% practiced Agile\n\n82% practiced CI\n\n61% practiced DevOps\n\n46% practiced CD\n\nIn 2017 respondents reported that:\n\nJenkins Pipeline gained widespread adoption with 89% of survey takers used pipeline or planned to use in 6 months or less.\n\nContainer technology was cemented as a key part of the CD/DevOps ecosystem, yet Kubernetes usage was just starting gain momentum at 20.15%:\n\nJenkins, CD, and DevOps are getting more attention from Architects with 39% of respondents identified as Architects, nearly double the previous year\n\nGit was the clear SCM of choice at 90%, increasing nearly 5% over last the previous year\n\nWhat will you and the community tell us this year?  Are more people practicing DevOps?  Is Kubernetes the leader in container orchestration?  Is pipeline the standard for creating workflows?  Take the survey and let’s find out!\n\nAs always, your personal information (name, email address and company) will NOT be used by CloudBees for sales or marketing and the survey results will be made publicly available to the Jenkins Community. We will also be publishing a blog series analyzing trends over the last 5 years and offering  predictions on the evolution of DevOps. If you’re curious about what insights your input will provide, see the results of last year’s 2017 survey.\n\nAs an added incentive to participate, CloudBees will enter participants into a drawing for a free pass to DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 (1st prize, $1,199.00 value) or a $100 Amazon gift card (2nd prize)!\n\nThe survey will close at the end of October so grab a cup of coffee get started. We promise the survey will be done before your latte is.\n\nTake me to the survey.\n\nThere are laws that govern prize giveaways and eligibility; CloudBees has compiled all those fancy terms and conditions here.","title":"2018 DevOps|Jenkins Community Survey Now Open","tags":["jenkins","devops","jenkinsworld2018"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"bvdawson","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>DevOps dude at CloudBees.\nJenkins Marketing Manager.\nTools geek.</p>\n</div>","id":"bvdawson","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Brian Dawson","slug":"/blog/authors/bvdawson","twitter":"brianvdawson"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","id":"76ba3f00-38ff-54a3-ba40-edf86486b934","slug":"/blog/2017/08/29/2017-community-survey/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Brian\nDawson on behalf of CloudBees, where he works as a DevOps Evangelist\nresponsible for developing and sharing continuous delivery and DevOps best\npractices.

He also\nserves as the CloudBees Product Marketing Manager for Jenkins.\n\nLast fall CloudBees asked attendees at the Jenkins User Conference – US West\n(JUC), and other in the Jenkins community to take a survey.  Almost 250 people\ndid – and thanks to their input, we have results which provided interesting\ninsights into how Jenkins is being used.\n\nBack in 2012, at the time of the last community survey, 83% of respondents felt\nthat Jenkins was mission-critical. By 2015, the percentage saying that\nJenkins was mission-critical was 92%. Additionally, echoing the\nimportance of Jenkins, 89% of respondents said their use of Jenkins had\nincreased over the last year, while 11% said it had stayed the same. 0%\nsaid that it had decreased.\n\nThe trend in the industry over the last couple of years has been to adopt\ncontinuous delivery (CD), thus pushing automation further down the pipeline –\nfrom development all the way into production.  Jenkins being an automation\nengine applicable to any phase of the software delivery lifecycle, is readily\nsupporting this trend. Jenkins' extensible architecture and unparalleled plugin\necosystem enables integration with and orchestration of practically any tool in\nany phase of software delivery.\n\nThe trend towards adoption of CD is clearly reflected amongst the community: 59%\nof respondents are using Jenkins for continuous integration (CI), but an\nadditional 30% have extended CI into CD and are manually deploying code to\nproduction.  Finally, 11% are practicing continuous deployment – they have\nextended CI to CD and are deploying code automatically into production.\n\nAnother trend tied to the adoption of CD and DevOps is the frequent deployment\nof incremental releases to production. 26% of those respondents using continuous\ndelivery practices are deploying code at least once per day.  Another 37% are\ndeploying code at least once per week.\n\nIn keeping with the move to CD, 30% of survey takers are already using the\nrelatively new Pipeline plugin to automate their\nsoftware delivery pipelines.  Of those not using the Pipeline plugin, 79% plan\nto adopt it in the next 12 months.\n\nSurvey respondents are also using Jenkins for many different activities.  97% of\nsurvey takers use it for \"build\" – no surprise, since that is where Jenkins got\nits start - but 58% now also use it for their deployment.\n\nWhen the 2012 community survey was conducted, container technology was not as\nwell understood as it is today,  and many didn’t know what a “Docker” was. A\nshort four years later, 96% of survey respondents who use Linux containers are\nusing Docker.  Container technology has seen impressive adoption and arguably is\nrevolutionizing the way application infrastructure is delivered.  When coupled\nwith Jenkins as an automation engine, containers help accelerate software\ndelivery by providing rapid access to lightweight environments.  The Jenkins\ncommunity has recognized and embraced the power of containers by\nproviding plugins for Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nThe Jenkins improvements which survey respondents desired the most were\nquality/timely bug fixes, a better UI and more documentation/examples.\nInterestingly, Jenkins 2.0 - which is just about to officially launch,\nprovides UI improvements and the new Jenkins.io website\nprovides improved, centralized documentation.\n\nFinally, the respondents favorite Star Wars character was R2-D2, followed by\nObi-Wan and Darth Vader. Yoda and Han Solo also got a fair amount of votes. The\nvotes for Jar-Jar Binks and Jabba the Hutt left us puzzled. Notably, BB-8 had a\nwrite-in vote despite the fact the new Star Wars movie hadn’t been released yet.\n\nAs to where the community is headed, our prediction is that by the next Jenkins Community Survey:\n\nMore Jenkins users will have transitioned from just continuous\nintegration to continuous delivery with some evening practicing continuous\ndeployment\n\nPipeline plugin adoption and improvements will continue, leading to\npipeline-as-code becoming an essential solution for automating the software\n(and infrastructure) delivery process\n\nThere will be a significant increase in use of the Docker plugin to support\nelastic Jenkins infrastructure and continuous delivery of containers using\nsoftware development best practices\n\nBB-8 will be the next favorite Star Wars character! <3</p>\n\nSee you at Jenkins World, September 13-15, in Santa Clara, California!\nRegister now for the largest Jenkins event on the planet in 2016 – and get the Early Bird discount.
