Maybe a new plugin is needed, or I need to update an existing plugin.\nOr, I want to upload a plugin from my computer. For all these cases, I just don’t need a UI or even a browser.\nI like to use a CLI to complete most of my tasks. For example, I use kubectl to manage my Kubernetes cluster,\nto create or modify the kubernetes resources. So, I start to think, 'Why not use a CLI to manage my Jenkins?'.\n\nWhy create a new one?\n\nFirst, I almost forgot about the existing Jenkins CLI, written in Java. Let me introduce how to use that one.\n\nVisit Jenkins page from http://localhost:8080/jenkins/cli/ . You’ll see a command like java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/jenkins/ help. So, a jar file needs to be download.\nWe can use this command to complete this task wget http://localhost:8080/jenkins/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar .\n\nNow you can see that this is not a Linux-style CLI. Please consider some points below:\n\nThe users must have a JRE. This is not convenient for developers who don’t use Java.\n\nThe CLI is too wordy. We always need to type java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/jenkins/ as the initial command.\n\nCannot install it by some popular package manager, like brew or yum.\n\nOf course, the Java CLI client is more native with Jenkins. But I’d like to use this more easily.\nSo I decided to create a new CLI tool which would be written in Go and which would natively run on modern platforms.\n\nThat’s the story of creating jcli.\n\nFeatures\n\nEasy to maintain config file for jcli\n\nMultiple Jenkins support\n\nPlugins management (list, search, install, upload)\n\nJob management (search, build, log)\n\nOpen your Jenkins with a browser\n\nRestart your Jenkins\n\nConnection with proxy support\n\nHow to get it?\n\nYou can clone jcli from the jenkins-cli repo. For now, we support\nthese three most popular OS platforms: MacOS, Linux, and Windows.\n\nMacOS\n\nYou can use brew to install jcli.\n\nbrew tap jenkins-zh/jcli\nbrew install jcli\n\nLinux\n\nIt’s very simple to install jcli into your Linux OS. Just need to execute a command line at below:\n\ncurl -L https://github.com/jenkins-zh/jenkins-cli/releases/latest/download/jcli-linux-amd64.tar.gz|tar xzv\nsudo mv jcli /usr/local/bin/\n\nWindows\n\nYou can find the latest version by clicking here. Then download the tar file, cp the uncompressed jcli directory into your system path.\n\nHow to get started?\n\nIt’s very simple to use this. Once you get jcli on your computer, use this command to generate a sample configuration:\n\n$ jcli config generate\ncurrent: yourServer\njenkins_servers:\n- name: yourServer\n  url: http://localhost:8080/jenkins\n  username: admin\n  token: 111e3a2f0231198855dceaff96f20540a9\n  proxy: \"\"\n  proxyAuth: \"\"\n# Goto 'http://localhost:8080/jenkins/me/configure', then you can generate your token.\n\nIn most cases, you should modify three fields which are url, username and token. OK, I believe you’re ready. Please check whether you install the github plugin in your Jenkins:\n\njcli plugin list --filter name=github\n\nThat’s the end. It’s still in very early development stage. Any contribution is welcome.","title":"Managing Jenkins with jcli","tags":["general","jcli","cli","tools"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#989898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/77b35/linuxsuren.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/d4a57/linuxsuren.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/68974/linuxsuren.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/ef6ff/linuxsuren.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/8257c/linuxsuren.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/6766a/linuxsuren.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/22bfc/linuxsuren.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/linuxsuren.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"LinuxSuRen","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Rick is a big fan of Jenkins, also as a contributor leading the Jenkins China community.</p>\n</div>","id":"linuxsuren","irc":null,"linkedin":"linuxsuren","name":"赵晓杰(Rick)","slug":"/blog/authors/linuxsuren","twitter":"LinuxSuRen"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"38964a5b-f559-5f17-9f39-7c96117907bb","slug":"/blog/2019/05/09/chinese-localization/","strippedHtml":"Since 2017, I started to do some contributions to the Jenkins community. As a beginner, translation might be\nthe easiest way to help the project. You don’t need to understand the whole context, even to create a ticket in the\nissue tracker system. Improvement of localization usually is minor. But some problems occurred soon,\nthere isn’t a native speaker of Chinese that could review my PRs. So, sometimes my PRs\nare delayed from being merged into master.\n\nSome contributors told me that I can start a thread at the mailing list. Normally, discussing at the mailing list\nis the open source community way. We got a lot of ideas for the localization from there. As a result,\nwe achieved some goals that I’d like to share here.\n\nJEP-216\n\nPreviously, language localization files were distributed in core and in each plugin.\nFor this proposal, each language has a single localization plugin, such as Chinese Localization plugin.\nFinally, Localization Support Plugin and\nChinese Localization plugin are able to support\nall types of localization resource files. From the plugins website,\nyou can see that there are already 13 000 installations.\nWe removed all Chinese localization files at the PR-4008.\n\nI really appreciate Daniel Beck for helping me to add localization support,\nLiam Newman helping me to review JEP-216, and many other community members.\n\nChinese Localization SIG\n\nWe believe that this SIG could help to improve Jenkins experience for Chinese users and gather more contributors\nfrom China. This SIG is responsible for maintaining the Chinese Jenkins website,\npromoting the Jenkins community in China in the social media with WeChat account. We publish translated blog\narticles, Jenkins release notes, JAM or other events at the WeChat account. For now, there are 1800 followers that can\nread our news from the last half a year.\n\nEspecially, I want to say thanks to Wang Donghui, Zhai Zhijun, and other contributors. They did a lot of contributions.\nI wish I could see more and more folks join us.","title":"A Big Step of the Chinese Localization","tags":["general","community","localization","chinese"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#989898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/77b35/linuxsuren.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/d4a57/linuxsuren.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/68974/linuxsuren.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/ef6ff/linuxsuren.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/8257c/linuxsuren.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/6766a/linuxsuren.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/22bfc/linuxsuren.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/linuxsuren.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"LinuxSuRen","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Rick is a big fan of Jenkins, also as a contributor leading the Jenkins China community.</p>\n</div>","id":"linuxsuren","irc":null,"linkedin":"linuxsuren","name":"赵晓杰(Rick)","slug":"/blog/authors/linuxsuren","twitter":"LinuxSuRen"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9488675b-0d5a-5055-8c7d-1ab61e7ad642","slug":"/blog/2019/02/05/jenkins-new-year-in-china/","strippedHtml":"At the time of the Spring Festival. I want to make a summary of some activities in the last year.\nYou might already notice that more and more Chinese contributors emerge in the Jenkins community.\nWe have a GSoC champion who is Shenyu Zheng.\nHe is a great example for other students. With the effort of three skilled engineers,\nmany Jenkins users could learn the edge technologies and useful use cases.\nThey co-organized several Jenkins Meetups in a couple of cities in China.\n\nThere are two workshops about Jenkins and Jenkins X in the DevOps International Summit. James Rawlings gave us a wonderful view of the Jenkins X. Many people start to know this project. The Chinese website of jx would be helpful to those people.\n\nOn November 3rd, 2018 the Jenkins User Conference China(JUCC) was hosted in Shenzhen. More than 200 attendees gathered at JUCC to share and discuss Jenkins, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Pipeline, and Agile.\n\nThere was a Jenkins workshop to teach users to develop a plugin in October. It was during the Hacktoberfest 2018. So some people got a beautiful T-shirt at this meetup. We’ll keep this event in 2019. I hope more users and developers could join us.\n\nThank you all folks. And other friendly contributors.\n\nChinese is our main communication language. A large number of the Jenkins users are not a proficient English speaker.\nSo letting most of Chinese Jenkins users could easily use Jenkins as their CI/CD platform is the final mission of Chinese Localization SIG.\nYou can find three participants on the page. But that’s not the full list.\nMore exciting thing is that Alauda giving a big support which as a startup company.\n\nWeChat is the greatest social media channel in China. WeChat has one billion users.\nAlmost everyone in China has a WeChat account. It must be a perfect place to publish articles and events.\nThere are over 1k people subscribed the Jenkins official WeChat Subscription Account in the last three months.\n\nIn the new year, I’m looking forward to growing up with you all!","title":"Jenkins new year in China","tags":["core","community","chinese"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#989898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/77b35/linuxsuren.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/d4a57/linuxsuren.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/68974/linuxsuren.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/ef6ff/linuxsuren.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/8257c/linuxsuren.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/6766a/linuxsuren.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/22bfc/linuxsuren.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/linuxsuren.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"LinuxSuRen","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Rick is a big fan of Jenkins, also as a contributor leading the Jenkins China community.</p>\n</div>","id":"linuxsuren","irc":null,"linkedin":"linuxsuren","name":"赵晓杰(Rick)","slug":"/blog/authors/linuxsuren","twitter":"LinuxSuRen"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"linuxsuren","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
