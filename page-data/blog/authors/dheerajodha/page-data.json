Jenkins project provides Docker images for controllers, inbound agents, outbound agents, and more.\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.307 released August 17, 2021 and Jenkins 2.303.1 released August 25, 2021, the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project will use Java 11 instead of Java 8.\n\nControllers use Java 11 by default\n\nIf you are running one of the Jenkins Docker controller images that does not include a JDK version in its label, the Java runtime will switch from Java 8 to Java 11 with the upgrade.\n\nFor example:\n\nJenkins 2.306 running as jenkins/jenkins:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.307 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:latest, it will use Java 11\n\nJenkins 2.289.3 running as jenkins/jenkins:lts uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.303.1 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:lts, it will use Java 11\n\nThe Docker image tags affected by this upgrade include:\n\nalpine\n\ncentos7\n\nlatest\n\nlts\n\nslim\n\nUsers that need to remain with Java 8 may use a different Docker image tag to run with Java 8.\n\nJenkins 2.306 running as jenkins/jenkins:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.307 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:latest-jdk8, it will use Java 8\n\nJenkins 2.289.3 running as jenkins/jenkins:lts uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.303.1 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk8, it will use Java 8\n\nAgents use Java 11 by default\n\nDuring the next 1-2 weeks (Aug 17, 2021 - Aug 31, 2021), the Jenkins agent images will be updated to use Java 11 instead of Java 8.\n\nFor example:\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.9-1 uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.10-1 it will use Java 11.\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:latest after the agent change, it will use Java 11.\n\nUsers that need to remain with Java 8 may use a different Docker image tag to run with Java 8.\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.9-1 uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.10-1-jdk8 it will also use Java 8.\n\nDocker tag updates stopped\n\nThe Jenkins project will no longer update the Docker images that are based on CentOS 8.\nThe CentOS project has changed direction to track just ahead of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux release rather than tracking after a release.\nThey are no longer publishing updates for CentOS 8 Docker images.\n\nUsers running Jenkins 2.306 or earlier with the jenkins/jenkins:centos tag will need to switch to use a different tag.\nThey may consider using:\n\njenkins/jenkins:almalinux\n\njenkins/jenkins:rhel-ubi8-jdk11\n\nUsers running Jenkins 2.289.3 or earlier with the jenkins/jenkins:centos tag will need to switch to use a different tag\n\nThey may consider using:\n\njenkins/jenkins:lts-almalinux\n\njenkins/jenkins:lts-rhel-ubi8-jdk11\n\nWindow 1809 Docker images stopped\n\nThe Windows Docker images have published versions based on both the 1809 feature release and the Windows Server long term support channel (\"LTSC\").\nWindows support for the 1809 images will no longer be published because Microsoft has ended mainstream support for the 1809 images.\nUsers should switch to use the Jenkins images based on the \"LTSC\" channel.","title":"Docker images use Java 11 by

Updating the jenkins.yaml file\n\nReload the existing configuration to apply the system message change\n\nNow, go back to the Dashboard and you can see the updated System Message on top:\n\nFigure 2. Viewing the changes on Dashboard\n\nThis file will be used later to configure the plugin using JCasC.\n\nConfigure the plugin on the UI\n\nFor this demo, install the View Job Filters plugin.\n\nLet’s create a view by clicking on the New View option on the left side of the Dashboard.\n\nGive it a name (say, “testView”) and set its type to List View, and click on the OK button.\n\nFigure 3. Creating the View\n\nNow click on Add Job Filter to add any kind of filter, so let’s select Build Duration Filter and fill the field with any value (say, \"60\" minutes),\n\nFigure 4. Adding filter to the view\n\nClick on Apply Save.\n\nTo view the full configuration, check out your main jenkins.yaml configuration file, by clicking on Manage Jenkins Configuration as Code View Configuration\n\nGo to the views section in this YAML file to see details related to the view,\n\nFigure 5. Here, details regarding the view (which we just created) is visible\n\nDownload the Configuration\n\nNow that you have successfully configured your plugin by UI, let’s download the configuration by going to Manage Jenkins on the Dashboard, then click on Configuration as Code under \"System Configuration\".\n\nNow click on the Download Configuration button to save the configuration file locally.\n\nFigure 6. Downloading the Configuration\n\nUpdate JCasC file locally\n\nAdd some changes in your downloaded copy of the jenkins.yaml file, to see those changes being automatically reflected on the UI.\n\nFor demo purposes, let’s change the name to “YoutubeDemoView” and set the buildDurationMinutes as \"55\".\n\nFigure 7. Changing the View details locally\n\nSave the file.\n\nLoad the jenkins.yaml file on the Jenkins server\n\nNow to reflect the local changes done in the jenkins.yaml file onto the Jenkins server, click on the Reload existing configuration button.\n\nFigure 8. Applying the New Configuration to the Jenkins instance\n\nVerify the changes on the UI\n\nGo back to the main page by clicking on the Jenkins logo on the top-left side.\n\nAnd you will notice that the name of your view has been changed from \"testView\" to “YoutubeDemoView”,\n\nAnd the field value of Build Duration Filter has been changed from \"60\" to “55”.\n\nThese two are the exact changes that we did locally in our jenkins.yaml file.\n\nFigure 9. Verifying the changes\n\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully configured a plugin (“View Job Filter”) automatically with the help of the “Jenkins Configuration as Code” plugin! You can repeat the same process for other plugins as well.","title":"Configure Plugins with JCasC","tags":["jcasc","tutorial","plugins","yaml"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#586868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/55658/dheerajodha.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/3af71/dheerajodha.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/226ae/dheerajodha.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/55658/dheerajodha.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/3dc24/dheerajodha.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/bf13b/dheerajodha.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/12101/dheerajodha.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/e9db2/dheerajodha.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/6fafe/dheerajodha.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":145}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/dheerajodha.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"dheerajodha","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Dheeraj is a Computer Science Engineering student (senior) at Vivekanand Institute of Technology, University of Mumbai.
