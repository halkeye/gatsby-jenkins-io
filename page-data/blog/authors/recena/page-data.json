The visual changes are very subtle but behind them, there are interesting benefits.\n\nSome of the goals that we have tried to achieve:\n\nApplying a semantic HTML\n\nRemoving the tag usage for implementing layouts and content structures. Read this article if you want to know reasons and/or arguments.\n\nSmall re-styling focused on spacing, margins, composition, etc..\n\nAccessibility\n\nIn order to provide a quick overview of the visual changes, let’s take a look at these screenshots.\n\nSystem tray with administrative messages (before)\n\nSystem tray with administrative messages (after)\n\nManage Jenkins page (before)\n\nManage Jenkins page (after)\n\nInformation about how this change can affect the current implementations of Administrative Monitors can be found in the following section\n\nFor core developers\n\nLet’s use a real example for showing how this proposal works.\n\nThis is the original UI implementation of HudsonHomeDiskUsageMonitor.java :\n\n${%blurb(app.rootDir)}\n\nAnd this is the proposed change:\n\n${%blurb(app.rootDir)}\n\nSome highlights:\n\nNo more ad hoc UI compositions\n\nNo more custom CSS classes when Jenkins project is already using Bootstrap for many different things\n\nBased on Bootstrap Alert\n\nAll administrative monitors defined in Jenkins core have been adapted as part of this proposal.\n\nFor plugin developers\n\nNo changes are really needed, but we do recommend you to adapt your plugins to this proposal so Jenkins users have a better user experience.\n\nTaking into account that you want to keep backward compatibility, you will need some changes.\n\nIn your implementation of Administrative Monitor, add this helper method:\n\n/**\n * This method can be removed when the baseline is updated to 2.103\n *\n * @return If this version of the plugin is running on a Jenkins version where JENKINS-43786 is included.\n */\n @Restricted(DoNotUse.class)\n public boolean isTheNewDesignAvailable() {\n    if (Jenkins.getVersion().isNewerThan(new VersionNumber(\"2.103\"))) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\nIn your view (a.k.a. Jelly file or Groovy file):\n\nSSH Host Key Verifiers are not configured for all SSH agents on this Jenkins instance. This could leave these agents open to man-in-the-middle attacks. Update your agent configuration to resolve this.\n\nSSH Host Key Verifiers are not configured for all SSH agents on this Jenkins instance. This could leave these agents open to man-in-the-middle attacks. Update your agent configuration to resolve this.\n\nIf you don’t want to keep a strict backward compatibility, the impact is minimal. In fact, you can see an example on GitHub Plugin.\n\nSome helpful references:\n\nJIRA issue where the proposal was tracked\n\nPull Request with the change in Jenkins core. You can find several screenshots\n\nPull Request for adapting SSH Agent Plugin\n\nDo not hesitate to ping me if you decide to adapt your Administrative Monitors.","title":"Overhaul of Manage Jenkins page","tags":["jenkins","ui","restyling","upgrade"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"recena","html":"","id":"recena","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Manuel Recena","slug":"/blog/authors/recena/","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"recena","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
