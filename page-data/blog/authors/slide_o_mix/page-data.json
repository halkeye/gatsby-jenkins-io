Tyler Croy who step down from the Jenkins Governance Board this year.\nThanks to them for all contributions and for continued community leadership.\n\nStatement from Marky Jackson:\n\nIt is a tremendous honor to be elected to this roles. I am so humbled.\nBeing part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.\nMy goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.\nI look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.\n\n— Marky Jackson, Jenkins Governance Board Member and Events Officer\n\nStatement from Gavin Mogan:\n\nGavin here. I’m still in shock that I got voted in for the Jenkins board.\nIt felt like yesterday I just got started helping people randomly on IRC. This is truly exciting.\nI plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.\nThis is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.\nMy specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.\n\n— Gavin Mogan, Jenkins Governance Board Member\n\nOfficer election details\n\nAll 5 officer positions were up for election this year.\nThese roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2021.\nAfter the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,\n4 officer positions were uncontested:\n\nOlivier Vernin - Infrastructure officer.\n\nMarky Jackson - Events officer.\nMarky inherits this role from Alyssa Tong\nwho decided to step down from the officer role and to focus on the Jenkins community marketing,\nincluding Jenkins Is The Way and many other initiatives started by Alyssa.\n\nMark Waite - Documentation officer.\n\nDaniel Beck - Security officer.\n\nThanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!\nOfficers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.\nIt requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.\n\nRelease Officer election results\n\nTim Jacomb won the biggest support as a Release officer ( voting results).\nTim will replace in this role Oliver Gondža\nwho has been leading the Release Team and the release processes since 2016 when the role was officially introduced.\n\nTim Jacomb (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nBaptiste Mathus  loses to Tim Jacomb by 40–23\n\nVictor Martinez  loses to Tim Jacomb by 38–25, loses to Baptiste Mathus by 32–31\n\nHere is a statement from Tim Jacomb:\n\nI’m excited for the year ahead, let’s see where we can take the Jenkins release area in the future.\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation, ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team,\nand ensure that responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.\n\n— Tim Jacomb, Jenkins Release Officer\n\nThanks to Alyssa Tong and Oliver Gondža for their long-time service as Jenkins officers!\nWe are looking to continue working with them in the Jenkins community.\nAnd congratulations to Tim Jacomb and Marky Jackson for joining the team!\n\nStatistics\n\nThis year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.\nIt is significantly lower than in the 2019 elections when we had almost 350 voters.\nIt can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.\nThis year we decided to not use the previous voter registration system,\nand we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.\nThis is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nThe last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.\nWith help of many contributors and with the renewed board,\nwe have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,\nfor example hosting contributor summits,\npublishing the public roadmap,\nCode of Conduct update,\nterminology changes,\nand graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.\nThere is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.\n\nIn short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.\n\nThere are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:\nlong-anticipated features and architecture changes,\nchanging the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process,\ncreating better communication channels with Jenkins users,\nand onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to contribute!\n\nFeedback\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe will appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process so that we can improve the process.\nWe have started a Retrospective document for these elections.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\nThere will be also a public retrospective review at the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meeting on Dec 17.\n\nIf you have any private feedback you would like to share,\nplease send an email to the Jenkins Board.\nIf you would like to raise any issues about the election process,\nplease contact one of the elected Governance Board members.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2020 election

The full list of properties that can be overridden will be available soon.\n\nNext Steps\n\nWindows users have alternatives for their existing Jenkins installations:\n\nUpgrade from inside Jenkins\n\nThe \"Manage Jenkins\" section of the running Jenkins will continue to include an \"Upgrade\" button for Windows users.\nYou may continue to use that \"Upgrade\" button to update the Jenkins installation on your Windows computer.\nUpgrade from inside Jenkins will continue to use the current Java version.\nUpgrade from inside Jenkins will continue to use the current installation location.\n\nUpgrade with the new Jenkins MSI installer\n\nIf you run the new Jenkins MSI installer on your Jenkins that was installed with the old Jenkins MSI installer, it will prompt for a new port and a service account.\n\nStop and disable the existing Jenkins service from the Windows Service Manager\n\nRun the new installer to create the new installation with desired settings\n\nStop the newly installed Jenkins service\n\nCopy existing Jenkins configuration files to the new Jenkins home directory\n\nStart the newly installed Jenkins service\n\nAfter the new Jenkins MSI installer has run, the \"Manage Jenkins\" section of the running Jenkins will continue to include an \"Upgrade\" button for Windows users.\nYou may continue to use that \"Upgrade\" button to update the Jenkins installation on your Windows computer.","title":"Windows Installer Upgrades","tags":["windows","platform-sig","installers","announcement"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/12e9c9639e24d63b0e20a2f8f7f0116d/c09ea/vsilverman.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/12e9c9639e24d63b0e20a2f8f7f0116d/534e5/vsilverman.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/12e9c9639e24d63b0e20a2f8f7f0116d/99887/vsilverman.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/12e9c9639e24d63b0e20a2f8f7f0116d/c09ea/vsilverman.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/12e9c9639e24d63b0e20a2f8f7f0116d/76fd4/vsilverman.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/12e9c9639e24d63b0e20a2f8f7f0116d/59a6b/vsilverman.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/12e9c9639e24d63b0e20a2f8f7f0116d/cbb78/vsilverman.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/12e9c9639e24d63b0e20a2f8f7f0116d/96250/vsilverman.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/12e9c9639e24d63b0e20a2f8f7f0116d/50511/vsilverman.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":171}}},"blog":null,"github":"vsilverman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Vlad is an active user of Jenkins and at the beginning of 2020 he also started actively contributing to the Jenkins project.

This is most useful as a base image for other images.\nWindows images are available starting from version 4.3-4\n\njenkins/inbound-agent is an agent that is based on the jenkins/agent image above. It provides a wrapper script written in PowerShell to help specify the parameters to agent.jar.\nWindows images are available starting from version 4.3-4\n\njenkins/ssh-agent is an image which has OpenSSH installed and should be used with the SSH Build Agents Plugin.\nWindows images are available starting from version 2.1.0\n\nUsing Windows Docker images\n\nTo use the new images, you will need a proper Docker or Kubernetes environment which supports running Windows containers.\nFor Windows desktop users, the easiest way is to use Docker for Windows.\nWindows support in Kubernetes is documented here.\n\njenkins/agent\n\nThe jenkins/agent image is a simple agent with the JDK and the agent.jar (Jenkins Remoting library).\n\nThere are two main use cases for this image:\n\nAs a base image for other Docker images (e.g., FROM jenkins/agent:jdk8-nanoserver-1809 in your Dockerfile). The jenkins/inbound-agent is based on this image.\n\nThis image may also be used to launch an agent using the Launch method of Launch agent via execution of command on the master.  This allows the controller to launch the agent inside the docker container automatically.\n\nTo run the agent for the second use case, you would specify the following command on the Jenkins controller after setting Remote root directory to C:\\Users\\jenkins\\agent :\n\ndocker run -i --rm --name agent --init jenkins/agent:jdk8-windowsservercore-1809 java -jar C:/ProgramData/Jenkins/agent.jar\n\njenkins/inbound-agent\n\nThe inbound-agent Docker image tries to provide a higher level interaction with the agent.jar executable. It provides a PowerShell wrapper script around agent.jar and it is specified as the entrypoint so that you just need to pass in some command line arguments to run the agent. A pull request has been opened which documents these command line parameters and environment variables.\n\nExample:\n\ndocker run jenkins/inbound-agent:windowsservercore-1809 `\n   -Url http://jenkins-server:port `\n   -WorkDir=C:/Users/jenkins/Agent `\n   -Secret `\n   -Name\n\nExample using environment variables:\n\ndocker run -e \"JENKINS_URL=http://jenkins-server:port\" -e \"JENKINS_AGENT_NAME=AGENTNAME\" `\n   jenkins/inbound-agent:windowsservercore-1809 `\n   -WorkDir=C:/Users/jenkins/Agent `\n   -Secret `\n   -Name\n\nThe -Url, -Name and -Secret parameters are required, but can be specified as either command line parameters or environment variables.\n\njenkins/ssh-agent\n\nAs mentioned above the jenkins/ssh-agent docker image is based on SSH communication with the controller, rather than the remoting TCP or WebSocket protocols. The image sets up a jenkins user and the OpenSSH server so that the controller can connect to the agent via SSH. The image expects an SSH public key as a parameter and puts that key into the authorized_keys file for the jenkins user. The private key should be specified in the agent configuration on the controller to allow the controller to connect.\n\nExample:\n\ndocker run jenkins/ssh-agent:jdk8-windowsservercore-1809 \"\"\n\nYou can also pass the public key as an environment variable when using docker run.\n\nExample:\n\ndocker run -e \"JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=\" jenkins/ssh-agent:jdk8-windowsservercore-1809\n\nYou will then be able to connect this agent using the SSH Build Agents Plugin as \"jenkins\" with the matching private key.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe are considering providing versions based on Windows Server 2019 build 1909 so that Jenkins users can run these images on GKE clusters (see this issue).\n\nWe are also looking into providing multiarch manifests which would allow Windows images to be part of the latest tag.\n\nThere is also an open pull-request to create a Windows based Docker image for a Jenkins controller. There hasn’t been a lot of requests for this, but to make the offerings complete for Windows users, the pull request was created.\n\nFor plans unrelated to Windows, please see the Docker images for agents: New names and What’s next blogpost.","title":"Windows Docker Agent Images: General Availability","tags":["announcement","docker","platform-sig","windows"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#988878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/19e71/slide_o_mix.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/77b35/slide_o_mix.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/d4a57/slide_o_mix.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/19e71/slide_o_mix.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/ef6ff/slide_o_mix.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/8257c/slide_o_mix.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/6766a/slide_o_mix.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"slide","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Alex comes from a .NET background but likes to get his hands dirty in many different languages and frameworks.

This is the vast majority of Windows systems these days,\nso this will help more users install Jenkins using the installer package.\n\nThe user is now able to enter user information for the service and select the port that Jenkins will use and verify that the port is available.\n\nThe installer no longer bundles a JRE, but will search for a compatible JRE on the system. If the user wants to use a different JRE, they can specify during install.\n\nThe installer has support for running with a Java 11 JRE, including the components listed on the Java 11 Preview Page.\n\nthe JENKINS_HOME directory is placed in the LocalAppData directory for the user that the service will run as, this aligns with modern Windows file system layouts.\n\nThe installer has been updated with branding to make it look nicer and provide a better user experience.\n\nScreenshots\n\nBelow are screenshots of the new installer sequence:\n\nStep 1\n\nThe Jenkins logo is now a prominent part of the UI for the installer.\n\nStep 2\n\nThe Jenkins logo and name are now in the header during all phases of the installer.\n\nStep 3\n\nThe installer now allows you to specify the username/password for the account to run as and checks that the account has LogonAsService rights.\n\nStep 4\n\nThe installer also allows you to specify the port that Jenkins should run on and will not continue until a valid port is entered and tested.\n\nStep 5\n\nInstead of bundling a JRE, the installer now searches for a compatible JRE on the system (JRE 8 is the current search). If you want to use a different\nJRE on the system than the one found by the installer, you can browse and specify it. Only JRE 8 and JRE 11 runtimes are supported. The installer will\nautomatically add the necessary arguments and additional jar files for running under Java 11 if the selected JRE is found to be version 11.\n\nStep 6\n\nAll of the items that users can enter in the installer should be overridable on the command line for automated deployment as well. The full list of properties that\ncan be overridden will be available soon.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe new installer is under review by the members of the Platform SIG, but we need people to test the installer and give feedback. If you are interested in testing\nthe new installer, please join the Platform SIG gitter room for more information.\n\nThere are still some things that are being researched and implemented in the new installer (e.g., keeping port and other selections when doing an upgrade), but it is\ngetting close to release.\n\nIn addition to updates to the MSI based Windows installer, the Platform SIG is working on taking over the Chocolatey Jenkins package and\nreleasing a version for each update.","title":"Windows Installer Updates","tags":["windows","platform-sig","installers"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#988878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/19e71/slide_o_mix.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/77b35/slide_o_mix.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/d4a57/slide_o_mix.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/19e71/slide_o_mix.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/ef6ff/slide_o_mix.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/8257c/slide_o_mix.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/6766a/slide_o_mix.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"slide","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Alex comes from a .NET background but likes to get his hands dirty in many different languages and frameworks.
