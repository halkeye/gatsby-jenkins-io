Summer of Code is much more than a summer internship program, it is a year-round effort for the organization and some community members.\nNow, after the DevOps World | Jenkins World conference in Lisbon and final retrospective meetings, we can say that GSoC 2019 is officially over.\nWe would like to start by thanking all participants: students, mentors, subject matter experts and all other contributors who proposed project ideas, participated in student selection, in community bonding and in further discussions and reviews.\nGoogle Summer of Code is a major effort which would not be possible without the active participation of the Jenkins community.\n\nIn this blogpost we would like to share the results and our experience from the previous year.\n\nResults\n\nFive GSoC projects were successfully completed this year:\nRole Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements,\nPlugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library,\nWorking Hours Plugin - UI Improvements,\nRemoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features,\nMulti-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM.\nWe will talk about the projects a little later in the document.\n\nProject details\n\nWe held the final presentations as Jenkins Online Meetups in late August and Google published the results on Sept 3rd.\nThe final presentations can be found here:\nPart 1,\nPart 2,\nPart 3.\nWe also presented the\n2019 Jenkins GSoC report\nat the DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco\nand at the\nDevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Lisbon conferences.\n\nIn the following sections, we present a brief summary of each project, links to the coding phase 3 presentations, and to the final products.\n\nRole Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements\n\nRole Strategy Plugin is one of the most widely used authorization plugins for Jenkins,\nbut it has never been famous for performance due to architecture issues and regular expression checks for project roles.\nAbhyudaya Sharma was working on this project together with hist mentors:\nOleg Nenashev, Runze Xia and Supun Wanniarachchi.\nHe started the project from creating a new Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins based on JMH,\ncreated benchmarks and achieved a 3501% improvement on some real-world scenarios.\nThen he went further and created a new Folder-based Authorization Strategy Plugin which offers even better performance for Jenkins instances where permissions are scoped to folders.\nDuring his project Abhyudaya also fixed the Jenkins Configuration-as-Code support in Role Strategy and contributed several improvements and fixes to the JCasC Plugin itself.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins,\nIntroducing new Folder Authorization Plugin, Performance Improvements to Role Strategy Plugin\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nSource code: Role Strategy Plugin, Folder Authorization Plugin\n\nPlugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library\n\nNatasha Stopa was working on a new CLI tool for plugin management,\nwhich should unify features available in other tools like install-plugins.sh in Docker images.\nIt also introduced many new features like YAML configuration format support, listing of available updates and security fixes.\nThe newly created tool should eventually replace the previous ones.\nNatasha’s mentors: Kristin Whetstone, Jon Brohauge and Arnab Banerjee.\nAlso, many contributors from Platform SIG and JCasC plugin team joined the project as a key stakeholders and subject-matter experts.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: alpha release announcement,\ncoding phase 2 updates\n\nFinal evaluation: slides,\nvideo\n\nSource code: Plugin installation manager tool\n\nWorking Hours Plugin - UI Improvements\n\nJenkins UI and frontend framework are a common topic in the Jenkins project,\nespecially in recent months after the new UX SIG was established.\nJack Shen was working on exploring new ways to build Jenkins Web UI together with his mentor Jeff Pearce.\nJack updated the Working Hours Plugin to use UI controls provided by standard React libraries.\nThen he documented his experienced and created template for plugins with React-based UI.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: Updates on Working Hours Plugin UI,\nReact Plugin Template\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nSource code: Working Hours Plugin, Template for Jenkins plugins with React-based UI\n\nRemoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features\n\nLong Le Vu Nguyen was working on extended Kubernetes support in the Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin.\nHis mentors were Andrey Falco and Pham vu Tuan who was our GSoC 2018 student and the plugin creator.\nDuring this project Long has added a new agent launcher which provisions Jenkins agents in Kubernetes and connects them to the controller.\nHe also created a Cloud API implementation for it and a new Helm chart which can provision Jenkins as entire system in Kubernetes,\nwith Apache Kafka enabled by default.\nAll these features were released in Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog post for [Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nPlugin source code\n\nMulti-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM\n\nParichay Barpanda was working on the new GitLab Branch Source Plugin with Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs and Folder Organisation support.\nHis mentors were\nMarky Jackson-Taulia,\nJustin Harringa,\nZhao Xiaojie and\nJoseph Petersen.\nThe plugin scans the projects, importing the pipeline jobs it identifies based on the criteria provided.\nAfter a project is imported, Jenkins immediately runs the jobs based on the Jenkinsfile pipeline script and notifies the status to GitLab Pipeline Status.\nThis plugin also provides GitLab server configuration which can be configured in Configure System or via Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC).\nread more about this project in the GitLab Branch Source 1.0 announcement.\n\nProject page\n\nCoding phase 3 presentation\n\nGitlab Branch Source Plugin, Gitlab API plugin\n\nProjects which were not completed\n\nNot all projects have been completed this year.\nWe were also working on Artifact Promotion plugin for Jenkins Pipeline\nand on Cloud Features for External Workspace Manager Plugin,\nbut unfortunately both projects were stopped after coding phase 1.\nAnyway, we got a lot of experience and takeaways in these areas (see linked Jira tickets!.\nWe hope that these stories will be implemented by Jenkins contributors at some point.\nGoogle Summer of Code 2020 maybe?\n\nRunning the GSoC program at our organization level\n\nHere are some of the things our organization did before and during GSoC behind the scenes.\nTo prepare for the influx of students, we updated all our GSoC pages and wrote down all the knowledge we accumulated over the years of running the program.\nWe started preparing in October 2018, long before the official start of the program.\nThe main objective was to address the feedback we got during GSoC 2018 retrospectives.\n\nProject ideas.\nWe started gathering project ideas in the last months of 2018.\nWe prepared a list of project ideas in a Google doc, and we tracked ownership of each project in a table of that document.\nEach project idea was further elaborated in its own Google doc.\nWe find that when projects get complicated during the definition phase, perhaps they are really too complicated and should not be done.\n\nSince we wanted all the project ideas to be documented the same way, we created a template to guide the contributors.\nMost of the project idea documents were written by org admins or mentors, but occasionally a student proposed a genuine idea.\nWe also captured contact information in that document such as GitHub and Gitter handles, and a preliminary list of potential mentors for the project.\nWe embedded all the project documents on our website.\n\nMentor and student guidelines.\nWe updated the mentor information page with details on what we expect mentors to do during the program,\nincluding the number of hours that are expected from mentors,\nand we even have a section on preventing conflict of interest.\nWhen we recruit mentors, we point them to the mentor information page.\n\nWe also updated the student information page.\nWe find this is a huge time saver as every student contacting us has the same questions about joining and participating in the program.\nInstead of re-explaining the program each time, we send them a link to those pages.\n\nApplication phase.\nStudents started to reach out very early on as well, many weeks before GSoC officially started.\nThis was very motivating.\nSome students even started to work on project ideas before the official start of the program.\n\nProject selection. This year the org admin team had some very difficult decisions to make.\nWith lots of students, lots of projects and lots of mentors, we had to request the right number of slots and try to match the projects with the most chances of success.\nWe were trying to form mentor teams at the same time as we were requesting the number of slots, and it was hard to get responses from all mentors in time for the deadline.\nFinally we requested fewer slots than we could have filled.\nWhen we request slots, we submit two numbers: a minimum and a maximum. The GSoC guide states that:\n\nThe minimum is based on the projects that are so amazing they really want to see these projects occur over the summer,\n\nand the maximum number should be the number of solid and amazing projects they wish to mentor over the summer.\n\nWe were awarded minimum. So we had to make very hard decisions: we had to decide between \"amazing\" and \"solid\" proposals.\nFor some proposals, the very outstanding ones, it’s easy.\nBut for the others, it’s hard.\nWe know we cannot make the perfect decision, and by experience, we know that some students or some mentors will not be able to complete the program due to uncontrollable life events, even for the outstanding proposals.\nSo we have to make the best decision knowing that some of our choices won’t complete the program.\n\nCommunity Bonding.\nWe have found that the community bonding phase was crucial to the success of each project.\nUsually projects that don’t do well during community bonding have difficulties later on.\nIn order to get students involved in the community better, almost all projects were handled under the umbrella of Special Interest Groups so that there were more stakeholders and communications.\n\nCommunications.\nEvery year we have students who contact mentors via personal messages.\nStudents, if you are reading this, please do NOT send us personal messages about the projects, you will not receive any preferential treatment.\nObviously, in open source we want all discussions to be public, so students have to be reminded of that regularly.\nIn 2019 we are using Gitter chat for most communications, but from an admin point of view this is more fragmented than mailing lists.\nIt is also harder to search.\nChat rooms are very convenient because they are focused, but from an admin point of view, the lack of threads in Gitter makes it hard to get an overview.\nGitter threads were added recently (Nov 2019) but do not yet work well on Android and iOS.\nWe adopted Zoom Meetings towards the end of the program and we are finding it easier to work with than Google Hangouts.\n\nStatus tracking.\nAnother thing that was hard was to get an overview of how all the projects were doing once they were running.\nWe made extensive use of Google sheets to track lists of projects and participants during the program\nto rank projects and to track statuses of project phases (community bonding, coding, etc.).\nIt is a challenge to keep these sheets up to date, as each project involves several people and several links.\nWe have found it time consuming and a bit hard to keep these sheets up to date, accurate and complete, especially up until the start of the coding phase.\n\nPerhaps some kind of objective tracking tool would help.\nWe used Jenkins Jira for tracking projects, with each phase representing a separate sprint.\nIt helped a lot for successful projects.\nIn our organization, we try to get everyone to beat the deadlines by a couple of days, because we know that there might be events such as power outages,\nbad weather (happens even in Seattle!), or other uncontrolled interruptions, that might interfere with submitting project data.\nWe also know that when deadlines coincide with weekends, there is a risk that people may forget.\n\nRetrospective.\nAt the end of our project, we also held a retrospective and captured some ideas for the future.\nYou can find the notes here.\nWe already addressed the most important comments in our documentation and project ideas for the next year.\n\nRecognition\n\nLast year, we wanted to thank everyone who participated in the program by sending swag.\nThis year, we collected all the mailing addresses we could and sent to everyone we could the 15-year Jenkins special edition T-shirt, and some stickers.\nThis was a great feel good moment.\nI want to personally thank Alyssa Tong her help on setting aside the t-shirt and stickers.\n\nMentor summit\n\nEach year Google invites two or more mentors from each organization to the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit.\nAt this event, hundreds of open-source project maintainers and mentors meet together and have unconference sessions targeting GSoC, community management and various tools.\nThis year the summit was held in Munich,\nand we sent Marky Jackson and Oleg Nenashev as representatives there.\n\nApart from discussing projects and sharing chocolate, we also presented Jenkins there, conducted a lightning talk and hosted the unconference session about automation bots for GitHub.\nWe did not make a team photo there, so try to find Oleg and Marky on this photo:\n\nGSoC Team at DevOps World | Jenkins World\n\nWe traditionally use GSoC organization payments and travel grants to sponsor student trips to major Jenkins-related events.\nThis year four students traveled to the DevOps World | Jenkins World conferences in San-Francisco and Lisbon.\nStudents presented their projects at the community booth and at the contributor summits,\nand their presentations got a lot of traction in the community!\n\nThanks a lot to Google and CloudBees who made these trips possible.\nYou can find a travel report from Natasha Stopa here,\nmore travel reports are coming soon.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis year, five projects were successfully completed.\nWe find this to be normal and in line with what we hear from other participating organizations.\n\nTaking the time early to update our GSoC pages saved us a lot of time later because we did not have to repeat all the information every time someone contacted us.\nWe find that keeping track of all the mentors, the students, the projects, and the meta information is a necessary but time consuming task.\nWe wish we had a tool to help us do that.\nCoordinating meetings and reminding participants of what needs to be accomplished for deadlines is part of the cheerleading aspect of GSoC, we need to keep doing this.\n\nLastly, I want to thank again all participants, we could not do this without you.\nEach year we are impressed by the students who do great work and bring great contributions to the Jenkins community.\n\nGSoC 2020?\n\nYes, there will be Google Summer of Code 2020!\nWe plan to participate, and we are looking for project ideas, mentors and students.\nJenkins GSoC pages have been already updated towards the next year, and we invite everybody interested to join us next year!\n\nMain page with all contacts\n\nGSoC 2020 Project

The Mentor Summit is an unconference\nwhere participants are invited to fill empty time slots with their own topic of discussion.\n\nFriday Oct 12\n\nPre-conference meeting\n\nThe mentors had a short pre-conference meeting to reflect on the Jenkins participation in the 2018 GSoC program,\nand to plan for 2019.\nWe were joined at this meeting by Lloyd Chang, whom we had met at Jenkins World 2018.\nThank you Lloyd for joining us! A few ideas we had for 2019 are:\n\nMove project proposals to individual Google Documents\n\nCreate a template for project proposed by potential mentors and by project champions\n\nCreate an Organization Administrator Guide for future Jenkins GSoC project admins\n\nOther preparations we agreed to work on include a review of the 2018 feedback and the creation\nof an Epic capturing the action items in preparation for 2019.\nWe are also planning on making progress on the GSoC Budget process described in JEP-8.\n\nSummit Starts!\n\nThe summit started by a welcoming dinner at the Google Cafeteria and an evening session\nwhere we were explained how the unconference would work. We proposed a few topics:\ndealing with CPT lost slots, motivating mentors, and Open Source Hardware ASIC/FPGA.\n\nOn thing to say is that everyone at the conference had heard of Jenkins, or was already using Jenkins.\nLots of people came to tell us their Jenkins experience.\n\nI noticed this too - made me feel proud to be part of the Jenkins project.\n\n— Jeff Pearce\nJenkins GSoC mentor in 2018\n\nSaturday Oct 13\n\nThe morning started with a couple of announcements from Google.\nThe first one was that Google is thinking of creating a program called \"Google Season of Docs\" (GSoD for short),\nwhere technical writers would be paired with Open Source Organizations to help them write documentation such as:\n\nHigh-impact tutorials\n\nSet of How-To Guides\n\nContributor’s Guide\n\nDocumentation refactoring\n\nPlain documentation\n\nWe have additional details regarding this in the\nGSoC Mentor Summit Notes\nand we quickly concluded that if this program comes to life, Jenkins should be a participating organization.\n\nThe other announcement made by the GSoC administrators is that GSoC may take a different form in 2020.\nHowever, not much more information has been made available at this time.\nThe program has been operating for 13 years, and in 2020 it will have been 15 years.\n\nThe announcements were followed by a series of morning lightning talks.\nThis is where organizations showcase what their students accomplished during the program.\nThis is when we had a bit of a surprise…​\n\nOleg who had signed up for the evening lightning talks, was watching the talks while casually preparing slides for his evening presentation.\nBut something unusual happened: many talks were shorter than the 3-minute allotted, and suddenly we were ahead of schedule.\nThat’s when Oleg was called to the stage.\nI had no idea whether his slides were ready or not since he had just leaned over to me to say that he wanted to talk about all 3 projects we had this year.\nNot knowing how far he had gotten into refactoring the slides, this was going to be…​ interesting.\nBeing an experienced presenter, Oleg pulled it off brilliantly.\nThe slides were effectively ready (how he managed that I have no idea),\nbut you can see the slides of his lightning talk here:\nJenkins Remoting over Apache Kafka.\n\nThen there were the unconference sessions. Some of the sessions we attended are:\n\nDocumentation\n\nAttracting and retaining mentors (facilitated by Martin)\n\nOrganizing and motivating volunteers and mentors\n\nGetting students from coding/boot camps involved in open source\n\nRetaining students after GSoC\n\nOpen Event management System\n\nGSoC Feedback\n\nWe have notes for all the session in the main document.\nSome sessions were captured in separated documents which are linked from the main document, or from this blog post.\n\nThere were lots of good ideas in those sessions, and we will do what we can next year to implement some of them.\n\nSome organizations have said that the key for student retention\nis to give them responsibilities and tasks after the program is over.\nWe have certainly seen that this year, with one of our students asking for more responsibilities and wanting to know how\nhis plugin project could continue to grow within the Jenkins project (while at the same time help out on another GSoC plugin!).\n\nIn the evening was the second round of lightning talks.\nJeff Pearce presented the Code Coverage API Plugin lightning talk,\n(he was not caught by surprise).\n\nAfter the lightning talks, we were invited to hang out at the cafeteria and on the patio, to exchange stickers,\nnetwork with mentors of other organizations, and enjoy late evening snacks, music and of course the chocolate table!\n\nSunday Oct 14\n\nOn Sunday, the sessions continued. An interesting session was \"Beyond GSoC, What can Google do?\".\nOne person got a big round of applause when he said: \"Cloud credits\". It turns out the GSoC program admins\nhave been trying to get that for us for about 3 years. Google may be big and powerful, but some things\nare hard and remain hard in the corporate world.\n\nAn interesting suggestion was made by Oleg, and it would be to have a program with smaller, shorter term\ncommitments, something that would encourage more granular contributions but would not require a 4-month\nlong commitment. This was noted by the GSoC program admins.\n\nThen we attended a number of sessions:\n\nOpen Hardware ASIC/FPGA (facilitated by Martin)\n\nCommunity Metrics\n\nOutreachy (Jenkins is participating in this program)\n\nFailing a student\n\nBurnout (of mentors and org admins)\n\nThen the day came to an end with some last words by Google thanking all the mentors and volunteers who\nrun this program in their organizations.\n\nReturn trip\n\nI would now like to add a personal note. After the summit, like many others I fly back home,\nso I spend the evening at the SFO international terminal waiting for my late night flight.\nThat is where I get to meet more mentors, as some of us still wear our badges and T-Shirts,\nand also recognize each other from being at the conference.\nAnd funny enough, there are so many geeks at that terminal\nthat we may have recruited, among the passengers, a mentor to another org for next year!\n\nWant a GSoC student to work on your project in 2019?\n\nWe have already started the preparations for GSoC 2019.\nAnd we cannot do this without the participation of the Jenkins community.\nWe are already looking for:\n\nMentors from the Jenkins Special Interest Groups\n\nMentors from any background and any provenance (being a Jenkins developer is NOT required)\n\nProject proposals\n\nStudents and their proposals\n\nLots of people are afraid that mentoring a student will take a lot of their time.\nIf you feel that way, you are not alone. It does take some time. In my case, I spend 5 to 8 hours per week on mentor tasks (more at the start, less at the end).\nTo make it easier on mentors who likely have full time jobs and life commitments, we define different mentor roles:\n\nProject champion co-mentor : this is the mentor who proposes the idea, but may not have all the Jenkins code expertise needed. This mentor works with the student to define the project and acts mostly as a \"customer\" of the project. This mentor usually know enough about coding to comment on pull-requests with regards to the over quality, style and features of the code.\n\nTechnical co-mentor : this is the mentor who knows enough about the Jenkins code to guide the student on coding, and to provide Jenkins specific code reviews on pull-requests, but has limited involvement outside the coding activity of the student.\n\nThere is a third role which is:\n\nSubject Matter Expert : these individuals are not mentors, but we reach out to them 3-4 times during the project for advice and guidance, and sometimes complicated programming challenges.\n\nIf you have questions or are curious about the program,\ncontact us on the GSoC Gitter SIG chat.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that project proposals are not limited to \"big projects\".\nFor example, it is perfectly fine to have a proposal that is a collection of related Jira issues that aim to improve your project,\nor a list of tasks that need to be done for your project.\nWriting documentation is outside the scope of GSoC, but automating\ndocumentation generation, as long as it is mostly about writing code, is within the scope of GSoC.\n\nWe look forward working with the Jenkins community on GSoC 2019!","title":"Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit 2018","tags":["community","events","gsoc","gsoc2018"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#7898d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/7b80f/martinda.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/4c2a5/martinda.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/8bef2/martinda.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/7b80f/martinda.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/2864c/martinda.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/5abcf/martinda.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/410d2/martinda.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/6f814/martinda.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/ca864/martinda.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":136}}},"blog":null,"github":"martinda","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Martin is a Jenkins community member.
