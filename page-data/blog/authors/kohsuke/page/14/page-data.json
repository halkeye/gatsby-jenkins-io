Jenkins potential to make peoples lives easier is really amazing.\nYou guys are amazing.\nAnd Kohsuke, you’re my personal hero :-)\n\nAll right, that being said, let’s move on with the story.\n\nMost people who like FreedomSponsors probably don’t know that Jenkins is sort of the reason it exists in the first place. That’s right, if it wasn’t for Jenkins I’d probably never had the idea for FS.\n\nThis is how it happened.\n\nI was playing with the ( Jenkins OpenID plugin), and I was having some trouble with it.\nAfter a little research, I found that there was a JIRA bug for it - ( JENKINS-9216: Make OpenID work with Google Apps accounts).\n\n\"Bummer\" - I thought - \"Maybe I can try to debug it. Oh boy, but I don’t know anything about Jenkins code. That would be too…​ expensive! I bet there are a few people out there that would be willing to even pay a few bucks to the Jenkins crew to prioritize this.\"\n\nThe moment I thought that, a storm of ideas came rushing into my head.\nIt was like a conversation with myself in my mind.\n\n\"Wait a minute…​ why can’t people actually do just that?! They should be able to.\"\n\n\"Maybe a JIRA plugin could let them…​\"\n\n\"But what about other projects, ones that don’t use JIRA?\"\n\n\"Maybe there could be a central place for all those offers. If many people 'sponsor' the same issue, the developer who solve it might get a decent piece of gold - rightfully deserved. That could even free up more of their time to work on the projects they love :-)\"\n\n\"The sponsors would pay the developers out of gratitude, and for the sake of keeping their word.\"\n\n\"This has the Agile spirit in it: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\"\n\nAnd I kept thinking, and it didn’t took very long until I had the whole \"sponsoring model\" in my head.\nI realised that that was one of the best ideas I had in my life. I was very excited and I had to act on it.\n\nI started studying Django on that same day. I had already learned some Python before and Django had been on my queue for some time. And I’m glad I did it. I’ve been building JavaEE (Java web) applications for about 8 years now, and, oh boy, Django makes things soooo much easier, and simpler, and faster to code - I’m in love with it…​ Okay, but I’m missing the point here.\n\nSo, I started building \"it\" alone on my free time. It took me a few days to pick a name for \"it\".\nThe \"FreedomSponsors\" name came very naturally - it rightfully conveys what the platform would do, and the spirit of software freedom that I’d like to encourage.\n\nSeven weeks later it was done. I had already bought the domain and created an account at Amazon AWS.\nSo I put it up and started bugging everyone about it.\nAnd guess who was the first person I wanted to tell? Kohsuke Kawaguchi :-)\nIt was just fair. So I sent him this email.\n\nOn Sun, Jul 8, 2012 at 3:36 AM, Tony França tonylampada@gmail.com wrote:\n\nHi Kohsuke.\nMy name is Tony, I’m a Software Architect.\nI’m a big fan and a (very) heavy user of Hudson - Jenkins.\nIt has really been enabling our company to move towards a \"continuous delivery\"-like development process in the past couple of years.\n\nSo, thank you for that.\n\nAlso, if it wasn’t for Jenkins, maybe I would never had the idea to build the FreedomSponsors web site.\nThat’s my personal project - an idea that I had about six weeks ago.\n\nYou see, most of the time I was developing it, I had you in mind.\nI have always felt that \"Jenkins is so great, that Kohsuke really deserves to get rich for it\".\n\nI just launched FreedomSponsors - a few minutes ago.\nIt just felt right to come here and tell you about it :-)\n\nLet’s see if I can get you rich now :-).\n\nCheers!\nTony Lâmpada\n\nAnd his reply just made my day\n\nOn Thu, Jul 12, 2012 at 5:19 PM, Kohsuke Kawaguchi wrote:\n\nCongratulations for launching your service.\n\nI thought about a similar idea long time ago over a lunch with my colleagues, but my hats off to you for actually making it real. I can imagine a lot of obstacles (most of those you already note in FAQ), but if this works out I think it’d be great.\n\nBy the way, I wonder if you have considered open-sourcing this, say under Aflo GPL. With the network effect and being the dominant contributor, it’s very difficult for anyone else to run the same code on public internet to compete with you, and it does let other people contribute small changes, and given your audience is open-source developers, I think it sends the right message as well as help you boost your development. It also seeds the ecosystem (of Bugzilla plugin, JIRA plugin, dashboard, etc.), too.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n\nYou see, FS’s code was still closed when I launched it. I was worried about competition indeed.\nBut his arguments were very convincing. Specially when he talked about sending the right message to the Free Software community. I thought about it for while and came to the conclusion that he has absolutely right. It still took me a few weeks until I moved the code to Github. I’m glad I did it. The feedback loop has been great.\n\nAnd that was not his only contribution. He also gave us this very useful piece of feeback:\n( JIRA plugin to link from tickets to FreedomSponsors)\n\nIndeed, that was a great idea. My friend and associate Arthur is the one who built it.\nKohsuke suggested that I joined the Jenkins crew at the ( Jenkins Governance meeting) to see if everyone would agree about installing it on Jenkins JIRA. Everyone liked the idea and had no ojections.\n\nI can’t say enough how trilled and honored I felt knowing that Jenkins would be the first project to install our plugin. Thank you folks. Thanks Kohsuke. You guys are awesome :-)\n\nNow FreedomSponsors is growing, slowly but steadily. And what makes us really happy is that almost every developer we tell about it just loves the idea. We’ve received valuable, constructive feedback from a lot of people who want to see us moving forward. That’s the best incentive that I could wish for.\n\nWe still have a lot of challenges ahead of us. The biggest and closest one in the horizon is to start a \"movement\" that will help spread within companies a culture of contributing more to the free software projects they depend on, by making they realise that that’s what’s best for everyone. If we can achieve that then we’ll have made the free software world even better.\n\nSo, everything I wrote so far is, hopefully, only the begginning of this story. And I’m really excited and looking forward to see it unfold. Being a part of it is even more exciting.\n\nWhat about you? If you want to be updated about, or even help write the next chapters, then\njoin, follow, like, read, spread the word, give feedback and contribute with code or new issues.\n\nThank you Jenkins crew, thank you Kohsuke.\nWe wouldn’t have made it here without you.","title":"Sponsor Jenkins bugs with Freedom Sponsors","tags":["development"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","id":"324acdda-6221-5180-94c4-b937a9779d92","slug":"/blog/2012/09/28/saturday-night-drink-up/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/NCI_Visuals_Food_Beer.jpg/320px-NCI_Visuals_Food_Beer.jpg[image] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nBecause https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/84235932/[the dinner looks popular], here's another last minute gathering for https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb[JUC San Francisco]. +\n +\n\n+\nWe'll have a small drink-up Saturday night at http://21st-amendment.com/[21st Amendment] (563 2nd Street), like from 6pm to whenever.

It lets us discuss how to solve the problem, instead of spending time discussing what the problem is. +\n +\n\n+\nLast year, we've heard loud and clear that people wanted to see some UI improvements.

This year, there are whopping 6 sessions that discuss Jenkins (including myself, which is the very first session in Monday!) Unfortunately some of them happen in the same time, but I for one am looking forward to seeing the mobile app test talk from Intuit.\n\nCON6256 - Large-Scale Automation with Jenkins (Monday 8:30am, Hilton)\n\nJenkins is the most adopted open source continuous integration server today, and beyond the automated build and test, it is a platform for launching all kinds of automation tasks. As the use of Jenkins grows inside an organization, people are automating complex activities that need to be choreographed—such as deploying an application, running a load test, cleaning up the environment, and then handing over the build to the operation team. Such orchestration of activities is a very useful building block for continuous delivery, a practice promoted in recent years. This session looks at various patterns and plug-ins that deal with this kind of choreography. It also briefly discusses what’s new in recent versions of Jenkins.\n\nCON3648 - Take Your Mobile Applications Tests to the Next Level: Continuous Integration (Monday 1pm, Hilton)\n\nMobile tests today can be automated by popular mobile testing frameworks in Java such as monkeyrunner, Sikuli, and Robotium. However, getting mobile tests running in continuous integration is not widely understood and rarely implemented. Whether you are an experienced mobile developer or tester or new to the mobile field, this session informs you about the complexities of emulators and devices and how you can navigate through each challenge to integrate mobile tests into Jenkins. You will be guided step-by-step through two case studies on how to integrate native Android and iPhone application tests by using monkeyrunner and Sikuli, respectively, into Jenkins. Leave with Java code samples of these automated tests as well as practical knowledge of mobile devices and emulators.\n\nCON2822 - Real-World Strategies for Continuous Delivery with Maven and Jenkins (Tuesday 10am, Hilton)\n\nMaven is close to ubiquitous in the world of enterprise Java, and the Maven dependency ecosystem is the de facto industry standard. However, the traditional Maven build and release strategy, based on snapshot versions and carefully planned releases, is difficult to reconcile with modern continuous delivery practices, where any commit that passes a series of quality-control gateways can qualify as a release. How can teams using the standard Maven release process still leverage the benefits of continuous delivery? This presentation discusses strategies that can be used to implement continuous delivery solutions with Maven and demonstrates one such strategy using Maven, Jenkins, and Git.\n\nCON12570 - Pragmatic Continuous Delivery (Tuesday 10am, Hilton)\n\nWhen you send a package via FedEx, it goes through a tracked, automated process that makes sure the package arrives promptly at the destination. Continuous delivery describes how this process can similarly be made fully automated and transparent, with your commits “fedexed” to production. The focus of continuous delivery is the delivery pipeline. Every commit that enters the pipeline should go through automated integration and testing, and if successful, produce a release candidate. This presentation is based on a demo that uses Jenkins to orchestrate the delivery pipeline; Nexus for long-running and manual workflows; and LiveRebel to make production updates quick, automated, nondisruptive, and reversible.\n\nCON3363 - HTML5 Testing in All Browsers with Java (Tuesday 11:30am, Parc 55)\n\nWould you love to test your HTML5 app in all browsers? The biggest challenge in writing HTML5 applications is that your application must run on many platforms, ranging from old desktop browsers to cutting-edge mobile browsers. Each browser behaves nearly the same, but inconsistencies can lead to major bugs. In this session, JavaOne Rockstar and Java Champion Kevin Nilson shows how you can leverage open source Java tools to test your HTML5 application in all browsers. The presentation shows examples of using tools such as TestSwarm, QUnit, jQuery, Jenkins/Hudson, Oracle VM VirtualBox, GlassFish Server technology, and Sun SPOTs to test your HTML5 application in all browsers.\n\nCON12983 - Java PaaS: The Engine for Delivering Enterprise and Mobile Applications (Wednesday 8:30am, Parc 55)\n\nAttend this demo-filled session that shows you how to use Java platform as a service (PaaS) to deploy complete enterprise applications in the cloud with Eclipse, Jenkins, and MySQL in addition to iOS/Android clients and full end-to-end continuous integration. In a few minutes, you’ll have cloud-based Git/SVN repositories set up with CI builds triggered automatically and your apps, databases, and supporting services up and running live. The presentation also shows how you can add more PaaS services—ALM, Web monitoring and analytics, hosted log management, e-mail integration, enterprise search, cloud DB services, and much more—to your apps right off the bat. Experience the future of Java development!\n\n+\n +\nAnd it looks like the jclouds session will also touch jgroups plugin: +\n +\n\nCON8009 - What’s New in jclouds 1.5 (Monday 10am, Parc 55)\n\njclouds 1.5 is the result of 3.5 years of development by nearly 100 developers interested in portable cloud computing. During this session, you’ll get up-to-date with cloud computing technology developments such as OpenStack. You’ll learn how to use jclouds 1.5 to control private and public infrastructures and storage clouds programmatically. You’ll also see examples of new tools powered by jclouds, including Jenkins and Brooklyn.","title":"Jenkins sessions at JavaOne","tags":["general","javaone"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a9d59619-964b-56f6-8905-740dfe1e1ee6","slug":"/blog/2012/09/24/jenkins-project-meeting-in-the-meat-space-call-for-agenda/","strippedHtml":"As you may or may not know, the Jenkins project has a bi-weekly IRC meeting where we discuss and decide on things necessary to keep the project running.\n\nNext Sunday, we’ll bring this project meeting live to Jenkins User Conference San Francisco.\n\nSince this is an unique opportunity to engage people who don’t normally come to these meetings, I’d like to encourage everyone to propose agenda items and add it to the agenda page.\n\nThe Wiki page lists all the past meetings, so you can get a sense of what it is like.
