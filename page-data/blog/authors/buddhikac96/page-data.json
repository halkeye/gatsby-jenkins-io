GSoC 2020 Phase 3 has ended now and it was a great period for the Jenkins Windows Services - YAML Configuration Support project.\nIn this blog post, I will announce the updates during the GSoC 2020 - Phase 2 and Phase 3. If you are not already aware of this project,\nI would recommend reading this blog post which was published after GSoC 2020 - Phase 1.\n\nProject Scope\n\nWindows Service Wrapper - YAML configuration support\n\nYAML schema validation\n\nNew CLI\n\nXML Schema validation\n\nYAML Configuration Support\n\nUnder WinSW - YAML configurations support, these tasks will be done.\n\nYAML to Object mapping\n\nAt the moment YAML object mapping is finished and merged.\nYou can find all the implementations in this Pull Request.\n\nExtend WinSW to support both XML and YAML\n\nThis task is already done and merged. Find the implementation in this Pull Request.\n\nYAML Configuration support for Extensions\n\nAt the moment there are 2 internal plugins in WinSW. RunAwayProcessKiller and SharedDirectoryMapper.\nWe allow users to provide configurations for those plugins in the same XML and YAML configuration file which is used to configure WinSW. This task is merged as well.\nPull Request\n\nYAML schema validation\n\nUsers can validate YAML configuration file against JSON schema file.\nUsers can use YAML utility tool from Visual Studio market place to validate YAML config file against JSON schema.\n\nKey updates in Phase 2 and Phase 3\n\nYAML Configuration structure\n\nEnvironment variables\n\nNow users can provide environment variables as a sequence of dictionaries that contains name and value for environment variables.\n\nTimeStamp values\n\nUsers can specify timestamp values in the same manner used in XML (e.g. 10 ms, 5 sec, 3 min)\n\nYAML configuration document was published.

I am participating in GSoC 2020 with Jenkins.\nI am working on the Windows Service Wrapper Project.\nSo the Coding Phase 01 of GSoC 2020 is now over and this blog post describes what I have done so far.\n\nWindows Service Wrapper is an executable, which we can use to run applications as Windows Services on Windows machines, which has almost one million downloads.\nIn Jenkins, we use Windows service wrapper to run Jenkins server and agents as Windows services to gain more robustness.\nThis feature is bundled into Jenkins’s core. Currently, the Windows Service wrapper is configured by an XML file.\nHowever, there is a limited number of configuration checks and there is no XML schema.\n\nXML is not such a human-friendly way to do that. It is quite verbose and not easy to identify the schema without some effort.\nUsually, users misconfigure the service wrapper. This is a sample XML configuration file that we can use to provide configurations to Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nSample XML Configuration File\n\njenkins\nJenkins\nThis service runs Jenkins automation server.\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_201\\bin\\java.exe\n-Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle\n    -jar \"C:\\Program Files\\Jenkins\\jenkins.war\" --httpPort=8081 --webroot=\"%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinswar\"\nrotate\n\n%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinsjenkins.pid\n10000\nfalse\n\nThe usage of YAML could simplify configuration management in Jenkins, especially when automated and configuration management tools are used.\nSo what we are doing under GSoC - 2020 is to update the Windows Service Wrapper to support YAML configurations.\nAfter finishing this project, users will be able to provide configurations to the Windows Service Wrapper as a YAML file.\n\nThis is a sample YAML configuration file for Windows Service Wrapper and you can see it is less verbose than XML or JSON and much more human friendly.\nUsers can read and edit this without a big effort.\n\nSample YAML Configuration File\n\nid: jenkins\nname: Jenkins\ndescription: This service runs Jenkins automation server.\nenv:\n    _name: JENKINS_HOME\n    _value: '%LocalAppData%\\Jenkins.jenkins'\nexecutable: 'C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_201\\bin\\java.exe'\narguments: >-\n    -Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle\n    -jar \"C:\\Program Files\\Jenkins\\jenkins.war\" --httpPort=8081 --webroot=\"%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinswar\"\nlogmode: rotate\nonfailure:\n    _action: restart\nextensions:\n    -\n        pidfile: '%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinsjenkins.pid'\n        stopTimeout: '10000'\n        stopParentFirst: 'false'\n        _enabled: 'true'\n        _className: winsw.Plugins.RunawayProcessKiller.RunawayProcessKillerExtension\n        _id: killOnStartup\n\nAdvantages of YAML as a configuration file\n\nIt is less verbose and much more human friendly than XML.\n\nSince YAML is not using extra delimiters, it is lightweight.\n\nNowadays YAML has become more popular among configuration management tools.\n\nProject Scope\n\nDuring this project, I will add the following features to Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nYAML Configuration support\n\nYAML Schema validation\n\nNew CLI for the Windows Service Wrapper\n\nSupport for XML Schema validation via XML Schema Definition (XSD)\n\nPhase 01 Updates\n\nIn GSoC - 2020 phase 01, I have done the following updates to the Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nProject Structure overview document. (Published)\n\nYAML configurations support (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nNew CLI (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nXML Schema validation (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nYou can find Phase 01 Demo slides in this link.\n\nBelow you can find more details about the deliverables listed above.\n\nProject Structure overview\n\nThe project structure overview document describes how files and directories are organized in the Windows Service Wrapper project.\nIt will help contributors as well as users, to understand the codebase easily.\nAlso, it helps me a lot to understand the codebase. You can find the document from the given link.\n\nYAML configurations support\n\nAs I explained before, in this project, configurations will be provided as a YAML file.\nI used YamlDotNet library which has more than 2.2k stars on GitHub, to deserialize the YAML file into an Object graph.\nIn this YAML file, users can specify configurations in a more structured way than in XML configuration files.\nAs an example, now users can specify all the log related configurations under the log config.\nUsers can specify all service account related configurations under serviceaccount config etc.\n\nAt the moment, I am working on a design document for YAML configuration support. I will add it to the GitHub Issue once ready\n\nNew CLI\n\nBefore moving into Phase 01 updates, it’s better to explain why we needed a new CLI for Windows Service Wrapper.\nIn the early phases of Windows Service Wrapper, we will keep the XML configuration support as well.\nSo we should allow users to specify the configurations file separately.\nThe current approach is, configurations file should be in the same directory, where Windows Service Wrapper executable exists and the file name of the XML file should be the same as the Windows Service Wrapper executable file name.\nAlso, users should be able to redirect logs if they need to and they should be allowed to elevate command prompt using Windows Service Wrapper.\nAlso, we thought that it’s better to allow users to skip schema validation if they needed. So we decided to move into a new CLI.\n\nAs I explained, after releasing this, users will have options in addition to commands.\nIt will make the WinSW CLI more flexible so that we can easily extend it later. These are the options users are allowed to use.\nThese options are available with all the commands except help and version\n\n--redirect / -r [string]\n\nUsers can specify the redirect path for the logs if needed\n\nNot required | Default value is null\n\n--elevated / -e [boolean]\n\nElevate the command prompt before executing the command\n\nNot required | Default value is false\n\n--configFile / -c [string]\n\nUsers can specify the configurations file as a path\n\nNot Required | Default value is null\n\n--skipConfigValidation / -s [boolean]\n\nUsers can skip schema validation for configurations file if needed\n\nNot required | Default value is true\n\n--help / -h\n\nUser can find what options are available with a particular command with this option\n\nThis option is available with the install command\n\n--profile / -f [boolean]\n\nIf this option is true, then users can provide a service account for installation explicitly.\n\nNot required | Default value is false\n\nWe used commandlineparser/commandline library to parse the command line argument which has more than 2k stars in GitHub. At a glance, the library is compatible with .NET Framework 4.0+, Mono 2.1+ Profile, .NET Standard, and .NET Core.\n\nXML Schema validation\n\nAs I mentioned before, there was no schema validation for XML in Windows Service Wrapper.\nHence, I was working on schema validation for XML. I use XSD to validate XML files. The XSD file will be shipped as an embedded resource with the executable.\nYou can find the XSD file in my pull request.\n\nFuture updates\n\nIn the next phase, for GSoC 2020 the listed deliverables features will be released and the YAML schema validation feature will be added.\nAlso, we hope to publish a design document for the new features, which will help contributors.\n\nHow to contribute\n\nYou can find the GitHub repository in this link. Issues and Pull requests are always welcome.\nAlso, you can communicate with us in the WinSW Gitter channel, which is a great way to get in touch and there are project sync up meetings every Tuesday at 13:30 UTC on the Gitter channel.\n\nSome useful links\n\nProject Page\n\nProject Repository\n\nGitter Channel\n\nYamlDotNet library\n\nCommand Line Parser library","title":"Windows Service Wrapper : YAML Configuration Support - GSoC Phase - 01 Updates","tags":["winsw","windows","jenkins","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"buddhikac96","html":"","id":"buddhikac96","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Buddhika Chathuranga","slug":"/blog/authors/buddhikac96","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"buddhikac96","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
