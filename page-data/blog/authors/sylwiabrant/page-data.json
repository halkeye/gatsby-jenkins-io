Don’t hesitate - engage in the community.\nJoin us in our work of creating the functionalities you see beneficial.\nYou are welcome to create issues and pull requests. We are actively resolving community issues and providing answers on a dedicated Slack channel.\n\nAs the project has been initially developed and still actively maintained by VirtusLab, we started discussion towards an open governance model to facilitate communication and collaboration.\n\nLead the way we are heading by providing us feedback\n\nTo celebrate the new possibilities that are being opened for our project, we would like to invite you to take part in a short survey that will help put us on the right track.\nIf you have been using Jenkins Operator or running Jenkins in any other environment, please take a moment to fill out our quick survey.\nWe will choose at least three of the most informative answers and send you an awesome Jenkins Operator T-shirt with our cute Gopher butler.\nThe survey can be found here. Remember, the most sincere answers are the best.\n\nAnd if you still haven’t used Jenkins Kubernetes Operator, you’re more than welcome to do so.\nGive it a shot and discover a new kind of simplicity of running Jenkins.\n\nHow to get started.","title":"Jenkins Operator becomes an official sub-project!","tags":["kubernetes","operator","contributing","announcement"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"antoniaklja","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Engineering Manager in a cloud-native world managing mid-sized cross-functional team and responsible for cloud-related initiatives at VirtusLab.</p>\n</div>","id":"antoniaklja","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Bartek Antoniak","slug":"/blog/authors/antoniaklja/","twitter":"antoniaklja"},{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"SylwiaBrant","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Software Engineer at VirtusLab, working in area of cloud-native technologies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Maintainer of Jenkins Kubernetes Operator.</p>\n</div>","id":"sylwiabrant","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sylwia Brant","slug":"/blog/authors/sylwiabrant/","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"sylwiabrant","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
