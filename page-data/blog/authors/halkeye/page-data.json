It was an experiment to let\nplugins be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main\nJava Virtual Machine runtime with help of JRuby.\nA similar extension was made to allow plugins to be written in Python but still integrated into the Java Virtual Machine with Jython.\n\nOver the years though, the experiments are no longer being maintained and the\nplugins that use the non-Java runtimes take a lot of compatibility effort.\nIn addition, the Jenkins ruby runtime does not support Java 11.\nSpecifically, the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins\ncore developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and\nprocesses to keep the non-Java runtimes barely working.\nExamples of the experienced issues include compatibility with jep:200[Switch Remoting/XStream blocklist to a permitlist] where we had to allow many Ruby Runtime classes in the Jenkins core to support serialization of data.\n\nIn 2018 we discussed the future of the Ruby Runtime based plugins.\nThere was a consensus that we want to deprecate and remove the plugins so that Jenkins users do not experience issues .\nDaniel Beck created jep:7[Deprecation of ruby-runtime] for that.\nOver the years, the functionality provided by Ruby plugins has been largely replaced by other implementations,\nand hence we have decided to proceed with the deprecation\n( discussion).\n\nOne month from now, January 22nd, 2022, the default Jenkins update center will stop distributing\nthe Ruby runtime plugin, the plugins that use the Ruby runtime, the Python runtime plugin, and the plugin that uses the Python runtime.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nIf you are one of the few users who are using the following plugins, there will be no impact on your existing instances. The\nonly change will come for new installs. Suspended plugins will stay\ninstalled, but can not be newly installed without manually downloading\nreleases or using custom update centers.\n\nJenkins plugin management tools and distributions may be affected as well if they use the default update center to download the plugins and/or their metadata.\nIt includes but is not limited to the official Docker images,\nHelm charts,\nJenkinsfile Runner,\nCustom Jenkins WAR Packager,\nand the Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool.\nNote that all these tools allow custom update sites to be configured if required.\n\nThe lists below provide additional information about the plugins based on the Ruby Runtime and the Python Runtime.\nPlease plan your transition away from these plugins.\nThey will be removed from the official Jenkins update centers on January 22, 2022.\n\nAffected plugins\n\nGitlab Hook\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nContains multiple security vulnerabilties.\nSuggestion: Use the GitLab plugin and the GitLab Branch Source plugin.\n\nCucumber\n\nLast released 9 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run cucumber from the command line.\n\npyenv\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run pyenv from the command line.\n\nRvm\n\nLast released 5 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run rvm from the command line.\n\nCapitomcat\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Install Ruby and

conditionally execute Pipeline steps.\n\nGit notes\n\nLast released 10 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh, bat, or other scripts to run git to annotate commits.\n\nrbenv\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run rbenv from the command line.\n\nChef\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run chef from the command line.\n\nCI Skip\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the GitHub Commit Skip SCM Behaviour, Bitbucket Commit Skip SCM Behaviour, or SCM Skip to skip builds based on the content of commit messages.\nAlternately, use sh, bat, or other scripts to read git commit messages and conditionally execute Pipeline steps.\n\nInstallShield\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh, bat, or other scripts to run InstallShield.\n\nMySQL Job Databases\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use Jenkins Job Database Manager Plugin for MySQL.\n\nPathignore\n\nLast released 10 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the path ignore features of various plugins or use sh, bat, or other scripts to read git commit messages and conditionally execute Pipeline steps.\n\nPerl\n\nLast released 9 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run perl from the command line.\n\npry\n\nLast released 10 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the Jenkins groovy console and its interface from the Jenkins command line interface.\n\nSingle Use Agent\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use cloud agents ( Fargate, Azure Container Instances, Docker, etc.) to allocate agents for a single use and then release them.\n\nTravis YML\n\nLast released 5 years ago.\nSuggestion: Rewrite the travis.yml file as a Jenkinsfile, a Jenkins Templating Engine file, a Pipeline as YAML, or a Jenkins Modular Pipeline Library.\n\nYammer\n\nLast released

ago.\n\nPerl Smoke Test\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\n\nbuddycloud\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank all contributors and maintainers who contributed to the Ruby Runtime based plugins and the Python Runtime based plugin.\nWe also thank those who participated in development of new plugins replacing the functionality.\nThese contributors helped millions of Jenkins users while the ecosystem was supported over the past 10 years\nand it is not taken for granted.\nNow we need to move on so that we can keep expanding the Jenkins architecture and developers tools.\nWe invite all contributors to participate in this effort and to help us to migrate the plugins to supported JVM-based platforms for plugins.\n\nMy instance is affected, what to do next?\n\nIf you do not use the affected plugins, the recommendation is to remove them.\nOtherwise, it is recommended to start migration out of the plugins to alternatives providing similar functionality.\n\nNot all plugins have alternatives.\nAt the moment the Jenkins core team does not plan to provide a replacement, but any contributions are welcome.\nIf you depend on the functionality,\nwe recommend reaching out to the community in the developer mailing list so that\nyou can coordinate the replacement with other affected users.","title":"Deprecating non-Java

Infrastructure Officer (uncontested)\n\nWadeck Follonier was elected as the Security Officer (uncontested)\n\nMark Waite was re-elected  in the role of Documentation Officer for another term\n\nThe board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being,\nand we are excited to see contributors taking these roles.\n\nThe board continues to require that no single company may have a majority on the Jenkins governance board.\nOleg Nenashev is employed by Dynatrace, while Mark is employed by CloudBees.\n\nGovernance Board election details\n\nThis year we had three candidates participating in Jenkins Governance Board elections:\nMark Waite,  Oleg Nenashev (returning), and Ullrich Hafner (returning)\nAll of them are awesome community leaders who actively contribute to the Jenkins project and represent its users.\nIt would be an honor to have them on the Jenkins board.\nRegardless of the election results, we appreciate their participation and the time they invested in these elections.\n\nThis year we were electing 2 governance board members.\nWe were using the Condorcet Internet Voting Service that allows voters to rank their choices rather than just picking their one favorite choice.\nYou can find full voting results here :\n\nMark Waite (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nOleg Nenashev loses to Mark Waite by 37–22\n\nUllrich Hafner loses to Mark Waite by 42–14, loses to Oleg Nenashev by 37–15\n\nCongratulations to the returning Oleg, and the newly elected Mark, and thanks to Ullrich for his past contributions.\nAll new board members are elected for a 2-year term unless they decide to step down earlier.\nThe estimated end of the term for them is December 02, 2023.\n\nOfficer election details\n\nAll 5 officer positions were up for election this year.\nThese roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2022.\nAfter the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,\n4 officer positions were uncontested:\n\nTim Jacomb - Release Officer\n\nAlyssa Tong - Events Officer\n\nDamien Duportal - Infrastructure Officer\n\nWadeck Follonier - Security Officer\n\nDocumentation Officer election results\n\nMark Waite won the biggest support as a Documentation officer ( voting results).\nMark will continue as Documentation Officer.\n\nMark Waite (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nSaeid Bostandoust loses to Mark Waite by 46–9\n\nThanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!\nOfficers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.\nIt requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.\n\nStatistics\n\nThis year we had 81 registered voters and around 59 actual votes.\n\nFeedback\n\nThe Jenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe appreciate and welcome feedback regarding the election process so that we can improve the process.\nWe have started a Retrospective document for these elections.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\n\nIf you have any private feedback you would like to share,\nplease send an email to the Jenkins Board.\nIf you would like to raise any issues about the election process,\nplease contact one of the elected Governance Board members.","title":"2021 Jenkins Board and Officer Elections
