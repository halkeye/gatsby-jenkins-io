Of particular interest to users of Hudson’s various native packages for Red Hat, openSuSE, Ubuntu/Debian and Solaris, was a change that suppress the \"self-upgrade\" functionality in the \"Manage Hudson\" page. On the enhancements side of the fence, the team added authentication support to the Hudson CLI ( issue 3796) allowing Hudson users with locked down installations to take advantage of everything the CLI has to offer.\n\nInternal to Hudson, some more changes from Alan Harder (a.k.a mindless, a.k.a The Garbage Man), deprecating or otherwise removing deprecated APIs. Alan’s been doing some great work on Hudson’s internals, if you’re coming out to this weekend’s hackathon, but sure to pat him on the back for his tireless efforts.\n\nBug fixes\n\nFix handling of relative paths in alternate settings.xml path for Maven projects. ( issue 4693)\n\nAlternate settings, private repository, profiles, etc were not used in embedded Maven for deploy publisher. ( issue 4939)\n\nMake editableComboBox work in repeatable content, such as a build step.\n\nIf content is captured using ..content.. , fixed this to use proper HTML rendering when appropriate.\n\n'<' and '&' in the console output was not escaped since 1.349 ( issue 5852)\n\nFixed an AbstractMethodError in SCM polling under some circumstances. ( issue 5756)\n\nFixed a ClassCastException in the Subversion plugin - now using Subversion plugin 1.13. ( issue 5827)\n\nThe Maven Integration plugin link in the Update Center was going to a dead location. ( issue 4811)\n\nOn RPM/DEB/etc installation, don’t offer the self upgrade. It should be done by the native package manager. ( report)\n\nFixed a possible lock up of agents.\n\nEnhancements\n\nAdded advanced option to LogRotator to allow for removing artifacts from old builds without removing the logs, history, etc. ( issue 834)\n\nAuthentication support in Hudson CLI.

Depending on supplies, I may send you a little more than requested to be shared.\n\nCompanies\n\nIf your company wants some Hudson stickers, I’d be happy to oblige, and of course I always appreciate stickers, pens, branded bouncy balls, etc (see: swag) in return!\n\nPeople who like stickers\n\nIf you’re just a fan of Hudson, stickers, or both, I’ll still gladly mail you a few stickers with the condition that you take pictures of where the stickers end up (and maybe of your Hudson install) and either email me some cool pictures or post them to Flickr (tagged: \" hudsonstickers\")\n\nI will be stuffing envelopes in my free time, so there may be a slight delay. You can email me at tyler at linux dot com requesting stickers, I’ll need:\n\nHow many: (estimate)\nWhat for: (conference|usergroup|company|iwantsomeokay)\nMailing Address:","title":"Want some Hudson stickers?","tags":["core","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

When I sat down to write the inaugural post, Welcome to Continuous Blog, I set forth a few goals:\n\nHelp advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community\n\nBe a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson users of all skill-levels\n\nRecognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their efforts\n\nBeing a community resource, I wanted to review our progress on those goals along with some other interesting details about Continuous Blog and my community efforts. My metrics for achieving these goals are largely based on web traffic to this blog and retweets via the @hudsonci twitter account. First a minor overview of some of Continuous Blog’s traffic, then I’ll get to reviewing the goals.\n\nVisitor trend via Google Analytics\n\nOver the past month Continuous Blog has seen just under 10,000 visits from a number of different sources, the top sources being:\n\nFeedburner links posted to @hudsonci\n\nDirect visits\n\nFeedburner\n\nReferrals from the \"blog\" link on hudson-ci.org\n\nreddit\n\nLinks from the Java.net community portal and associated weblogs\n\nIn addition to general web traffic, Continuous Blog has around 350 RSS subscribers.\n\nTo put these numbers into perspective, Hudson has seen commits from 173 different developers and the @hudsonci twitter account has about 1,100 followers.\n\nHudson Advocacy\n\nLooking at the traffic sources and the volume of traffic coming from what I would consider \"the wider internet community\" I’d say I failed to meet my own expectations. The majority of traffic seems to be coming from \"within the community\", which is certainly not a bad thing by a stretch, but I was hoping to start to see more visitors who are less likely to be using Hudson already. There are signs of this (I think) in the low number of search referrals, roughly 370 visits. To me this indicates the early age of this site, small number of external links to Continuous Blog and the content isn’t \"interesting\" enough to come up in searches for terms like \"continuous integration with python\".\n\nThe vector for improvement in advocacy, in my opinion, is to focus more on tutorials and user guides in the next month. Mike Rooney’s post on Keeping your configuration and data in Subversion was both discussion provoking, but one of the more visited pages over the past month. I’ll be reaching out to more power-users from differing backgrounds to try to get some more tutorials on using Hudson for Python, Ruby, and Cocoa development while continuing to bug some of you Maven2 pros about guides.\n\nCentral information repository\n\nI feel I failed to meet my own expectations here as well, it has only been a month (feels like an eternity!) so the amount of information we’ve been able to aggregate is small, but growing.\n\nI have likely spent too much time covering Hudson community news, which I feel is important, to put a human voice in front of commits and releases, but it is not what I originally intended to spend the majority of my time doing.\n\nRecognition of contributors\n\nIn my opinion, this goal I’ve met. When writing up each Hudson release I’ve made certain to give credit where credit is due, to those that contributed, Through the \"spotlight\" series of posts I’ve also made an effort to highlight power-users of Hudson, trying to glean interesting details about their installations from them for our benefit. Unfortunately I’ve done a poor job highlighting the contributions from individual plugin developers, something I’m still not certain how to correct.\n\nContent\n\nIf you’ve been following the blog you have no doubt noticed the regular occurrence of certain types of posts, these regular series are:\n\n\"This Week in Plugins\"\n\nThis post is halfway script generated, pulling all the release details out of SVN history to help me generate a post. The intention of the post being to cite new or notable plugins, while giving an informative listing of \"what’s happening\" in plugin development for the past week.\n\n\"Spotlight On\"\n\nThe only interview-formatted series I’ve got going right now, I’ve been trying to find companies or organizations who are using Hudson in interesting ways and are willing to let \"us\" peek behind the curtains a bit. This started more from curiosity, but I think it’s fun to let Hudson users brag about their set ups.\n\nHudson 1.xxx Released\n\nPretty straight-forward reporting on a release of Hudson, depending on the contents of the release there may be some calls to action or editorializing on what’s gone into the release.\n\nLinks for\n\nRoll-up of links shared or retweeted via the @hudsonci account, uncertain whether this is worth the time spent.\n\nMy two questions to the community in general would be:\n\nDo you dislike any of these?\n\nWhat else would you like to see on a regular basis?\n\nI’m certainly open to suggestion, I’d like Continuous Blog to continue to be interesting to the Hudson community and if certain kinds of posts are boring or uninteresting, I can cut them from the line-up.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe largest challenge of Continuous Blog is time. As it stands the majority of content I write or edit in some capacity, which is a larger amount of time than I expected to spend. All said and done it takes me between 6-10 hours a week to write for CB, keep tabs on @hudsonci and peruse the mailing list for interesting things. This probably isn’t maintainable, and if for some reason a bus hits me ( not uncommon around here), this blog would go dark for a while.\n\nThis can be easily fixed by simply adding more contributors to the blog, I’ll post more on how to write for Continuous Blog in another post.\n\nAll said and done, I am looking forward to another month of writing and following the Hudson community. I’m grateful for all those who’ve asked questions, been interviewed, wrote content and participated in discussion in the comments. For those of you in the Bay Area, I do hope you come out for the meet-up in mid-March, for the rest of you, I’ll catch you on IRC :)","title":"One month of Continuous Blog","tags":["core"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
