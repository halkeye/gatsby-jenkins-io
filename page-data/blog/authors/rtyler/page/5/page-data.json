Since many of us are already planning, the Monday following the event turned out to be the ideal time to discuss 2.0.\n\nIf you’re not already familiar with some of the key proposals that were put forth, you can review them in the Jenkins 2.0 proposals summery page.\n\nWe’ve hosted one or two Contributor Summits in the past, and they’re usually a day-long event where we try to gather a number of Jenkins core/plugin developers and active/power users to have detailed discussions around the theme of the summit. For this \"Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit\" we do not have a complete agenda yet, but we will post that to the Meetup event once it is fully prepared in the next couple weeks.\n\nSuffice it to say, we’ll be discussing a lot!\n\nVenue and RSVP\n\nThe Contributor Summit will be hosted in a CloudBees office at: Rue des Colonies, 11, Brussels, Belgium. If you’re already planning on attending FOSDEM, the office is near Grand Place and Cafe Delerium (where the Friday beer event is hosted).\n\nThe venue is of limited size, so if you’re planning to join us, please RSVP to the Meetup event as soon as you’re certain you will be able to attend.

Please note that some of the details of the program are different from the linked grant program page\n\nRegardless we hope to see you all at FOSDEM on January 30th and 31st, 2016, in Brussels!\n\nEligibility\n\nAll community members are eligible for support unless they’ve received a travel grant within the last year (based on the event’s date). However, as we have very limited funds to support this program, we’ll prefer applications by active contributors to the Jenkins project.\n\nIf you have other possible funding sources, please look to them first. This will allow more people to attend a Jenkins community event.\n\nApplication\n\nThe application process for FOSDEM, due to our poor timing, deviates from the traditional Travel Grant Program.\n\nTo apply for a travel grant, send an email with the following information to the Governance Board at jenkinsci-board@googlegroups.com before January 6th.\n\nYour name\n\nThe event you’d like to attend\n\nThe expected cost of travel (airfare, hotel, conference fees, etc.)\n\nA description of your contributions to the Jenkins project, such as:\n\nPlugins you developed\n\nPull requests you authored\n\nDocumentation you wrote\n\nPublic presentations on Jenkins-related topics\n\nWhy should we sponsor your trip?\n\nApplicants Responsibilities\n\nIf you’ve been selected for a travel grant, we’ll expect you to:\n\nBe available for a blog post about this program before the event.\n\nHelp out at the Jenkins stand at FOSDEM\n\nIf your schedule permits, we’d love to see you at the Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit the day after FOSDEM.\n\nIt should go without saying that we expect all Jenkins contributors representing the project at an event such as FOSDEM to act in a respectful and constructive manner. As we have not yet formally adopted our own Code of Conduct, we recommend reviewing the FOSDEM Code of Conduct.\n\nAfter the trip, please submit a travel report to jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list. This report should include the following:\n\nWhat you accomplished at the event\n\nWhat you learned at the event\n\nContacts you made\n\nOther useful information\n\nWe also expect you to submit your receipts via email to the person mentioned in the travel grant confirmation for review.

Kishore works for CloudBees, building custom frameworks with Open Source software and helping customers solve engineering problems around continuous delivery and DevOps at scale.\n\nThis year some great new Jenkins features came out of the butler’s goodie bag - amongst them, the most important one being the ability to realize continuous delivery pipeline as code!\nThe features like Workflow Multibranch, pipeline-as-code (with a marker file that Jenkins looks for in your application’s SCM repository/branch, aptly named Jenkinsfile) are the foundations to making Jenkins super intelligent to automagically create workflows (rather, a CI/CD pipeline) to build your code and orchestrate the work required to drive your application from concept to delivery!\n\nOverview\n\nThe Workflow Multibranch feature (provided by the workflow plugin) provides the following key abilities:\n\nAutomatic Workflow (job) creation in Jenkins per new branch in the repo (assuming webhooks are registered from GH to Jenkins).\n\nBuild specific to that child-branch and its unique scm change and build history.\n\nAutomatic job pruning/deletion for branches deleted from the repository, according to the settings.\n\nFlexibility to individually configure branch properties, by overriding the parent properties, if required.\n\nJenkins pipeline-as-code (concept) enables you to maintain your CI/CD workflow logic in the project/application source code repo with no additional configuration to be maintained per branch in Jenkins.\n\nThe Workflow script to build/test/deploy your code is always synchronized with the rest of the source code you are working on.\n\nTo demonstrate the concept here - Let’s use a basic Java Web application project with a Maven pom.xml as shown in the structure below (this is using GitHub as the SCM but you can do this on SVN or Mercurial too).\n\nThis project has a marker file for Jenkins in the repo - Jenkinsfile. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic1.png\n\nSo, what’s a Jenkinsfile? The Jenkinsfile is essentially your Jenkins Workflow, a script, that defines the CI/CD pipeline logic for a project with steps to build/test/deploy etc. captured in various stages.\n\nSo for our sample Java web application, a basic Jenkinsfile could be something like -\n\nnode {\n   // Mark the code checkout 'stage'....\n   stage 'Checkout'\n\n   // Checkout code from repository\n   checkout scm\n\n   // Get the maven tool.\n   // ** NOTE: This 'M3' maven tool must be configured\n   // **       in the global configuration.\n   def mvnHome = tool 'M3'\n\n   // Mark the code build 'stage'....\n   stage 'Build'\n   // Run the maven build\n   sh \"${mvnHome}/bin/mvn clean install\"\n}\n\nJust having this file in the source code repo root would mean that -\n\nJenkins will automatically recognize this branch and create appropriate jobs by itself.\n\nQuick, 1-step code checkout using: “checkout scm” in your workflow\n\nEvery time a new change is pushed to this branch, the branch is built and the commit status gets updated.\n\nWhen the branch is destroyed in the repository, or if Jenkinsfile is removed, the corresponding job gets destroyed from Jenkins automatically ( You can retain these jobs and/or archive the builds for audit/compliance requirements using the retention property - Orphan Item strategy)\n\nthere are various mechanisms to promote reuse of Workflow scripts, such as the Workflow Global Library.\n\nRequired Jenkins configuration\n\nMake sure you’ve the latest Workflow and (v1.11 as of writing this blog) Workflow Multibranch plugins installed on your Jenkins instance image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic2.png\n\nAlso, ensure that other dependencies, like SCM plugins and build tools, are met:\n\nEither SVN/Git/Mercurial (depending on your SCM)\n\nGitHub Branch Source Plugin (optimized to use the GitHub API and improve performance)\n\nMaven build tool\n\nFinally, make sure you’ve created the required Webhook from your SCM (Github in this case) to Jenkins.\nHere’s how to do that:\n\nSetting up GitHub Webhooks in Jenkins\n\nStep-by-step guide to setting up Jenkins for GitHub projects\n\nThen create a new Multibranch Workflow Job with configuration as shown below - mainly selecting the Branch Sources (Git, in this example) and providing the branch/repo URL with credentials.\n\nBranch sources (Git) - https://github.com/kishorebhatia/pipeline-as-code-demo (or a repo where you’ve cloned this source code with Jenkinsfile)\n\nLeave all other properties default and Save. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic3.png\n\nYou’ll observe that Jenkins would perform Branch Indexing on that “cd” job folder and start the workflow for the master branch, with an automatically created new job, named master, under the “cd” folder.\n\nThe workflow does a dummy step for application deploys to the environments in this sequence Staging -> Waits for manual approval -> PROD\n\nNow, let’s create a new branch off of this master branch in your cloned git repo:\n\n$ git branch newBranch (create a newBranch)\n\n$ git checkout newBranch (switches to newBranch)\n\n$ git push --set-upstream origin newBranch (pushes newBranch)\n\nYou’ll observe that your Jenkins instance automatically picks up this newBranch and starts running the workflow (with the Jenkinsfile in this newBranch) to build/test/deploy the code. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic4.png\n\nNext, if you now delete this newBranch ( git branch -D newBranch), Jenkins will automatically remove the orphan Workflow job for newBranch. You can retain these jobs even after the branches are deleted using the Orphaned Item Strategy property in the main \"cd\" job’s configuration.\n\nSo we observed the following benefits of this pipeline-as-code approach:\n\nOverall job definition is a script (Jenkinsfile)\n\nCalls your build tools and scripts for details\n\nThe build script can be versioned alongside project sources\n\nJenkins handles feature/experimental branches automatically\n\nKeep less configuration in $JENKINS_HOME\n\nDockerized Demo environment\n\nYou can also use the following docker image to run this demo with a preconfigured Jenkins environment and the sample job: jenkinsci/workflow-demo (i.e. docker pull jenkinsci/workflow-demo)\n\nThis docker container includes Jenkins with Workflow and Workflow Multibranch plugins, a local git repo with the aforementioned Java web application and Jetty to demonstrate a continuous delivery pipeline of this application deployed and tested across multiple environments in the pipeline with an approval gate before promoting to PROD (like QA, Staging and PROD).\n\nThere’s a \"cd\" job pre-configured as a multibranch Workflow job.\n\nLaunch the docker demo as: docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 9418:9418 -ti jenkinsci/workflow-demo\n\nNow, you can access Jenkins on port 8080 and Jetty on port 8081 from localhost or the IP of your boot2docker/docker-machine environment.\n\nThe demo container has a local git repo so you can clone: git://localhost/repo. When creating new branches, each branch automatically creates a matching subproject in Jenkins and triggers the build for that branch. The workflow:\n\nChecks out source code from the same repository and commit as Jenkinsfile.\n\nBuilds sources via Maven with unit testing.\n\nRuns two parallel integration tests that involve deploying the app to ephemeral server instances, which get thrown away when tests are done (this is done by using auto-deployment of Jetty)\n\nOnce integration tests are successful, the webapp gets to the staging server at localhost:8081/staging (or your docker-machine/boot2docker instance IP)\n\nrequires a human to Manually inspect the staging instance, and when ready, approves the deployment to the production server at http://localhost:8081/production/\n\nReferences\n\nDeveloper blog by jglick introducing multibranch support\n\nworkflow plugin tutorial\n\nworkflow plugin presentations\n\nworkflow plugin demo readme","title":"Pipeline-as-code with Multibranch Workflows in Jenkins","tags":["general","guest post","tutorial","pipeline","workflow"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Thus Hacksgiving 2015 was created!\n\nWe’ll be hosting Hacksgiving Nov 23rd and Nov 24 from 7:00PST - 15:00PST (10:00EST - 18:00EST) and would love for you to join! ( RSVP here)\n\nYou don’t need to know Java to help! We will have documentation and design hacking going on as well.\n\nWe have a few goals for Hacksgiving:\n\nIntroduce new contributors to the process of writing code and/or documentation ( documentation hacking details here).\n\nFind some plugins which are up for adoption new maintainers.\n\nClean up or merge some existing plugins which need some care ( listed here).\n\n=== Sessions to note\n\nHere are some of the sessions scheduled that will be hosted by members of community that may interest you:\n\nDay One\n\n7:00PST/10:00EST ( 15-30min) - rtyler will host a welcome and introduction to contribution to the Jenkins project (walking through our contributors guide)\n\n10:00PST/13:00EST ( 60min) - schristou will host a workshop titled \"Introduction to plugin development for Jenkins\"\n\nDay Two\n\n10:00PST/13:00EST ( 60min) - abayer will be hosting a \"Plugin Developer Open Q&A\" session, so bring your questions!\n\nHacksgiving is very unconference structured right now, so if you’re interested in hosting a session please let us know in the #jenkins-community channel or by signing up for a session on the schedule\n\nHow to participate\n\nSince this is a virtual hackathon, we’ll be congregating and chatting in a couple of ways:\n\nOn the #jenkins IRC channel as per usual\n\nWe’ll be hosting sessions and tutorials via Google Hangouts, see the \" hacker hangout * section on the wiki page up to date details\n\nVia the #hacksgiving hashtag on Twitter\n\nYou can also RSVP on our meetup page!\n\nWe hope you can join in the festivities!","title":"Celebrating Hacksgiving!","tags":["general","cia","just for fun"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

See the security advisory for more information about these releases.\n\nUpdated 2015-11-06 03:55 UTC: Included a updated mitigation script which doesn’t have a Jenkins boot race condition\n\nEarlier today we received numerous reports about a previously undisclosed \" zero day\" critical remote code execution vulnerability and exploit in Jenkins core. Unfortunately the vulnerability was not disclosed to us ahead of its publication so we’re still working on more thorough fix. In the meantime however, we wanted to inform you of the issue and provide a workaround which will help prevent this exploit from being used against public Jenkins installations, for future reference this issue is being tracked privately as SECURITY-218 in our issue tracker.\n\nThe attack is mounted through the Jenkins CLI subsystem, so the work-around is to remove/disable the CLI support inside of the running Jenkins server.\n\nUsing the following Groovy script you can disable the attack vector in your Jenkins installations by navigating to “Manage Jenkins” and then to “Script Console”, or just go to https://your-jenkins-installation/script. This only addresses the current running Jenkins process, in order to make the workaround persist between restarts of the Jenkins server, add the script below to $JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy (create the directory if necessary, and the file).\n\nimport jenkins.*;\nimport jenkins.model.*;\nimport hudson.model.*;\n\n// disabled CLI access over TCP listener (separate port)\ndef p = AgentProtocol.all()\np.each { x ->\n  if (x.name.contains(\"CLI\")) p.remove(x)\n}\n\n// disable CLI access over /cli URL\ndef removal = { lst ->\n  lst.each { x -> if (x.getClass().name.contains(\"CLIAction\")) lst.remove(x) }\n}\ndef j = Jenkins.instance;\nremoval(j.getExtensionList(RootAction.class))\nremoval(j.actions)\n\nin order to make the workaround persist between restarts of the Jenkins server, add the script below to $JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy (create the directory if necessary, and the file).\n\nThe latest version of this script can be found in this GitHub repository.\n\nAs previously announced on the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list we’re preparing a security release for this upcoming Wednesday which will include patches for both the latest and LTS lines of Jenkins core. The Jenkins Security team is working to include a fix for this previously undisclosed exploit in or before this planned security release.\n\nIf you have questions about this exploit, join us in the #jenkins channel on Freenode or ask on the jenkinsci-users@ mailing list.\n\nFor security researchers and hobbyists, if you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Jenkins, we have some disclosure guidelines on this wiki page which will help us mitigate any discovered issues as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list ( jenkinsci-advisories), it’s the fastest way to get updates by the Jenkins Security team.","title":"Mitigating unauthenticated remote code execution 0-day in Jenkins CLI","tags":["general","core","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

The introduction of Java 8 last year brought performance improvements and highly desirable API changes, which make developing Java-based applications (arguably) much easier than before. The release was followed earlier this year by the end-of-life announcement for Java 7; the writing is on the wall: upgrade to Java 8.\n\nI wanted to answer the question \"does it even make sense to force an upgrade to Java 8?\" There are plenty of technical discussions that we can have in the community on whether or not this is the right approach, but my goal was to try and measure the current Jenkins install base for Java 8 preparedness.\n\nWhile we do not currently (to my knowledge) collect Java runtime versions in our anonymous usage statistics, we do have access logs from our mirror redirector which might provide some insight.\n\nWith some access logs data, I went through the millions of requests made to Jenkins infrastructure in 2015 and started filtering out the user agent which made those requests.\n\nNOTE: This data is totally not scientific and is only meant to provide a coarse insight into what versions of Java access Jenkins web infrastructure.\n\nWhen Jenkins hits the mirror network, it’s not overriding the default user agent from the Java runtime, so many of the user agents for the HTTP request are something like Java/1.7.0_75. This indicates that the request came from a Java Runtime version 1.7.0 (update 75).\n\nLooking at the major JVM versions making (non-unique) requests to Jenkins infrastructure we have:\n\n1.8.0 : 21,278,960\n\n1.7.0 : 27,340,214\n\n1.6.0 : 4,148,833\n\nThis breaks down across various updates as well, which is also particularly interesting to me because many of these Java versions have long since had security advisories posted against them. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/jvm-versions-with-updates.png\n\nAs I mentioned before, this is not a rigorous analysis of the access log data and is also not filtered by unique IP addresses. What I found most interesting though is that the Java 8 upgrade numbers are actually fairly strong, which I didn’t expect. I expect that piece of the pie will continue to grow. Hopefully so much so that we’re able to move over to Java 8 before the end of 2016!","title":"What JVM versions are running Jenkins?","tags":["general","just for fun"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

We started with some more internally facing changes and have slowly progressed from the \"inside-out\" to today’s topic: improving the out of the box user experience. That is to say, the experience that a brand-new Jenkins user has when getting started with the server.\n\nJust to recap, so far we’ve reviewed:\n\nIntroducing a policy for API deprecation\n\nSplitting Groovy out of 'core'\n\nPipeline as code front and center\n\nUser experience improvements (part one)\n\nThe subject of today’s proposal is captured in JENKINS-31157 , which, like yesterday’s proposal, contains a few issues linked from it with more details.\n\nAt a high level, the problem aiming to be solved is:\n\nWhen a new user installs Jenkins, they are greeted with the main, empty, dashboard which suggests that they \"create jobs.\" This makes no mention of plugins or the configuration options that are relevant to helping the user make Jenkins match their needs.\n\nIn past and current versions of Jenkins, if you know what you’re looking for it’s relatively easy to move around the interface. If you’ve never used Jenkins before, it can be very challenging to find your way around or even know what it is possible to do with Jenkins.\n\nThe proposed changes aim to address this initial confusion:\n\nInstead of changing the post-install defaults, which may not properly represent the user’s needs, the first-time user experience should help guide the user through configuration and plugin installation quickly so they can use Jenkins for their needs. Effectively it should be as easy as possible for a user to arrive at a good configuration for their usage.\n\nJenkins contributor Tom Fennelly, who has led this discussion on the mailing lists in the past, has posted a good prototype screencast of what some of this might entail:\n\nProviding Feedback\n\nWe’re asking you to read the issues linked from JENKINS-31157 and comment and vote on those issues accordingly.\n\nIf you have ever logged in to the issue\ntracker or the\nwiki, you have a \"Jenkins user account\" which\nmeans you’ll be able to log into the issue tracker and vote for, or comment on\nthe issue linked above.\n\n( note : if you have forgotten your password, use the account\napp to reset it.)\n\nWe’re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either\napprove or reject the proposal two weeks from today.\n\nThis concludes this week’s blog series highlighting some of the Jenkins 2.0 proposals we felt were important to discuss with the broader Jenkins user audience. Many of these, and other minor proposals, can be found on the Jenkins 2.0 wiki page.","title":"Jenkins 2.0 Proposal: Improved \"Out of the box\" user experience","tags":["general","core","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
