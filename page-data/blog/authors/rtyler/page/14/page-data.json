What puts Hudson in a league of its own compared to others is its ability to execute arbitrary commands on agent machines, or in the case of the EC2 plugin, execute arbitrary commands \"in the cloud.\" In light of all this, Hudson is quite secure and offers a variety of mechanisms to reduce the potential for exploits.\n\nDespite Hudson’s security track record, you’ve managed to find a vulnerability in Hudson, and decide to don your white hat and inform the Hudson team. First off, let me commend you on your brilliant decision to report the vulnerability, you are truly a leader among men.\n\nGenerally immediate public disclosure of vulnerabilities is frowned upon as it doesn’t give us much time to react, investigate and patch the hole. For this reason there is the \" SECURITY\" project in Hudson’s JIRA. The SECURITY project is a more locked down section of JIRA than the other projects and allows you to submit issues and have them reviewed by the Hudson core developers who can assess the vulnerability. When reporting the issue, it will be helpful to include information regarding the environment the Hudson instance is running in (such as the servlet container) as well as any pertinent reproduction steps so the team can reproduce, fix and verify with as little wheel-spinning as possible.\n\nWhat happens next wholly determines on the severity of the issue, if it’s a highly critical vulnerability, the team will likely make an out-of-schedule release and advise users to upgrade. If it’s a less critical hole, the fix will be included in an upcoming scheduled release. Either way, the Hudson team has a good track record of correct potential security holes in a timely fashion.\n\nAfter the hole you’ve discovered has been patched and released, you can revel in the fact that you helped make Hudson better, thanks!\n\nImage courtesy of ThinkGeek","title":"So you've found a vulnerability, now what?","tags":["general","core","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Along with the usual bunch of fixes, this release includes a number of localization updates courtesy of a team of Hudson community volunteers participating in the Hudson Internationalization project.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this post is being published on Tuesday, contrary to the schedule that I operated on with Continuous Blog, I will no longer be posting release updates on Monday morning. Traditionally Hudson is released Friday afternoon (PST), meaning any potential regressions are reported early on Monday morning after our European users start to upgrade. Publishing this release announcement on Tuesday gives me more time to test out the release so I can report with greater confidence in the reliability of the update. ( Note : This may change in the future as we push for easier RC testing capabilities within Hudson)\n\nIf you’re a regular reader of the Hudson Labs blog, you may also notice that this change log looks eerily similar to the 1.362 announcement from last week. Turns out I had mistakenly taken the upcoming changes from 1.363 and reported them as fixes in 1.362; I’ve since updated the post regarding 1.362’s change log.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nFix queue handling to close locking gap between removing job from queue and starting build, to prevent unintended concurrent builds (refactor of change first made in 1.360). ( report)\n\nAllow multiple dependencies between same two projects, as they may trigger under different conditions and with different parameters.

It’s been a long time since I’ve written for the Hudson community, but now I’m back and ready to tackle some of the latest developments in the Hudson community.\n\nWhat is Hudson Labs?\n\nAs you may have read in April, Kohsuke left Oracle to found InfraDNA, a company specializing around Hudson. The departure meant the Hudson community would no longer have access to some of the hardware and services that Kohsuke had accumulated over the years working on Hudson at Sun Microsystems. While we are still happily part of the Java.net community, we’ve recognized the need for some community-owned resources and Hudson Labs was born.\n\nOver the past couple months, a group within the Hudson community, \"infra\" (short for \"infrastructure\"), has been working to get machines set up and build the foundation for a more open Hudson project infrastructure.\n\nWhat does Hudson Labs provide?\nBuilds\n\nOne of the first tasks we set upon when building out Hudson Labs was to start improving the build and release process of Hudson by moving as much of it into a public Hudson instance. Building Hudson itself, plugins and dependencies of the Hudson project, the Hudson Labs instance will help improve the reliability of the Hudson ecosystem across the board, and should serve as a useful tool for core and plugin developers.\n\nMirroring\n\nThanks to the great team over at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab ( OSUOSL), we’ve been able to build out mirroring infrastructure for Hudson to provide fast access to native packages and wars alike. Currently the OSUOSL only has mirrors inside the continental United States, so we’re reaching out to friends in Asia and Europe to extend the mirroring system.\n\nInformation\n\nI’m currently working on re-working some of the blog posts you may have read over four months as more structured tutorials. I hope to provide an easily accessible knowledge-base for developing Hudson along with configuring Hudson for various platforms and development environments; this is a more difficult task so all the pieces aren’t entirely in place for this just yet.\n\nTo be honest, I’m very enthusiastic about Hudson’s future. Now that InfraDNA is up and running, Kohsuke’s renewed focus combined with the foundation of Hudson Labs and the uncommonly hospitable Hudson developer and user communities, the future is looking bright!","title":"Welcome to Hudson Labs!","tags":["general","meta","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
