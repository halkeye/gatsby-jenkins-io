this week the Jenkins infrastructure team identified a successful attack against our deprecated Confluence service.\nWe responded immediately by taking the affected server offline while we investigated the potential impact.\nAt this time we have no reason to believe that any Jenkins releases, plugins, or source code have been affected.\n\nThus far in our investigation, we have learned that the Confluence CVE-2021-26084 exploit was used to install what we believe was a Monero miner in the container running the service.\nFrom there an attacker would not be able to access much of our other infrastructure.\nConfluence did integrate with our integrated identity system which also powers Jira, Artifactory, and numerous other services.\n\nThe trust and security in Jenkins core and plugin releases is our highest priority.\nWe do not have any indication that developer credentials were exfiltrated during the attack.\nAt the moment we cannot assert otherwise and are therefore assuming the worst.\nWe are taking actions to prevent releases at this time until we re-establish a chain of trust with our developer community.\nWe have reset passwords for all accounts in our integrated identity system.\nWe are improving the password reset system as part of this effort.\n\nAt this time, the Jenkins infrastructure team has permanently disabled the Confluence service, rotated privileged credentials, and taken proactive measures to further reduce the scope of access across our infrastructure.\nWe are working closely with our colleagues at the Linux Foundation and the Continuous Delivery Foundation to ensure that infrastructure which is not directly managed by the Jenkins project is also scrutinized.\n\nIn October 2019 we made the Confluence server read-only effectively deprecating it for day-to-day use within the project.\nAt that time, we began migrating documentation and changelogs from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\nThat migration has been ongoing, with hundreds of plugins and many other documentation pages moved from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\n\nWe are grateful for those of you who followed our responsible disclosure procedure and reached out to us about this vulnerability affecting the Jenkins project.\n\nWe will continue to take proactive measures to improve the security of our infrastructure and encourage you to follow us on Twitter for further updates.","title":"Jenkins project Confluence instance

At this year’s DevOps World - Jenkins World in San Francisco, I will\nbe sharing more details on the philosophy behind Jenkins Evergreen, show off\nhow far we have come, and discuss where we’re going with this radical\ndistribution of Jenkins.\n\nAs discussed in my first blog post, and\nJEP-300,\nthe first two pillars of Jenkins Evergreen have been the primary focus of our\nefforts.\n\nAutomatically Updated Distribution\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, implementing the mechanisms necessary for safely and\nautomatically updating a Jenkins distribution, which includes core and plugins,\nwas and continues to be a sizable amount of work. In\nBaptiste’s talk\nhe will be speaking about the details which make Evergreen \"go\" whereas\nI will be speaking about why an automatically updating distribution is\nimportant.\n\nAs continuous integration and continuous delivery have become more commonplace,\nand fundamental to modern software engineering, Jenkins tends to live two\ndifferent lifestyles depending on the organization. In some organizations,\nJenkins is managed and deployed methodically with automation tools like Chef,\nPuppet, etc. In many other organizations however, Jenkins is treated much more\nlike an appliance, not unlike the office wireless router. Installed and so\nlong as it continues to do its job, people won’t think about it too much.\n\nJenkins Evergreen’s distribution makes the \"Jenkins as an Appliance\" model much\nbetter for everybody by ensuring the latest feature updates, bug and security\nfixes are always installed in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, I believe Evergreen will serve another group we don’t adequately\nserve at the moment: those who want Jenkins to behave much more like a\nservice. We typically don’t consider \"versions\" of GitHub.com, we receive\nincremental updates to the site and realize the benefits of GitHub’s on-going\ndevelopment without ever thinking about an \"upgrade.\"\n\nI believe Jenkins Evergreen can, and will provide that same experience.\n\nAutomatic Sane Defaults\n\nThe really powerful thing about Jenkins as a platform is the broad variety of\npatterns and practices different organizations may adopt. For newer users, or\nusers with common use-cases, that significant amount of flexibility can result\nin a paradox of choice. With Jenkins Evergreen, much of the most common\nconfiguration is automatically configured out of the box.\n\nIncluded is Jenkins Pipeline and Blue Ocean, by default. We also removed some\nlegacy functionalities from Jenkins while we were at it.\n\nWe are also utilizing some of the fantastic\nConfiguration as Code\nwork, which recently had its 1.0 release, to automatically set sane defaults in\nJenkins Evergreen.\n\nStatus Quo\n\nThe effort has made significant strides thus far this year, and we’re really\nexcited for people to start trying out Jenkins Evergreen. As of today,\nJenkins Evergreen\nis ready for early adopters. We do not yet recommend using Jenkins\nEvergreen for a production environment.\n\nIf you’re at DevOps World - Jenkins World in San Francisco please come see\nBaptiste’s talk Wednesday at 3:45pm in Golden Gate Ballroom A. Or\nmy talk at 11:15am in Golden Gate Ballroom B.\n\nIf you can’t join us here in San Francisco, we hope to hear your feedback and thoughts in our\nGitter channel!","title":"Continuously delivering an easy-to-use Jenkins with Evergreen","tags":["jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2018","evergreen"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

The immutable nature of releases\nand the immutable nature of tags can definitely go hand in hand, but up until\nfew months ago Jenkins Pipeline was not able to trigger effectively off of Git\ntags.\n\nIn this post I want to briefly share how to use tags to drive behaviors in\nJenkins Pipeline. Consider the following contrived Jenkinsfile, which\ncontains the three basic stages of Build, Test, and Deploy:\n\npipeline {\n    agent any\n    stages {\n        stage('Build') {\n            steps {\n                sh 'make package'\n            }\n        }\n        stage('Test') {\n            steps {\n                sh 'make check'\n            }\n        }\n        stage('Deploy') {\n            when { tag \"release-*\" }\n            steps {\n                echo 'Deploying only because this commit is tagged...'\n                sh 'make deploy'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nOf particular note is the\nwhen\ncondition on the \"Deploy\" stage which is applying the tag criteria. This\nmeans the stage would only execute when the Pipeline has been triggered from a\ntag in Git matching the release-* Ant-style wildcard.\n\nIn practice, this means that all pull requests, and branch-based Pipeline Runs\nresult in the stage being skipped:\n\nWhen I push a release-1.0 tag, the Pipeline will then be triggerd and run the\n\"Deploy\" stage:\n\nOut of the box, Pipelines won’t trigger off of the presence of tags, which\nmeans that a Multibranch Pipeline must have a configuration update to know that\nit must Discover Tags.\n\nConfiguring\n\nFrom the configuration screen of a Multibranch Pipeline (or GitHub Organization\nFolder), Discovering tags can be enabled by adding the appropriate \"Behavior\"\nto the Branch Source configuration:\n\nWith these changes, the Jenkinsfile in the tagged versions of my source\nrepository can now drive distinct deployment behavior which is not otherwise\nenabled in the Pipeline.","title":"When using tags in Jenkins Pipeline","tags":["pipeline","git"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Personally, the most\nexciting challenge of this project is defining the machinery to drive\nautomatic updates\nof Jenkins Essentials, which viewed from a high level, are classic continuous\ndelivery challenges.\n\nIn this post, I wanted to dive into a bit of the gritty details of how we’re\ngoing to be delivering Jenkins Essentials with automatic updates, which has\nsome really interesting requirements for the development of Jenkins itself.\n\nThe traditional Jenkins core and plugin development workflow involves a\ndeveloper working on changes for some amount of time, then when they’re ready,\nthey \"create a release\" which typically involves publishing artifacts to our\nArtifactory, and then on a timer (typically every 15 minutes) the Update Center will\nre-generate a file called update-center.json. Once the new Update Center has\nbeen generated, it is published and consumed by Jenkins installations within\n24 hours. Of course, only after Jenkins administrators recognize that there is\nan update available, can they install it. All in all, it can take quite a long\ntime from when a developer publishes a release, to when it is successfully used\nby an end-user.\n\nWith our desire to make Jenkins Essentials updates seamless and automatic, the\nstatus quo clearly was not going to work. Our shift in thinking has required a\ncouple simultaneous efforts to make this more continuously delivered approach\nviable.\n\nDeveloper Improvements\n\nStarting from the developer’s workflow,\nJesse Glick\nhas been working on publishing \"incremental builds\" of artifacts into a\nspecial Maven repository\nin Artifactory. Much of his work is described in the very thorough\nJenkins Enhancement Proposal 305.\nThis support, which is now live on\nci.jenkins.io\nallows plugin developers to publish versioned changes from pull requests and\nbranches to the incrementals repository. Not only does this make it much\neasier for Jenkins Essentials to deliver changes closer to the HEAD of\nmaster branches, it also unlocks lots of flexibility for Jenkins developers\nwho coordinate changes across matrices of plugins and core, as occasionally is\nnecessary for Jenkins Pipeline, Credentials, Blue Ocean, and a number of other\nfoundational components of a modern Jenkins install.\n\nIn a follow-up blog post, Jesse is going to go into much more detail on some of\nthe access control and tooling changes he had to solve to make this\nincrementals machinery work.\n\nOf course, incremental builds are only a piece of the puzzle, with those\nartifacts, Jenkins Essentials has to be able to do something useful with them!\n\nUpdate Improvements\n\nThe number one requirement, from my perspective, for the automatically updated\ndistribution is that it is safe. \"Safe\" means that a user doesn’t need to\nbe involved in the update process, and if something goes wrong, the\ninstance recovers without the user needing to do anything to remediate a\n\"bad code deploy.\"\n\nIn my previous post on the subject, I mentioned Baptiste’s work on\nJenkins Enhancement\nProposal 302 which describes the \"data safety\" system for safely applying\nupdates, and in case of failure, rolling back.\n\nThe next obvious question is \"what’s failure?\" which Baptiste spent some time\nexploring and implementing in two more designs:\n\nJEP-304: Essentials Client Error Telemetry Logging\n\nJEP-306: Essentials Instance Client Health Checking\n\nOn the server side, of which there is substantial work for Jenkins Essentials,\nthese concepts integrate with the concept of an\nUpdate Lifecycle\nbetween the server and client. In essence, the server side must be able to\ndeliver the right updates to the right clients, and avoid delivering tainted\nupdates (those with known problems) to clients. While this part of the work is\nstill on-going, tremendous progress has been made over the past couple weeks\nin ensuring that updates can be safely, securely, and automatically delivered.\n\nWith the ability to identify \"bad code deploys\", and having a mechanism for\nsafely rolling back, not only does Jenkins Essentials allow seamless\nupdates, but it enables Jenkins developers to deliver features and bugfixes\nmuch more quickly than our current distribution model allows.\n\nWhile Jenkins Essentials does not have a package ready for broad consumption\nyet, we’re rapidly closing in on the completion of our first milestone which\nties all of these automatic update components together and builds the\nfoundation for continuous delivery of all subsequent improvements.\n\nYou can follow our progress in the\njenkins-infra/evergreen\nrepository, or join us in our\nGitter chat!","title":"Jenkins Essentials: The days of versions are numbered","tags":["evergreen"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

This will of course not replace the existing distribution of Jenkins core and\nits plugins, which allow many of us large amounts of flexibility, but rather it\nwill make Jenkins easier for users who don’t want to \"build it themselves.\"\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more excited about the idea I became: Jenkins\nEssentials could open the door to new improvements and features in Jenkins\nwhich had been left in the \"idea and design\" phase going back almost two\nyears! Really, I checked, some of the concepts adopted into the design of\nJenkins Essentials were first conceived of in early 2016!\n\nKohsuke briefly discussed the project in\nhis previous blog post\nbut in post I wanted to expand on what Jenkins Essentials is, and our\nprogress has been in its development.\n\nWhat’s in Jenkins Essentials\n\nA few months ago I prepared\nthis presentation\nfor the\nFOSDEM 2018\nJenkins Contributor Summit, which outlines the following \"pillars\" or Jenkins\nEssentials, which are also described in\nJEP-300 :\n\nAutomatically Updated Distribution\n\nAutomatic Sane Defaults\n\nConnected\n\nObvious Path to User Success\n\nAutomatically Updated Distribution\n\nIn order to provide an easier-to-use and easier-to-manage Jenkins environment,\nJenkins Essentials will be distributed as an automatically self-updating\ndistribution, containing Jenkins core and a version-locked set of plugins\nconsidered \"essential.\" Rather than attempting to mirror the existing Weekly\nand LTS release lines for core, plus some plugin version matrix, Jenkins\nEssentials will update in a manner similar to Google Chrome.\n\nThis automatically updating distribution will mean that Jenkins Essentials will\nrequire significantly less overhead to manage, receiving improvements and bug\nfixes without any user involvement. From the user perspective, their Jenkins\nwill appear to automatically improve over time.\n\nThere is really interesting work being pioneered by\nBaptiste Mathus\nwith\nJEP-302\nto ensure that these automatic upgrades can be performed safely.\n\nAutomatic Sane Defaults\n\nProviding a core along with \"essential\" plugins is a good first step to helping\nJenkins users successfully automate their CI/CD workloads, but requires\nadditional \"smoothing\" over some of the numerous options and configurations\nplugins. Jenkins Essentials will perform some amount of \"automatic\nenvironment-based self-configuration.\"\n\nFor example, clicking a \"Launch Stack\" button from the Download\npage would launch an AWS-flavored Jenkins Essentials which, out of the box\nattempts to set up AWS-specific configuration with S3 and EC2 services.\n\nConnected\n\nIn order to provide a more seamless experience for end-users, and ensure that\nJenkins project developers receive useful error and usage telemetry to drive\nfurther improvements in Jenkins, Jenkins Essentials must necessarily be viewed\nas a \" Connected\" application. This means some yet-to-be-specified number of\nserver-side applications to coordinate updates, receive and process telemetry,\nbroker 3rd-party service authentications, relay webhooks, etc.\n\nObvious Path to User Success\n\nThe final pillar in Jenkins Essentials, is to ensure that Jenkins provides an\nobvious path for a user to configure and use it successfully. This largely\nentails in-application documentation, examples, and disabling legacy\nfunctionality within the application. All with the end goal of preventing users\nfrom inadvertently choosing legacy, or poorly supported, options when\nconfiguring their CI/CD workloads.\n\nProgress thus far\n\nSuffice it to say, Jenkins Essentials is a hugely ambitious project! We have\nbeen making steady progress however, as you can see in the\njenkins-infra/evergreen\nrepository on GitHub. We have been adamantly following the\nJenkins Enhancement Proposal\nprocess, and have been making sure our designs and implementations are clear as\nwe build them. Thus far we’ve written designs and implemented:\n\nJEP-300: Jenkins Essentials\n\nJEP-301: Evergreen packaging for Jenkins Essentials\n\nJEP-302: Evergreen snapshotting data safety system\n\nJEP-303: Evergreen Client Registration and Authentication\n\nJEP-304: Essentials Client Error Telemetry Logging\n\nUnfortunately we don’t yet have the first parts of the Automatically Updated Distribution working,\nwhich means you cannot download Jenkins Essentials today and get started with\nit. We’re still building the Jenkins-side and server-side components necessary\nto make the full feedback loop operate, without which we would not be able to\nsafely deliver new upgrades to Jenkins Essentials installations.\n\nIf you’re interested in getting involved, you can check out our\nGitter channel\nor our\nJira issues board.\n\nJenkins Essentials is just one major initiative going on in the Jenkins project\nthis year, so I hope you’re as excited as I am for the future of Jenkins!","title":"Jenkins Essentials: five minutes, five clicks","tags":["evergreen"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Originally filed as\nJENKINS-26481 in 2015,\nit became one of the most voted for, and watched, tickets in the entire issue\ntracker until it was ultimately fixed earlier this year.\n\nAt least some closures are executed only once inside of Groovy CPS DSL scripts\nmanaged by the workflow plugin.\n\n— Original bug description by Daniel Tschan\n\nAt a high level, what has been confusing for many users is that Scripted\nPipeline looks like a Groovy, it quacks like a Groovy, but it’s not exactly\nGroovy. Rather, there’s an custom Groovy interpreter\n( CPS) that executes the\nScripted Pipeline in a manner which provides the durability/resumability that\ndefines Jenkins Pipeline.\n\nWithout diving into too much detail, refer to the pull requests linked to\nJENKINS-26481 for that, the code snippet above was particularly challenging to\nrectify inside the Pipeline execution layer. As one of the chief architects for\nJenkins Pipeline, Jesse made a number of changes around the problem in 2016,\nbut it wasn’t until early 2017 when Andrew, working on Declarative Pipeline,\nstarted to identify a number of areas of improvement in CPS and provided\nmultiple patches and test cases.\n\nAs luck would have it, combining two of the sharpest minds in the Jenkins\nproject resulted in the \"Small Matter of Programming\" being finished, and\nreleased in May of this year with Pipeline: Groovy 2.33.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating, and thanking, Andrew and Jesse for their\ndiligent and hard work smashing one of the most despised bugs in Jenkins\nhistory :).","title":"Closure on enumerators in Pipeline","tags":["pipeline","jenkinsworld"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
