You can generalise this to other services too - such as BitBucket or DockerHub, or anything really that emits webhooks, but the instructions will be for GitHub projects hosted on github.com.\n\nWhat are webhooks\n\nJust a very quick refresher on what webhooks are: Messages (often JSON, but not always) typically posted by HTTP(S) from a server to a client that is listening for events.\n\nThe events flow left to right, Jenkins sits there happily listing on paths like /github-webhook/ or /dockerhub-webhook/ etc for some HTTP request to tell it to wake up and do some work.\n\nGitHub/BitBucket may be reporting a new commit or PR, or DockerHub reporting an upstream image has changed. What all these things have in common is that they push to Jenkins, and expect to be able to push to it (ie that Jenkins is visible to them). This works great when the network is open - say GitHub Enterprise, or Jenkins is listening on the web.\n\nNot on the web\n\nThe trick is when something gets in the middle, say a firewall:\n\n( As is industry standard, all firewalls have to be a wall on fire. Please don’t somehow set bricks on fire in your organisation)\n\nThis is just the same when you fire up Jenkins on your laptop, and want to receive webhooks from github.com (a legitimate thing, perhaps to test out your setup, perhaps to run builds for iOS on a mac, or some corner of a network that is not exposed to the web). Unless your laptop is addressable to the whole web that is (not likely), or your network is configured just right, the webhooks won’t be able to flow.\n\nThis is fine - we can fall back to polling for changes. Except this is terrible. You burn through API quotas, and you don’t get changes in real time, and really no one is happy.\n\nSome problems are opportunities\n\nWe can both solve this problem, but also, view this is an opportunity. Having things not addressable on the web, or locked down in some default way is a feature, not a bug. You massively reduce your attack surface, and can have defence in depth:\n\nA Webhook forwarding service\n\nEnter the memorably named Smee. This is an OSS project provided by GitHub and also helpfully hosted as a service by GitHub. This can capture and forward webhooks for you. I’ll try to explain it with a diagram:\n\nGitHub pushes an event (via HTTPS/json in this case) to Smee.io (the funny thing with circles, which is on the public web and accessible from GitHub.com) - and Jenkins in turn subscribes to Smee with an outgoing connection from a client. Note the direction of the arrows: Jenkins only makes an outbound connection.\n\nThis is the important point: this will work as long as the firewall is one way (like a NAT typically is, and many networks). If the Jenkins side can’t connect to anything on the outside world - well, this won’t help with that of course (but that is not often the case).\n\nSetting it up\n\nStep 1: Firstly - go to https://smee.io/ and click “Start a new channel”:\n\nThis will give you a unique URL (which you should copy for later use):\n\nNext you should install the smee client next to where you have the Jenkins server running:\n\nnpm install --global smee-client\n\n(This will make the smee client/command available to receive and forward webhooks).\n\nNow start the smee client and point it to your Jenkins server. In this case I have it running on port 8080 (the default if you fire it up on your laptop, change both the port and the smee URL as needed):\n\nsmee --url https://smee.io/GSm1B40sRfBvSjYS --path /github-webhook/ --port 8080\n\nThis says to connect to the smee service, and forward webhooks to /github-webhook/ (that trailing slash is important, don’t miss it). Once this is running, you will see it log that it is connected and forwarding webhooks. Leave this command running for as long as you want to receive webhooks.\n\nNext, you need to configure a pipeline that makes use of github. In this case I set up one from scratch. You can skip this if you already have a pipeline setup:\n\nI then chose “GitHub” as the where the code is:\n\nThen choose your repository. This will set things up ready to receive webhooks from GitHub. (also if you have an existing pipeline setup, and it is using GitHub as the SCM source, that is also fine).\n\nThe final step is to tell GitHub to post webhook events for that repository (or organization, you can do that too) to Smee (which ultimately means Jenkins will receive them).\n\nGo to the settings tab for your GitHub repository, and then click “add webhook”:\n\nNext, configure the webhook:\n\nPaste in the “smee” URL you copied from the step above.\n\nChoose application/json as the content type\n\nTell it to send everything (you can pick and choose what events, but I just did that as simpler).\n\nPress Add Webhook (or update)\n\nIt should look something like this:\n\nOK - webhooks should be flowing now. You can make a change to your repository, and check that a build starts soon after:\n\nGood luck!","title":"Triggering builds with webhooks behind a secure firewall","tags":["jenkins","webhooks","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/19e71/michaelneale.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/77b35/michaelneale.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/d4a57/michaelneale.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/19e71/michaelneale.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/ef6ff/michaelneale.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/8257c/michaelneale.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/6766a/michaelneale.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/michaelneale.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"michaelneale","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Michael is a CD enthusiast with a interest in User Experience.\nHe is a co-founder of CloudBees and a long time OSS developer, and can often be found\nlurking around the jenkins-dev mailing list or #jenkins on irc (same nick as twitter name).\nBefore CloudBees he worked at Red Hat.</p>\n</div>","id":"michaelneale","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Michael Neale","slug":"/blog/authors/michaelneale/","twitter":"michaelneale"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"f197eae4-55a6-578b-aa6b-0f8809ef8608","slug":"/blog/2018/06/21/jenkins-x-devpods/","strippedHtml":"I use macOS day to day, and often struggle to keep my devtools up to date.\nThis isn’t any fault of packaging or tools, more just that I get tired of seeing the beachball:\n\nThe demands on dev machines grow, developers are now working across a more diverse\nset of technologies than just a JVM or a single scripting language these days.\n\nThis keeping up to date is a drag on time (and thus money).\nThere are lots of costs involved with development, and I\nhave written about\nabout the machine cost for development (how using something like GKE can be much\ncheaper than buying a new machine) but there is also the cost of a developer’s time.\nThankfully, there are ways to apply the same smarts here to save time as well as money.\n And time is money, or money is time?\n\nGiven all the work done in automating the detection and installation of required\ntools, environments, and libraries that goes on when you run ‘jx import’ in\nJenkins X,\nit makes sense to also make those available for development time,\nand the concept of “DevPods” was born.\n\nThe pod part of the name comes from the Kubernetes concept of pods (but you don’t have to know about Kubernetes or pods to use Jenkins X. There is a lot to Kubernetes but Jenkins X aims to provide a developer experience that doesn’t require you to understand it).\n\nWhy not use Jenkins X from code editing all the way to production,\nbefore you even commit the code or open a pull request?\nAll the tools are there, all the environments are there, ready to use (as they are used at CI time!).\n\nThis rounds out the picture: Jenkins X aims to deal with the whole lifecycle for you,\nfrom ideas/issues, change requests, testing, CI/CD, security and compliance verification,\nrollout and monitoring. So it totally makes sense to include the actual dev time tools.\n\nIf you have an existing project, you can create a DevPod by running (with the jx command):\n\njx create devpod\n\nThis will detect what type of project is (using build packs) and create a DevPod\nfor you with all the tools pre-installed and ready to go.\n\nObviously, at this point you want to be able to make changes to your app and try it out.\nEither run unit tests in the DevPod, or perhaps see some dev version of the app running in your browser (if it is a web app).\nWeb-based code editors have been a holy grail for some time, but never have quite taken off in the mainstream of developers (despite there being excellent ones out there, most developers prefer to develop on their desktop).\nIronically, the current crop of popular editors are based around\n“electron” which is actually a web technology stack,\nbut it runs locally (Visual Studio Code is my personal favourite at the moment),\nin fact Visual Studio Code has a Jenkins X extension (but you don’t have to use it):\n\nTo get your changes up to the Dev Pod, in a fresh shell run (and leave it running):\n\njx sync\n\nThis will watch for any changes locally (say you want to edit files locally on your desktop)\nand sync them to the Dev Pod.\n\nFinally, you can have the Dev Pod automatically deploy an “edit” version of the\napp on every single change you make in your editor:\n\njx create devpod --sync --reuse\n./watch.sh\n\nThe first command will create or reuse an existing Dev Pod and open a shell to it,\nthen the watch command will pick up any changes, and deploy them to your “edit” app.\nYou can keep this open in your browser, make a change, and just refresh it.\nYou don’t need to run any dev tools locally, or any manual commands in the Dev Pod to do this, it takes care of that.\n\nYou can have many DevPods running (jx get devpods), and you could stop them at the end of the day (jx delete devpod), start them at the beginning, if you like (or as I say: keep them running in the hours between coffee and beer). A pod uses resources on your cluster, and as the Jenkins X project fleshes out its support for dev tools (via things like VS Code extensions) you can expect even these few steps to be automated away in the near future, so many of the above instructions will not be needed!\n\nEnd-to-end experience\n\nSo bringing it all together, let me show a very wide (you may need to zoom out) screen shot of this workflow:\n\nFrom Left to Right :\n\nI have my editor (if you look closely, you can see the Jenkins X extension showing the state of apps,\npipelines and the environments it is deployed to).\n\nIn the middle I have jx sync running, pushing changes up to the cloud from the editor,\nand also the ‘watch’ script running in the DevPod. This means every change I make in my editor,\na temporary version of the app (and its dependencies are deployed).\n\nOn the right is my browser open to the “edit” version of the app.\nJenkins X automatically creates an “edit” environment for live changes,\nso if I make a change to my source on the left, the code is synced,\nbuild/tested and updated so I can see the change on the right\n(but I didn’t build anything locally, it all happens in the DevPod on Jenkins X).\n\nOn visual studio code: The Jenkins X extension for visual studio code can automate the creation of devpods and syncing for you. Expect richer support soon for this editor and others.\n\nExplaining things with pictures\n\nTo give a big picture of how this hangs together:\n\nIn my example, GitHub is still involved, but I don’t push any changes back to it until I am happy with the state of my “edit app” and changes.\nI run the editor on my local workstation and jx takes care of the rest.\nThis gives a tight feedback loop for changes. Of course, you can use any editor you like,\nand build and test changes locally (there is no requirement to use DevPods to make use of Jenkins X).\n\nJenkins X comes with some ready to go environments: development, staging and production (you can add more if you like).\nThese are implemented as Kubernetes namespaces to avoid the wrong app things talking to the wrong place.\nThe development environment is where the dev tools live: and this is also where the DevPods can live!\nThis makes sense as all the tools are available, and saves the hassle of you having slightly different\nversions of tools on your local workstation than what you are using in your pipeline.\n\nDevPods are an interesting idea, and at the very least a cool name!\nThere will be many more improvements/enhancements in this area, so keep an eye out for them.\nThey are a work in progress, so do check the documentation page for better ways to use them.\n\nSome more reading:\n\nDocs on DevPods on jenkins-x.io\n\nThe Visual Studio Code extension\nfor Jenkins X (what a different world: an open source editor by Microsoft!)\n\nJames Strachan’s great intro\nto Jenkins X talk at Devoxx-UK also   includes a DevPod demo","title":"Using Jenkins X DevPods for development","tags":["jenkinsx","developer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/19e71/michaelneale.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/77b35/michaelneale.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/d4a57/michaelneale.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/19e71/michaelneale.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/ef6ff/michaelneale.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/8257c/michaelneale.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/6766a/michaelneale.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/michaelneale.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"michaelneale","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Michael is a CD enthusiast with a interest in User Experience.\nHe is a co-founder of CloudBees and a long time OSS developer, and can often be found\nlurking around the jenkins-dev mailing list or #jenkins on irc (same nick as twitter name).\nBefore CloudBees he worked at Red Hat.</p>\n</div>","id":"michaelneale","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Michael Neale","slug":"/blog/authors/michaelneale/","twitter":"michaelneale"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"c6c81158-09c3-5db5-9f8e-8e8ad25bd805","slug":"/blog/2018/06/20/anchore-image-scanning/","strippedHtml":"(adapted from this blog post by Daniel Nurmi)\n\nAs more and more Jenkins users ship docker containers, it is worth thinking about the security implications of this model, where the variance in software being included by developers has increased dramatically from previous models. Security implications in this context include what makes up the image, but also the components of the app that get bundled into your image. Docker images are increasingly becoming a “unit of deployment”, and if you look at a typical app (especially if it is a microservice), much of the components, libraries, and system are someone else’s code.\n\nAnchore exists to provide technology to act as a last line of defense, verifying the contents of these new deployable units against user specified policies to enforce security and compliance requirements. In this blog you will get a quick tour of this capability, and how to add the open-source Anchore Engine API service into your pipeline to validate that the flow of images you are shipping comply with your specific requirements, from a security point of view.\n\nKey among the fundamental tenets of agile development is the notion of “fail fast, fail often”, which is where CI/CD comes in: A developer commits code into the source code repository, such as git, that automatically triggers Jenkins to perform a build of the application that is then run through automated tests. If these tests fail the developer is notified immediately and can quickly correct the code. This level of automation increases the overall quality of code and speeds development.\n\nWhile some may feel that “fail fast” sounds rather negative (especially regarding security), you could better describe this process as “learn fast” as mistakes are found earlier in the development cycle and can be easily corrected. The increased use of CI/CD platforms such as Jenkins has helped to improve the efficiency of development teams and streamlined the testing process. We can leverage the same CI/CD infrastructure to improve the security of our container deployments.\n\nFor many organizations the last step before deploying an application is for the security team to perform an audit. This may entail scanning the image for vulnerable software components (like outdated packages that contain known security vulnerabilities) and verifying that the applications and OS are correctly configured. They may also check that the organization’s best practices and compliance policies have been correctly implemented.\n\nIn this post we walk through adding security and compliance checking into the CI/CD process so you can “learn fast” and correct any security or compliance issues early in the development cycle. This document will outline the steps to deploy Anchore’s open source security and compliance scanning engine with Jenkins to add analytics, compliance and governance to your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nAnchore has been designed to plug seamlessly into the CI/CD workflow, where a developer commits code into the source code management system, which then triggers Jenkins to start a build that creates a container image. In the typical workflow this container image is then run through automated testing. If an image does not meet your organization’s requirements for security or compliance then it makes little sense to invest the time required to perform automated tests on the image, it would be better to “learn fast” by failing the build and returning the appropriate reports back to the developer to allow the issue to be addressed.\n\nAnchore has published a plugin for Jenkins which, along with Anchore’s open source engine or Enterprise offering, allows container analysis and governance to be added quickly into the CI/CD process.\n\nRequirements\n\nThis guide presumes the following prerequisites have been met:\n\nJenkins 2.x installed and running on a virtual machine or physical server.\n\nAnchore-Engine installed and running, with accessible engine API URL (later referred to as) and credentials (later referred to as and) available - see Anchore Engine overview and installation.\n\nAnchore’s Jenkins plugin can work with single node installations or installations with multiple worker nodes.\n\nStep 1: Install the Anchore plugin\n\nThe Anchore plugin has been published in the Jenkins plugin registry and is available for installation on any Jenkins server. From the main Jenkins menu select Manage Jenkins, then Manage Plugins, select the Available tab, select and install Anchore Container Image Scanner.\n\nStep 2: Configure Anchore Plugin.\n\nOnce the Anchore Container Image Scanner plugin is installed - select Manage Jenkins menu click Configure System, and locate the Anchore Configuration section.  Select and enter the following parameters in this section:\n\nClick Enable Anchore Scanning\n\nSelect Engine Mode\n\nEnter your in the Engine URL text box - for example: http://your-anchore-engine.com:8228/v1\n\nEnter your and in the Engine Username and Engine Password fields, respectively\n\nClick Save\n\nAn example of a filled out configuration section is below, where we’ve used “http://192.168.1.3:8228/v1” as, “admin” as and “foobar” as :\n\nAt this point the Anchore plugin is configured on Jenkins, and is available to be accessed by any project to perform Anchore security and policy checks as part of your container image build pipeline.\n\nStep 3: Add Anchore image scanning to a pipeline build.\n\nIn the Pipeline model the entire build process is defined as code. This code can be created, edited and managed in the same way as any other artifact of your software project, or input via the Jenkins UI.\n\nPipeline builds can be more complex including forks/joins and parallelism. The pipeline is more resilient and can survive the controller node failure and restarts. To add an Anchore scan you need to add a simple code snippet to any existing pipeline code that first builds an image and pushes it to a docker registry. Once the image is available in a registry accessible by your installed Anchore Engine, a pipeline script will instruct the Anchore plugin to:\n\nSend an API call to the Anchore Engine to add the image for analysis\n\nWait for analysis of the image to complete by polling the engine\n\nSend an API call to the Anchore Engine service to perform a policy evaluation\n\nRetrieve the evaluation result and potentially fail the build if the plugin is configured to fail the build on policy evaluation STOP result (by default it will)\n\nProvide a report of the policy evaluation for review\n\nBelow is an example end-to-end script that will make a Dockerfile, use the docker plugin to build and push the a docker container image to dockerhub, perform an Anchore image analysis on the image and the result, and cleanup the built container.  In this example, we’re using a pre-configured docker-exampleuser named dockerhub credential for dockerhub access, and exampleuser/examplerepo:latest as the image to build and push.  These values would need to be changed to reflect your own local settings, or you can use the below example to extract the analyze stage to integrate an anchore scan into any pre-existing pipeline script, any time after a container image is built and is available in a docker registry that your anchore-engine service can access.\n\npipeline {\n    agent any\n    stages {\n        stage('build') {\n            steps {\n                sh'''\n                    echo 'FROM debian:latest’ > Dockerfile\n                    echo ‘CMD [\"/bin/echo\", \"HELLO WORLD....\"]' >> Dockerfile\n                '''\n                script {\n                    docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', 'docker-exampleuser') {\n                        def image = docker.build('exampleuser/examplerepo:latest')\n                        image.push()\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        stage('analyze') {\n            steps {\n                sh 'echo \"docker.io/exampleuser/examplerepo:latest `pwd`/Dockerfile\" > anchore_images'\n                anchore name: 'anchore_images'\n            }\n        }\n        stage('teardown') {\n            steps {\n                sh'''\n                    for i in `cat anchore_images | awk '{print $1}'`;do docker rmi $i; done\n                '''\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis code snippet writes out the anchore_images file that is read by the plugin to determine which image is to be added to Anchore Engine for scanning.\n\nThis code snippet can be crafted by hand or built using the Jenkins UI, for any Pipeline project. In the project configuration, select Pipeline Syntax from the Project.\n\nThis will launch the Snippet Generator where you can enter the available plugin parameters and press the Generate Pipeline Script button which will produce a snippet that you can use as a starting point.\n\nUsing our example from above, next we save the project:\n\nNote that once you are happy with your script, you could also check it into a Jenkinsfile, alongside the source code.\n\nStep 4: Run the build and review the results.\n\nFinally, we run the build, which will generate a report.  In the below screenshots, we’ve scanned the image docker.io/library/debian:latest to demonstrate some example results.  Once the build completes, the final build report will have some links that will take you to a page that describes the result of the Anchore Engine policy evaluation and security scan:\n\nIn this case, since we left the Fail build on policy STOP result as its default (True), the build has failed due to anchore-engine reporting a policy violation.  In order to see the results, click the Anchore Report (STOP) link:\n\nHere, we can see that there is a single policy check that has generated a ‘STOP’ action, which triggered due to a high severity vulnerability being found against a package installed in the image.  If there were only ‘WARN’ or ‘GO‘ check results here, they would also be displayed, but the build would have succeeded.\n\nWith the combination of Jenkins pipeline project capabilities, plus the Anchore scanner plugin, it’s quick and easy to add container image security scanning and policy checking to your Jenkins project.  In this example, we provide the mechanism for adding scanning to a Jenkins pipeline project using a simple policy that is doing an OS package vulnerability scan, but there are many more policy options that can be configured and loaded into Anchore Engine ranging from security checks to your own site-specific best practice checks (software licenses, package whitelist/blacklist, dockerfile checks, and many more).  For more information about the breadth of Anchore policies, you can find information about Anchore Engine configuration and usage here.\n\nFor more information on Jenkins Pipelines and Anchore Engine, check out the following information sources:\n\nhttps://anchore.com/\n\nhttps://anchore.com/opensource/\n\nhttps://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine\n\nhttps://anchore.freshdesk.com/support/home\n\nChat on Anchore open source slack","title":"Securing your Jenkins CI/CD Container Pipeline with Anchore (in under 10 minutes)","tags":["community","developer","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/19e71/michaelneale.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/77b35/michaelneale.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/d4a57/michaelneale.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/19e71/michaelneale.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/ef6ff/michaelneale.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/8257c/michaelneale.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/6766a/michaelneale.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/michaelneale.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"michaelneale","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Michael is a CD enthusiast with a interest in User Experience.\nHe is a co-founder of CloudBees and a long time OSS developer, and can often be found\nlurking around the jenkins-dev mailing list or #jenkins on irc (same nick as twitter name).\nBefore CloudBees he worked at Red Hat.</p>\n</div>","id":"michaelneale","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Michael Neale","slug":"/blog/authors/michaelneale/","twitter":"michaelneale"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","id":"de012828-154d-5d83-8b81-e1199eaa8685","slug":"/blog/2018/04/10/opinionated-cd-jenkins-x/","strippedHtml":"I\nrecently wrote\nabout how all the cloud platforms are all in Kubernetes and so are developers.\nIt is an exciting time, but the problem for many is that this is\na huge blank sheet of paper for how to build and deploy applications.\nA white space, a void, a limitless canvas of possibilities.\nInsert metaphors here.\n\nThe problem, as you may guess, is that few people really like or are able to start with a blank canvas.\nI know I prefer to start with something working and iterate towards a solution,\nor be given some rails to stay on (again with the metaphors).\n\nThat’s where the Jenkins X project comes in.\nJenkins X is a Kubernetes-native continuous integration and continuous delivery platform\nfor developing cloud native applications that was recently introduced as a\nJenkins Enhancement Proposal,\nsponsored by James Strachan.\n\nThere is a lot to take in but at it’s heart,\nthis is an open source opinionated way to do continuous delivery with Kubernetes,\nnatively, without necessarily having to learn all the things I talked about in my last blog post.\nI shall attempt to explain what this is all about and why it matters to developers.\nAs someone said on the jenkins-dev mailing list\n“We have the two glued together with baling wire and twine” -\nJenkins X aims to simplify how to work with continuous delivery and Kubernetes.\n\nFirst and most importantly, let’s see the logo:\n\nYou can see the nautical theme leaking through (and Kubernetes).\nWhilst it is called Jenkins X, it is about quite a lot more than Jenkins.\n\nJenkins X makes decisions for you\n\nJenkins X presents itself to you initially as a handy sleek command line\n(a native binary you can install called jx - the debate is on as to how pronounce it).\nLet’s take a tour (sail?):\n\njx import my-app\n\nIf you have an existing project, this will detect what type of project it is, build a pipeline for you (and a bunch of Kubernetes things, like Helm Charts), add it to your project and set it up in GitHub, WebHooks and all, build the project (run the pipeline) and deploy a version to a “staging” environment.\n\nIf it looks ok, you can promote it to production:\n\njx promote --env production --version 1.0.1 my-app\n\nIf something went wrong in production, you can roll back an app to any version (the version numbers are made for you):\n\njx promote --env production --version 1.0.0 my-app\n> jx get apps # list versions\n\nAn environment is a well-established concept for web developers using\ncontinuous delivery: out of the box Jenkins X makes three of them for you\n(dev, staging and production), but you can make as many as you like.\nEnvironments have rules around how things are promoted into them\n(and they also have their own extensible pipelines,\nbut you can just use them as-is to start).\n\nYou can also create a Spring Boot microservice app:\n\njx create spring\n\nAnswer a few questions and it will set everything up for you.\n\nAny changes you make to your app automatically are built,\nand if the build looks good, they go through to the staging environment.\nWebHooks are setup for you (if you are using GitHub) to smooth this over.\n\nFor those looking at starting from pre-made apps, there are \"quickstarts\":\n\njx create quickstart\n\nThey are based on a growing set of starter apps, in a variety of languages and tech stacks.\n\nReview apps for your changes: Each pull request is built/tested,\nand a “review app” is made available in a temporary environment.\nThat means each proposed change, before it goes to the default branch (master),\nhas an environment made (temporary) that it can be tried out in.\nIn GitHub, this shows up as a comment in the pull request:\n\nProject type detection\n\nAs you can see, so far there is no editing or manual creation of pipelines,\nor scripting or setup, just importing or creating your app and go.\nThis is powered by\nDraft “packs”\n(a handy project that came out of Azure).\n What you end up with is a Jenkinsfile in your project repository.\n You may want to edit it one day, or you may be happy with it as is!\n Jenkins is famous for being un-opinionated in what you do,\n but Jenkins X has strong opinions (but you can extend and customise).\n\nimage::/images/jenkins-x/draft-logo.png[Draft Logo, width=300]\n\nDeploying or promoting to environments\n\nDeploying happens via pipelines behind the scenes -\nwhen a change is pushed, or a version promoted.\nYou don’t need to directly interact with Kubernetes if you don’t need to.\nA tool called Helm does the heavy lifting:\nHelm is used to package and perform installations and upgrade for your apps.\n\nThere is a little more magic going on here with environments, which you don’t see at first.\nEach environment, for a team, is represented by a Git repository behind the scenes.\nConfiguration as code is a well-established best practice these days,\nso why not use it to track deployments and initiate deployments.\nI also mentioned in my previous post how declarative Kubernetes is:\nit is perfect for keeping all config in a repository, of the desired system state.\n\nEach promotion is actually a pull request to a per-environment repository.\nThis repository is made and managed for you (and kept outside of the\nmain application code repository), you don’t have to look at it,\nbut you can extend things there should you need to.\nSpecific environment repositories may have different access rules,\nor be controlled by a different team (perhaps even deploy to a different cluster).\nSome have coined the term for this as “GitOps.”\nI first came across this concept on a\nWeaveWorks blog.\n\nI’ll try and explain this one with a diagram:\n\nThe pipeline is actually split in the middle.\nOn the left is the more familiar continuous integration pipeline.\nThis works on pull requests, pre-release version of things\nand is all about testing(automated and manual review).\nThe source of truth for this is the configuration in the\napplications repository: branches, pull requests and so on.\n\nThe right-hand side is the continuous delivery pipeline.\nThis kicks in when the application is ready to be updated with a new release.\nThis is the “GitOps” repo behind the scenes that controls the state of things in Kubernetes.\nA promotion on this side is a pull request, and then a merge,\nfrom the staging repository to the production repository.\n\nInstalling Jenkins X\n\nThe jx command line has a jx install command that installs it into a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThe best experience initially is using Google’s excellent GKE service:\n\njx create cluster gke\n\nThis will ask a few questions, and go and set it all up for you in a\ncluster set aside for Jenkins X (recommended).\nJenkins X runs entirely as services on top of a Kubernetes cluster.\n\njx install\n\nIs designed to work with a Kubernetes cluster (if it already exists,\nrecommendation is to have a cluster put aside for Jenkins X if possible).\nAmazon EKS support is coming (mostly it is around testing),\nthat service is in beta/early access so it is still a work in progress,\nas is Microsoft Azures excellent AKS service.\n\nSo where is Jenkins?\n\nGood question, thanks for asking. Well, it is behind the scenes.\nAs you have seen, there was no direct interaction with Jenkins,\nbut it is there, running the pipelines for continuous integration and\ncontinuous delivery of the respective repositories, and orchestrating things with Kubernetes.\n\nIf you run jx get pipelines you can see URLs to the various pipelines\nthat have been setup for you are part of interacting with Jenkins X.\n\nBy the way,\nJames Strachan has written an extensive blog on jenkins.io\nthat really explores the Jenkins X project in-depth.\nOnce you finish reading this blog, take a stroll on over there and read James'.\nHe also provides several ways you can get involved in the project.\n\nWhat else can I do with the command line?\n\nLots, the jx command line has built in help:\n\njx open\n\nopen apps, services or pipelines in your browser\n\njx activity\n\nexplains how things got to where they are, a history\n\njx get environments\n\nlist environments\n\njx get apps\n\nshow the state of applications, what versions are in what environments.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nThere is a whole lot more to this, and lots more moving parts and services\nthat are set up for you that are very useful, but it is best to head over\nto jenkins-x.io and have a look.\n\nThis project is obviously in early stages (it is stll a Draft JEP after all) and there is lots happening.\nCheck out the Jenkins X community\nif you want to chat on slack, IRC, issues or email.\nAlso, read the\nJenkins Enhancement Proposal doc.","title":"Opinionated Kubernetes and Jenkins X","tags":["jenkins-x","kubernetes","pipeline"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/19e71/michaelneale.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/77b35/michaelneale.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/d4a57/michaelneale.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/19e71/michaelneale.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/ef6ff/michaelneale.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/8257c/michaelneale.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/6766a/michaelneale.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/michaelneale.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"michaelneale","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Michael is a CD enthusiast with a interest in User Experience.\nHe is a co-founder of CloudBees and a long time OSS developer, and can often be found\nlurking around the jenkins-dev mailing list or #jenkins on irc (same nick as twitter name).\nBefore CloudBees he worked at Red Hat.</p>\n</div>","id":"michaelneale","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Michael Neale","slug":"/blog/authors/michaelneale/","twitter":"michaelneale"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","id":"20effc32-f67a-56da-9fc9-3f46f4c7bf1a","slug":"/blog/2017/03/17/blueocean-devlog-mar3/","strippedHtml":"We’re counting down the weeks until Blue Ocean 1.0,\nand we’re getting close!
