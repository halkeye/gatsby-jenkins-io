I am a second year student at Maseno\nUniversity. I am currently specializing on Ruby on Rails and trying to learn\nPython. I recently started contributing to Open source projects.My major\ncontribution was at Mozilla, where I worked with the QA for Cloud services. I did\nmanual and automated tests for various cloud services. I wrote documentation\ntoo. Above that, I am competent and I am always passionate about what I get my\nhands on.\n\nProject summary\n\nCurrently Jenkins plugin documentation is being stored in Confluence. Sometimes\nthe documentation is scattered and outdated. In order to improve the situation we\nwould like to follow the documentation-as-code approach and to put docs to\nplugin repositories and then publish them on the project website using the\nawestruct engine. The project aims an implementation of a documentation\ncontinuous deployment flow powered by Jenkins and Pipeline Plugin.\n\nThe idea is to automatically pull in the README and other docs from GitHub, show\nchangelogs with versions and releases dates. I will be designing file templates\nthat will contain most of the  docs information that will be required from\nplugin developers. Initially the files will be written in\nAsciiDoc. Plugin developers will get a chance to\nreview the templates. The templates will be prototyped by various plugin\ndevelopers.\n\nThe docs that will be automatically pulled from github and will be published on\nJenkins.io under the Documentation section.\n\nMy mentors are R.Tyler and\nBaptiste Mathus\n\nI hope to achieve this by 25th June when we will be having our mid-term\nevaluations.\n\nI will update more on the progress.\n\nLinks\n\nGsoc Page\n\nJenkins Gsoc Page\n\nMailing List discussion on Jenkins-Developers\n\nMy blog on Medium","title":"GSOC Project Intro: Automatic Plugin Documentation","tags":["gsoc","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"anyangocynthia","html":"","id":"cynthia","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Cynthia Anyango","slug":"/blog/authors/cynthia","twitter":"annyanngo"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"cynthia","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
