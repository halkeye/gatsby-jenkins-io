The contributor summit is the place where the current and future contributors of the Jenkins project get together. This year, the theme is “working together”. Traditionally, most contributors are plugin maintainers focusing on their own plugins, but it’s important to look at Jenkins as a whole, because that’s how users experience it. There is more to the project beyond writing plugins, and even for plugin developers, there are increasing number of common libraries and modules that plugins should rely on. In short, we should work better together.\n\nA few contributors will prepare some presentations to help clarify what that means, and what all of us can do. And in the afternoon, there will be \"unconference\" sessions to brainstorm and discuss what we can do and how.\n\nWhether you are already a contributor or just thinking about becoming one, please join us for this full day free event.\n\nDetails about this year’s agenda are available on the event’s meetup page.\nAttending is free, and no Jenkins World ticket is needed, but RSVP if you’re going to attend to help us plan.\n\nSee you there!","title":"Jenkins World Contributor

just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.57 and 2.46.2, that fix several security vulnerabilities, including a critical one.\n\nThat critical vulnerability is an unauthenticated remote code execution via the remoting-based CLI.\nWhen I announced the fix for the previous vulnerability of this kind, I announced our plans to revisit the design of the CLI that enabled this class of vulnerabilities.\n\nSince Jenkins 2.54, we now have a new CLI implementation that isn’t based on remoting, and deprecated its remoting mode.\nDespite it being a major feature, we decided to backport it to 2.46.2, so LTS users can also disable the unsafe remoting mode while retaining almost all of the CLI’s existing functionality.\n\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\nFor an overview on the possible impact of these changes on upgrading Jenkins LTS, see our LTS upgrade guide.\nI recommend you read these documents, especially if you’re using the CLI with Jenkins LTS, as there are possible side effects of these fixes.\n\nSubscribe to the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list to receive important notifications related to Jenkins

response to the zero-day vulnerability we fixed in November, I wrote the following:\n\nMoving forward, the Jenkins security team is revisiting the design of the Jenkins CLI over the coming weeks to prevent this class of vulnerability in the future.\nIf you are interested in participating in that discussion, please join in on the jenkinsci-dev@ mailing list.\n\nIn early February, several project contributors met after FOSDEM for a one day hackathon.\nI looked into the feasibility of a purely SSH-based CLI.\nWhile I considered the experiment to be a success, it was far from ready to be used in a production environment.\n\nA few weeks later, long-time contributor and Jenkins security team member Jesse Glick took over, and published a detailed proposal for a new, simple CLI protocol without remoting.\n\nIn just a month, he implemented his proposal, and I’m very happy to announce that this new implementation of the Jenkins CLI has now made it into 2.54!\n\nExisting jenkins-cli.jar clients should continue working as before, unless an administrator disables the remoting connection mode in Configure Global Security.\nThat said, we recommend you download the new jenkins-cli.jar in Jenkins, and use its new -http mode.\nWith few (now deprecated) exceptions, CLI commands work like before.\nThis will allow you to disable the remoting mode for the CLI on the Jenkins controller to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.\n\nSSH-based CLI use should be unaffected by this change.\nNote that new Jenkins instances now start with the SSH server port disabled, and the configuration option for that was moved into Configure Global Security.\n\nYou can learn all about the CLI and its new behavior in the Jenkins handbook.","title":"New, safer CLI in
