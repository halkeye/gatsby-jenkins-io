security updates well in advance on the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list, to give Jenkins administrators time to schedule a maintenance.\nAdditionally, we try to align security updates with the regular LTS schedule.\nWe have chosen not to do so in this case for two reasons:\n\nThe random failure to set up Jenkins is very noticeable, and given that we’ve seen automated exploits for unprotected Jenkins instances in the past we consider it important to fix that issue as soon as possible, so that users setting up new instances of Jenkins can be confident they won’t start up insecurely.\n\nThe CSRF issue appears to only affect instances for a very short (seconds at most, if at all) time period immediately after startup, so administrators could apply the fix during the next scheduled Jenkins downtime, rather than immediately.","title":"Security updates for Jenkins

The contributor summit is the place where the current and future contributors of the Jenkins project get together. This year, the theme is “working together”. Traditionally, most contributors are plugin maintainers focusing on their own plugins, but it’s important to look at Jenkins as a whole, because that’s how users experience it. There is more to the project beyond writing plugins, and even for plugin developers, there are increasing number of common libraries and modules that plugins should rely on. In short, we should work better together.\n\nA few contributors will prepare some presentations to help clarify what that means, and what all of us can do. And in the afternoon, there will be \"unconference\" sessions to brainstorm and discuss what we can do and how.\n\nWhether you are already a contributor or just thinking about becoming one, please join us for this full day free event.\n\nDetails about this year’s agenda are available on the event’s meetup page.\nAttending is free, and no Jenkins World ticket is needed, but RSVP if you’re going to attend to help us plan.\n\nSee you there!","title":"Jenkins World Contributor Summit","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2017"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and member of the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe was the inaugural Jenkins security officer from 2015 to 2021.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure in his spare time.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d81f1582-c3e8-5662-bd12-92e53401c9f2","slug":"/blog/2017/04/26/security-advisory/","strippedHtml":"We just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.57 and 2.46.2, that fix several security vulnerabilities, including a critical one.\n\nThat critical vulnerability is an unauthenticated remote code execution via the remoting-based CLI.\nWhen I announced the fix for the previous vulnerability of this kind, I announced our plans to revisit the design of the CLI that enabled this class of vulnerabilities.\n\nSince Jenkins 2.54, we now have a new CLI implementation that isn’t based on remoting, and deprecated its remoting mode.\nDespite it being a major feature, we decided to backport it to 2.46.2, so LTS users can also disable the unsafe remoting mode while retaining almost all of the CLI’s existing functionality.\n\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\nFor an overview on the possible impact of these changes on upgrading Jenkins LTS, see our LTS upgrade guide.\nI recommend you read these documents, especially if you’re using the CLI with Jenkins LTS, as there are possible side effects of these fixes.\n\nSubscribe to the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list to receive important notifications related to Jenkins security.","title":"Important security updates for Jenkins core","tags":["core","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and member of the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe was the inaugural Jenkins security officer from 2015 to 2021.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure in his spare time.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"daniel-beck","limit":8,"skip":16,"numPages":7,"currentPage":3}},
