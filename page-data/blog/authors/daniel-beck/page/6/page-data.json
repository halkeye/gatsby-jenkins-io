Regardless of whether the agent.jar is launched through a Java Web Start or SSH launcher, the jar will be copied from https://yourserver:port/jnlpJars/agent.jar to the build node. Keeping this jar up to date ensures that it picks up the newest features in a more recent release, such as the self-restart feature to keep agent JVMs “clean” and to automatically reconnect to their controller. Additionally, newer versions of this component may fix bugs or implement newer protocol versions with various improvements.\n\nWhat is the Version Column Plugin?\n\nLaunch methods designed to pull the latest agent.jar are not always reliable and some launch methods don’t even try to update the agent.jar. Therefore it can be useful to see what agent.jar version is running on a given build node and take offline any nodes which fails to update to the latest version of the jar.\n\nThe Version Column Plugin allows Jenkins controllers to do just this, adding a new column to the “Manage Nodes” view and a new option for version enforcement on the node configuration screen.\n\nGetting started\n\nAfter installing the Version Column Plugin, navigate to the list of nodes in your Jenkins instance by clicking Build Executor Status in the executors widget below the side panel on the Jenkins home page.\n\nIf the plugin installed successfully, you will see a new column simply called “Version”. This column displays the version of the agent.jar that each build node is using.\n\nThis column is simply displaying the versions, so enforcement of agent.jar versions will need to be configured elsewhere. To activate this, click on the “Configure” link in the node manager’s left-hand menu.\n\nYou will then see a set of options for agents. To activate version enforcement, check the “Version” box and apply your changes.\n\nWhen you update Jenkins, there’s a chance it’ll come with a new version of agent.jar. Now if the agent.jar on a particular agent doesn’t get updated automatically, the controller will take it offline and show a warning next to the out-of-date agent version number:\n\nThe Version Column Plugin is available for download in the Jenkins plugin manager or from its wiki page.","title":"Plugin Spotlight: Version Column Plugin","tags":["general","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and, as security officer, leads the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck/","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"f5780b57-95a9-5ef9-ae2b-4adec694d1bd","slug":"/blog/2015/08/25/announcing-the-travel-grant-program/","strippedHtml":"We’re currently setting up a program to support community members' travel to Jenkins community events. Our goal is to enable more members of the community to meet each other and exchange ideas in person.\n\nWe’re still hashing out the details, but it’ll be available to every Jenkins community member. Apply, telling us what Jenkins-related event you’d like to attend and how awesome you are, and we may support your travel with up to 500 USD. For details on how this will work, see the current draft of the travel grant program.\n\nThe first person to be supported in this way is Pradeepto Bhattacharya from Pune, India. He was a speaker at this year’s JUC Europe in London, and will give two talks at JUC US West next week—​and we help him get there! He asked us a few weeks back whether the Jenkins project could support his trip to the US. We came to the conclusion that this would be a good idea—​so good in fact, that we decided to build a regular program from it.\n\nAre you planning to attend a JUC or similar event, but worry about the cost of travel?

Fortunately, we had the binary logs from the 17th through the 30th. This means that though most data could be restored, some data from between the 15th and the 17th was lost.\n\nFor our issue tracker, that means that issues JENKINS-29432 to JENKINS-29468 were lost, as well as comments posted from about July 15 12:20 PM to July 17 2 AM (UTC).
