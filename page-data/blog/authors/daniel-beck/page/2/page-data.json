of the major strengths of Jenkins is its customizability and extensibility.\nWith its plugin ecosystem and long list of (possibly hidden) options, Jenkins can be used for a wide range of use cases.\n\nThe downside of all this flexibility is that, not knowing how people use Jenkins, we mostly rely on issues filed in our bug tracker to know when things go wrong.\nAnd over the years, quite a few things have gone wrong.\nThe worst of these have been security fixes that have had unintended side effects.\nUnlike regular changes, it’s not really feasible to roll back security fixes, so users have sometimes had to choose between security and functionality.\nBut even changes developed in the open, such as the introduction of JEP-200, haven’t gone as smoothly as we hoped.\nWith big changes in the works, it’s more important than ever for us to have a better idea how Jenkins is used, so that we can deliver major changes safely.\n\nJenkins Evergreen solves this to some degree by being always connected to the Jenkins project and reporting back telemetry (mostly errors) allowing us to quickly react and provide fixes.\nBut that project is still pretty new, and its goal of being a more standardized Jenkins does not represent the breadth of configurations of the general user base.\n\nUplink telemetry\n\nSo we recently extended the existing, very limited anonymous usage statistics by adding a simple, extensible telemetry reporting client.\nWe’re calling it Uplink telemetry, based on the name of the service it reports its data to.\nIt made its debut in Jenkins 2.143.\n\nUplink telemetry is designed to collect data in trials, which are defined as:\n\na well defined set of technical data with a specific purpose\n\na start and end date of the collection\n\nDetailed information explaining the scope and purpose of currently active trials is available in the inline help for the usage statistics control in the global configuration.\n\nOf course, opting out of anonymous usage statistics there also disables the submission of Uplink telemetry.\nAnd while Uplink trials report a per-instance UUID to help with collation (e.g. removal of duplicate submissions), that UUID is exclusively used for this purpose, and independent of all other properties of an instance.\nThis prevents us from correlating reported data with specific instances.\nThese measures are in place to strike a balance between the need to understand how Jenkins is used and respecting users' privacy.\n\nImproving Jenkins through real-world data\n\nWe’re already created our first trial.\nJenkins 2.143 includes a trial to gather information about how common it is for instances to use Java system properties to disable (parts of) security fixes.\nWhen we publish a security fix and we’re not completely certain it is safe to apply for everyone, we add another of these options — just in case.\nAs you can imagine, quite a few of these hidden options exist.\nUntil now, user feedback in our issue tracker was the only way we could estimate the need for any of these options.\nWith Uplink, Jenkins will report that information to us.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to run for the next six weeks, enough to hopefully gather this information from a large number of users of both LTS and weekly releases.\nOur hope is that we will be able to remove some of these options entirely, as they might not be needed after all.\nFor others, we might need to consider elevating them to supported features, or finding better solutions obviating the need for them.\n\nIn the future, I will publish of some of what we have learned from the first trial running through Uplink telemetry.\nI look forward to Jenkins continuing to improve with real-world data informing our future decisions.","title":"Improving Jenkins

year, news of compromised passwords being used for accounts able to distribute NPM packages made the rounds.\n\nTheir system looks similar to how publishing of plugins works in the Jenkins project:\n\nAccounts are protected by passwords chosen by users.\n\nIndividual contributors have permission to release the components they maintain.\n\nThe components they release are used by millions of developers around the world to deliver their software.\n\nIn other words, weak passwords are a problem for us just as much as for NPM, and what happened to them could happen to us.\n\nTo address this problem, the Jenkins security and infra teams have recently collaborated on a password audit.\nThe audit covered all accounts with permissions to upload plugins and components, and on accounts with other levels of privileged infrastructure access.\nWe ran brute force tools on salted password hashes of those accounts looking for \"weak\" passwords — passwords present in a set of publicly available password lists we chose for this audit.\n\nWe checked the password of every qualifying account for every unsafe password rather than trying to match them to any previous password leaks' email/password pairs.\nUsers with weak account passwords were notified via email a few weeks ago and were asked to change their password to something stronger.\n\nWe performed the same checks over the previous weekend, but this time we only checked the passwords of accounts whose passwords were deemed weak during our first check.\nWe then invalidated the password of any account whose password was still not considered \"strong\" (i.e. their password was unchanged or had been changed to another weak password).\nUsers of those accounts will need to request a password reset before signing in again.\n\nWe plan to implement further safeguards, including improving the account management app at https://accounts.jenkins.io to reject weak passwords.\nIf you’re interested in helping the security team make Jenkins more secure, let us know on the jenkinsci-dev mailing list, or request to join the security team.","title":"Jenkins community account password
