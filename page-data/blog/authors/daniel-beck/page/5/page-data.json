The bug does not affect Jenkins 1.653 or newer, or Jenkins LTS\n1.642.4 or newer.\n\nIf you cannot upgrade, it is possible to immediately disable submission of\nusage statistics by running the following script in \"Manage Jenkins » Script Console\":\n\nhudson.model.UsageStatistics.DISABLED = true\n\nThis will immediately disable usage data submission until you restart Jenkins.\nTo make this permanent, change your Jenkins startup script so it passes a\nsystem property to the java process:\n\njava -Dhudson.model.UsageStatistics.disabled=true -jar …/jenkins.war\n\nFor information how to do this when using one of the installers/packages, see the\ninstaller/package documentation here.\n\nTo verify that usage stats submission is disabled, run the following script in\n\"Manage Jenkins » Script Console\" and confirm the result is true:\n\nprintln hudson.model.UsageStatistics.DISABLED\n\nWe have much more information about the issue and our usage statistics process\nin\nour wiki.\n\nWhile we do not consider this a security advisory, if you are a Jenkins\nadministrator we highly recommend subscribing to our\njenkinsci-advisories@\nmailing list.","title":"Important notice regarding usage statistics","tags":["general"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and member of the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe was the inaugural Jenkins security officer from 2015 to 2021.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure in his spare time.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9efc9db9-9325-5046-a1fb-6db8d9a413f3","slug":"/blog/2016/03/24/jenkins-2-beta-released/","strippedHtml":"We released the Jenkins 2.0 beta earlier today. Download it here and try it!\n\nBesides a number of bug fixes and minor improvements, the following changes are new since the last alpha preview release:\n\nRedesigned \"New Item\" page\n\nWe redesigned the \"New Item\" page. Item types now have icons to be more visually distinctive.\n\nAdditionally, item types can now define a category they belong to (such as \"Project\" or \"Folder\"). Once the complexity of the \"New Item\" page reaches a certain threshold, the item types will be grouped into categories to be easier to find. However, for now, it’s unlikely that you will see these categories, as support for this mechanism will need to be added in plugins. This is a new API in core, and we invite plugin developers to support it to make Jenkins easier to use for users with a large number of item types. It doesn’t even require raising the minimum supported Jenkins version.\n\nSeparate configuration page for tools\n\nThe length and complexity of the Configure Jenkins page once a few dozen plugins are installed made it unnecessarily difficult to use. To improve that we’re moving the tools configuration (Git, Maven, Gradle, Ant, etc.) out of that page, into the new Global Tools Configuration.\n\nUpgrade notice and plugin installer\n\nThe Pipeline plugin suite is a big part of Jenkins 2. Over the past few weeks, open-source plugins adding support for visualization (Pipeline Stage View), automatic GitHub project creation (GitHub Branch Source Plugin) and Bitbucket project creation (Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin) have been released. However, when upgrading from Jenkins 1.x, users weren’t even given any information on these features.\n\nTo address this, users upgrading from Jenkins 1.x will now be shown a banner when they first log into Jenkins as administrator, offering them to install the suite of Pipeline plugins.","title":"Jenkins 2.0 beta released","tags":["jenkins2"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and member of the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe was the inaugural Jenkins security officer from 2015 to 2021.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure in his spare time.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d6d93563-02b9-5e71-a6da-874bfa5517c1","slug":"/blog/2016/03/11/new-jenkins-20-preview/","strippedHtml":"We just published the new Jenkins 2.0-alpha-3 preview build.\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nJenkins is now secure out of the box :\nAdministrators previously had to set up authentication and authorization\nwhile Jenkins was accessible to anyone on the same network.  Now, Jenkins is\nprotected out of the box, so that it is always safe from unauthorized\naccess.\n\nPlugin selection for setup :\nWe refined the plugin selection on the setup dialog.\nYou’ve always wondered why Jenkins does not install the Git Plugin by default?\nNow it does, along with a number of other plugins popular in the Jenkins community.\nWe’re also including more plugins complementing the\nPipeline plugin :\nThe\nPipeline\nStage View plugin lets you quickly see what’s going on in your CD pipeline,\nand the GitHub\nOrganization Folder will automatically scan your GitHub organization for\nrepositories with Pipeline definitions (e.g. Jenkinsfile), and set up jobs for those.\n\nRedesigned job configuration forms :\nThe job configuration form has been redesigned so its structure is visually\nclear when showing complex configuration forms.  Additionally, the tabs on\nthe top of the page show where you are, and can be used to quickly navigate\nbetween the different sections of the configuration form.\n\nDownload now!\n\nGet Jenkins 2.0 alpha 3 now, and tell us what you think:\n\nIf you use Twitter, you can leave us some feedback\non\nTwitter.\n\nOur\njenkinsci-users@\nmailing list is also available for feedback in\nthis\nthread..\n\nAnd of course, since this is a preview release, if you find any issues please\nreport them on our\nIssue Tracker\nto the JENKINS project.\n\nWe have a list of\nknown issues on\nour wiki but if you’re not sure whether you’re experiencing a known issue or\nnot, don’t hesitate to ask!","title":"Jenkins 2.0-alpha-3 Preview Build has been released!","tags":["jenkins2"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and member of the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe was the inaugural Jenkins security officer from 2015 to 2021.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure in his spare time.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"835b1c88-08b7-5106-b8a6-6c102958eea3","slug":"/blog/2016/02/24/jenkins-security-update/","strippedHtml":"We released Jenkins updates today that include important security fixes: 1.650 and 1.642.2.

It will be a developer-focused session where we’ll start off by talking a little about how UI development has traditionally been done in Jenkins, before moving on to some newer patterns and tools that we have been developing over the last few months that let us make use of a wider range of more modern client-side development tools. We’ll also dissect and run some sample plugins that show these newer client-side dev tools in action.\n\nAs usual, the session will start 11am PST.
