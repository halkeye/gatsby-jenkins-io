There are Jenkins plugins for\nSlack,\nHipChat,\nor even email\namong others.\n\nNote: Something is happening!\n\nI think we can all agree getting notified when events occur is preferable to\nhaving to constantly monitor them just in case.  I’m going to continue from\nwhere I left off in my\nprevious post with the\nhermann project.  I added a Jenkins\nPipeline with an HTML publisher for code coverage. This week, I’d like to make\nJenkins to notify me when builds start and when they succeed or fail.\n\nSetup and Configuration\n\nFirst, I select targets for my notifications. For this blog post, I’ll use sample\ntargets that I control.  I’ve created Slack and HipChat organizations called\n\"bitwiseman\", each with one member - me.  And for email I’m running a Ruby SMTP server called\nmailcatcher, that is perfect for local testing\nsuch as this.  Aside for these concessions, configuration would be much the\nsame in a non-demo situation.\n\nNext, I install and add server-wide configuration for the\nSlack,\nHipChat,\nand Email-ext\nplugins.  Slack and HipChat use API tokens - both products have integration\npoints on their side that generate tokens which I copy into my Jenkins\nconfiguration. Mailcatcher SMTP runs locally. I just point Jenkins\nat it.\n\nHere’s what the Jenkins configuration section for each of these looks like:\n\nOriginal Pipeline\n\nNow I can start adding notification steps. The same as\nlast week, I’ll use the\nJenkins Pipeline Snippet Generator\nto explore the step syntax for the notification plugins.\n\nHere’s the base pipeline before I start making changes:\n\nstage 'Build'\n\nnode {\n  // Checkout\n  checkout scm\n\n  // install required bundles\n  sh 'bundle install'\n\n  // build and run tests with coverage\n  sh 'bundle exec rake build spec'\n\n  // Archive the built artifacts\n  archive (includes: 'pkg/*.gem')\n\n  // publish html\n  // snippet generator doesn't include \"target:\"\n  // https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-29711.\n  publishHTML (target: [\n      allowMissing: false,\n      alwaysLinkToLastBuild: false,\n      keepAll: true,\n      reportDir: 'coverage',\n      reportFiles: 'index.html',\n      reportName: \"RCov Report\"\n    ])\n}\n\nThis pipeline expects to be run from a Jenkinsfile in SCM.\nTo copy and paste it directly into a Jenkins Pipeline job, replace the checkout scm step with\ngit 'https://github.com/reiseburo/hermann.git'.\n\nJob Started Notification\n\nFor the first change, I decide to add a \"Job Started\" notification.  The\nsnippet generator and then reformatting makes this straightforward:\n\nnode {\n\n  notifyStarted()\n\n  /* ... existing build steps ... */\n}\n\ndef notifyStarted() {\n  // send to Slack\n  slackSend (color: '#FFFF00', message: \"STARTED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})\")\n\n  // send to HipChat\n  hipchatSend (color: 'YELLOW', notify: true,\n      message: \"STARTED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})\"\n    )\n\n  // send to email\n  emailext (\n      subject: \"STARTED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]'\",\n      body: \"\"\" STARTED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]':\nCheck console output at \" ${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]\"\"\"\",\n      recipientProviders: [[$class: 'DevelopersRecipientProvider']]\n    )\n}\n\nSince Pipeline is a Groovy-based DSL, I can use\nstring interpolation\nand variables to add exactly the details I want in my notification messages. When\nI run this I get the following notifications:\n\nJob Successful Notification\n\nThe next logical choice is to get notifications when a job succeeds.  I’ll\ncopy and paste based on the notifyStarted method for now and do some refactoring\nlater.\n\nnode {\n\n  notifyStarted()\n\n  /* ... existing build steps ... */\n\n  notifySuccessful()\n}\n\ndef notifyStarted() { /* .. */ }\n\ndef notifySuccessful() {\n  slackSend (color: '#00FF00', message: \"SUCCESSFUL: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})\")\n\n  hipchatSend (color: 'GREEN', notify: true,\n      message: \"SUCCESSFUL: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})\"\n    )\n\n  emailext (\n      subject: \"SUCCESSFUL: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]'\",\n      body: \"\"\" SUCCESSFUL: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]':\nCheck console output at \" ${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]\"\"\"\",\n      recipientProviders: [[$class: 'DevelopersRecipientProvider']]\n    )\n}\n\nAgain, I get notifications, as expected.  This build is fast enough,\nsome of them are even on the screen at the same time:\n\nJob Failed Notification\n\nNext I want to add failure notification.  Here’s where we really start to see the power\nand expressiveness of Jenkins pipeline.  A Pipeline is a Groovy script, so as we’d\nexpect in any Groovy script, we can handle errors using try-catch blocks.\n\nnode {\n  try {\n    notifyStarted()\n\n    /* ... existing build steps ... */\n\n    notifySuccessful()\n  } catch (e) {\n    currentBuild.result = \"FAILED\"\n    notifyFailed()\n    throw e\n  }\n}\n\ndef notifyStarted() { /* .. */ }\n\ndef notifySuccessful() { /* .. */ }\n\ndef notifyFailed() {\n  slackSend (color: '#FF0000', message: \"FAILED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})\")\n\n  hipchatSend (color: 'RED', notify: true,\n      message: \"FAILED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})\"\n    )\n\n  emailext (\n      subject: \"FAILED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]'\",\n      body: \"\"\" FAILED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]':\nCheck console output at \" ${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]\"\"\"\",\n      recipientProviders: [[$class: 'DevelopersRecipientProvider']]\n    )\n}\n\nCode Cleanup\n\nLastly, now that I have it all working, I’ll do some refactoring. I’ll unify\nall the notifications in one method and move the final success/failure notification\ninto a finally block.\n\nstage 'Build'\n\nnode {\n  try {\n    notifyBuild('STARTED')\n\n    /* ... existing build steps ... */\n\n  } catch (e) {\n    // If there was an exception thrown, the build failed\n    currentBuild.result = \"FAILED\"\n    throw e\n  } finally {\n    // Success or failure, always send notifications\n    notifyBuild(currentBuild.result)\n  }\n}\n\ndef notifyBuild(String buildStatus = 'STARTED') {\n  // build status of null means successful\n  buildStatus = buildStatus ?: 'SUCCESS'\n\n  // Default values\n  def colorName = 'RED'\n  def colorCode = '#FF0000'\n  def subject = \"${buildStatus}: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]'\"\n  def summary = \"${subject} (${env.BUILD_URL})\"\n  def details = \"\"\" STARTED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]':\nCheck console output at \" ${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]\"\"\"\"\n\n  // Override default values based on build status\n  if (buildStatus == 'STARTED') {\n    color = 'YELLOW'\n    colorCode = '#FFFF00'\n  } else if (buildStatus == 'SUCCESS') {\n    color = 'GREEN'\n    colorCode = '#00FF00'\n  } else {\n    color = 'RED'\n    colorCode = '#FF0000'\n  }\n\n  // Send notifications\n  slackSend (color: colorCode, message: summary)\n\n  hipchatSend (color: color, notify: true, message: summary)\n\n  emailext (\n      subject: subject,\n      body: details,\n      recipientProviders: [[$class: 'DevelopersRecipientProvider']]\n    )\n}\n\nYou have been notified!\n\nI now get notified twice per build on three different channels.  I’m not sure I\nneed to get notified this much for such a short build.  However, for a longer\nor complex CD pipeline, I might want exactly that.  If needed, I could even\nimprove this to handle other status strings and call it as needed throughout\nmy pipeline.\n\nLinks\n\nSlack Plugin\n\nHipChat Plugin\n\nEmail-ext Plugin\n\nJenkins Pipeline Snippet Generator","title":"Sending Notifications in Pipeline","tags":["tutorial","pipeline","plugins","notifications","slack","hipchat","emailext"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#382818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/77b35/lnewman.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/d4a57/lnewman.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/68974/lnewman.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/ef6ff/lnewman.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/8257c/lnewman.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/6766a/lnewman.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/22bfc/lnewman.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/lnewman.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"bitwiseman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Liam started his software career as a tester, which might explain why he&#8217;s such a fan of CI/CD and Pipeline as Code.\nHe has spent the majority of his software engineering career implementing Continuous Integration systems at companies big and small.\nHe is a Jenkins project contributor and an expert in Jenkins Pipeline, both Scripted and Declarative.\nLiam currently works as a Jenkins Evangelist at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>.\nWhen not at work, he enjoys testing gravity by doing Aikido.</p>\n</div>","id":"lnewman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Liam Newman","slug":"/blog/authors/lnewman","twitter":"bitwiseman"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"4848db1b-feac-54a0-8b3e-2a0f5e3fbfc6","slug":"/blog/2016/07/01/html-publisher-plugin/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Liam Newman,\nTechnical Evangelist at CloudBees.\n\nMost projects need more that just JUnit result reporting.  Rather than writing a\ncustom plugin for each type of report, we can use the\nHTML Publisher Plugin.\n\nLet’s Make This Quick\n\nI’ve found a Ruby project,\nhermann, I’d like to build using Jenkins Pipeline. I’d\nalso like to have the code coverage results published with each build job.  I could\nwrite a plugin to publish this data, but I’m in a bit of hurry and\nthe build already creates an HTML report file using SimpleCov\nwhen the unit tests run.\n\nSimple Build\n\nI’m going to use the\nHTML Publisher Plugin\nto add the HTML-formatted code coverage report to my builds.  Here’s a simple\npipeline for building the hermann\nproject.\n\nstage 'Build'\n\nnode {\n  // Checkout\n  checkout scm\n\n  // install required bundles\n  sh 'bundle install'\n\n  // build and run tests with coverage\n  sh 'bundle exec rake build spec'\n\n  // Archive the built artifacts\n  archive (includes: 'pkg/*.gem')\n}\n\nThis pipeline expects to be run from a Jenkinsfile in SCM.\nTo copy and paste it directly into a Jenkins Pipeline job, replace the checkout scm step with\ngit 'https://github.com/reiseburo/hermann.git'.\n\nSimple enough, it builds, runs tests, and archives the package.\n\nNow I just need to add the step to publish the code coverage report.\nI know that rake spec creates an index.html file in the coverage directory.\nI’ve already installed the\nHTML Publisher Plugin.\nHow do I add the HTML publishing step to the pipeline?  The plugin page doesn’t\nsay anything about it.\n\nSnippet Generator to the Rescue\n\nDocumentation is hard to maintain and easy to miss, even more so in a system\nlike Jenkins with hundreds of plugins the each potential have one or more\ngroovy fixtures to add to the Pipeline.  The Pipeline Syntax\"Snippet Generator\" helps users\nnavigate this jungle by providing a way to generate a code snippet for any step using\nprovided inputs.\n\nIt offers a dynamically generated list of steps, based on the installed plugins.\nFrom that list I select the publishHTML step:\n\nThen it shows me a UI similar to the one used in job configuration.  I fill in\nthe fields, click \"generate\", and it shows me snippet of groovy generated from\nthat input.\n\nHTML Published\n\nI can use that snippet directly or as a template for further customization.\nIn this case, I’ll just reformat and copy it in at the end of my\npipeline.  (I ran into a minor bug\nin the snippet generated for this plugin step. Typing\nerror string in my search bar immediately found the bug and a workaround.)\n\n/* ...unchanged... */\n\n  // Archive the built artifacts\n  archive (includes: 'pkg/*.gem')\n\n  // publish html\n  // snippet generator doesn't include \"target:\"\n  // https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-29711.\n  publishHTML (target: [\n      allowMissing: false,\n      alwaysLinkToLastBuild: false,\n      keepAll: true,\n      reportDir: 'coverage',\n      reportFiles: 'index.html',\n      reportName: \"RCov Report\"\n    ])\n\n}\n\nWhen I run this new pipeline I am rewarded with an RCov Report link on left side,\nwhich I can follow to show the HTML report.\n\nI even added the keepAll setting to let I can also go back an look at reports on old jobs as\nmore come in.  As I said to to begin with, this is not as slick as what I\ncould do with a custom plugin, but it is much easier and works with any static\nHTML.\n\nLinks\n\nHTML Publisher Plugin\n\nJenkins Pipeline Snippet Generator","title":"Publishing HTML Reports in Pipeline","tags":["tutorial","pipeline","plugins","ruby"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#382818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/77b35/lnewman.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/d4a57/lnewman.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/68974/lnewman.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/ef6ff/lnewman.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/8257c/lnewman.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/6766a/lnewman.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/22bfc/lnewman.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/lnewman.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"bitwiseman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Liam started his software career as a tester, which might explain why he&#8217;s such a fan of CI/CD and Pipeline as Code.\nHe has spent the majority of his software engineering career implementing Continuous Integration systems at companies big and small.\nHe is a Jenkins project contributor and an expert in Jenkins Pipeline, both Scripted and Declarative.\nLiam currently works as a Jenkins Evangelist at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>.\nWhen not at work, he enjoys testing gravity by doing Aikido.</p>\n</div>","id":"lnewman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Liam Newman","slug":"/blog/authors/lnewman","twitter":"bitwiseman"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9d5b4fb7-1151-5470-985c-045b0dd79455","slug":"/blog/2016/06/16/parallel-test-executor-plugin/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Liam Newman,\nTechnical Evangelist at CloudBees.\n\nIn this blog post, I’ll show you how to speed up your pipeline by using the\nParallel Test Executor Plugin.\n\nSo much to do, so little time…​\n\nIn my career, I’ve helped many teams move to continuous integration and delivery. One problem\nwe always encounter is how to run all the tests needed to ensure high-quality\nchanges while still keeping pipeline times reasonable and changes flowing\nsmoothly. More tests mean greater confidence, but also longer wait times.\nBuild systems may or may not support running tests in parallel, but they still only use one\nmachine even while other lab machines sit idle. In these cases, parallelizing\ntest execution across multiple machines is a great way to speed up pipelines.\nThe Parallel Test Executor plugin lets us leverage Jenkins do just that with no\ndisruption to the rest of the build system.\n\nSerial Test Execution\n\nFor this post, I’ll be running a pipeline based on the\nJenkins Git Plugin. I’ve modified\nthe Jenkinsfile from that project to allow us to compare execution times to our\nlater changes, and I’ve truncated the \"mvn\" utility method since it remains\nunchanged.  You can find the original file\nhere.\n\nnode {\n  stage 'Checkout'\n  checkout scm\n\n  stage 'Build'\n\n  /* Call the Maven build without tests. */\n  mvn \"clean install -DskipTests\"\n\n  stage 'Test'\n  runTests()\n\n  /* Save Results. */\n  stage 'Results'\n\n  /* Archive the build artifacts */\n  archive includes: 'target/*.hpi,target/*.jpi'\n}\n\nvoid runTests(def args) {\n  /* Call the Maven build with tests. */\n  mvn \"install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true\"\n\n  /* Archive the test results */\n  junit '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml'\n}\n\n/* Run Maven */\nvoid mvn(def args) { /* ... */ }\n\nThis pipeline expects to be run from a Jenkinsfile in SCM.\nTo copy and paste it directly into a Jenkins Pipeline job, replace the checkout scm step with\ngit 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin.git'.\n\nThis is a Maven project, so the Jenkinsfile is pretty simple.\nI’ve split the Maven build into separate “Build” and “Test”\nstages. Maven doesn’t support this split very well, it wants to run all\nthe steps of the lifecycle in order every time. So, I have to call Maven twice:\nfirst using the “skipTests” property to do only build steps in the first call,\nand then a second time with out that property to run tests.\n\nOn my quad-core machine, executing this pipeline takes about 13 minutes and 30\nseconds.  Of that time, it takes 13 minutes to run about 2.7 thousand tests in\nserial.\n\nParallel Test Execution\n\nThis looks like an ideal project for parallel test execution: a short build\nfollowed by a large number of serially executed tests that consume the most of\nthe pipeline time. There are a number of things I could try to speed this up.\nFor example, I could modify test harness to look for ways to parallelize\nthe test execution on this single machine. Or I could try speed up the tests\nthemselves. Both of those can be time-consuming and both risk destabilizing the\ntests. I’d need to know more about the project to do it well.\n\nI’ll avoid that risk by using Jenkins and the\nParallel Test Executor Plugin to\nparallelize the tests across multiple nodes instead. This will isolate the tests\nfrom each other, while still giving us speed gains from parallel execution.\n\nThe plugin reads the list of tests from the results archived in the previous execution of this\njob and splits that list into a specified number of sublists. I can then use\nthose sublists to execute the tests in parallel, passing a different sublist to\neach node.\n\nLet’s look at how this changes the pipeline:\n\nnode { /* ...unchanged... */ }\n\nvoid runTests(def args) {\n  /* Request the test groupings.

The change is significant but it is all encapsulated in this one\nmethod in the Jenkinsfile.\n\nGreat (ish) Success!\n\nHere’s the results for the new pipeline with parallel test execution:\n\nThe tests ran almost twice as fast, without changes outside pipeline.  Great!\n\nHowever, I used 4 test executors, so why am I not seeing a 4x? improvement.\nA quick review of the logs shows the problem: A small number of tests are taking up\nto 5 minutes each to complete! This is actually good news. It means that I\nshould be able to see further improvement in pipeline throughput just by refactoring\nthose few long running tests into smaller parts.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile I would like to have seen closer to a 4x improvement to match to number\nof executors, 2x is still perfectly respectable. If I were working on a group of projects\nwith similar pipelines, I’d be completely comfortable reusing these same changes\non my other project and I’d expect to similar improvement without any disruption to\nother tools or processes.\n\nLinks\n\nhttps://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Parallel+Test+Executor+Plugin","title":"Faster Pipelines with the Parallel Test Executor Plugin","tags":["tutorial","pipeline","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#382818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/77b35/lnewman.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/d4a57/lnewman.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/68974/lnewman.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/ef6ff/lnewman.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/8257c/lnewman.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/6766a/lnewman.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/22bfc/lnewman.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/lnewman.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"bitwiseman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Liam started his software career as a tester, which might explain why he&#8217;s such a fan of CI/CD and Pipeline as Code.\nHe has spent the majority of his software engineering career implementing Continuous Integration systems at companies big and small.\nHe is a Jenkins project contributor and an expert in Jenkins Pipeline, both Scripted and Declarative.\nLiam currently works as a Jenkins Evangelist at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>.\nWhen not at work, he enjoys testing gravity by doing Aikido.</p>\n</div>","id":"lnewman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Liam Newman","slug":"/blog/authors/lnewman","twitter":"bitwiseman"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"lnewman","limit":8,"skip":24,"numPages":4,"currentPage":4}},
