Pipeline (or simply Pipeline with a capital P) is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.\nThis allows you to automate the process of getting software from version control through to your users and customers.\n\nPipeline code works beautifully for its intended role of automating build, test, deploy, and administration tasks.\nBut, as it is pressed into more complex roles and unexpected uses, some users have run into snags.\nUsing best practices – and avoiding common mistakes – can help you design a pipeline that is more robust, scalable, and high-performing.\n\nWe see a lot of users making basic mistakes that can sabotage their pipeline.\n(Yes, you can sabotage yourself when you’re creating a pipeline.)\nIn fact, it’s easy to spot someone who is going down this dangerous path – and it’s usually because they don’t understand some key technical concepts about Pipeline.\nThis invariably leads to scalability mistakes that you’ll pay dearly for down the line.\n\nDon’t make this mistake!\n\nPerhaps the biggest misstep people make is deciding that they need to write their entire pipeline in a programming language.\nAfter all, Pipeline is a domain specific language (DSL).\nHowever, that does not mean that it is a general-purpose programming language.\n\nIf you treat the DSL as a general-purpose programming language, you are making a serious architectural blunder by doing the wrong work in the wrong place.\nRemember that the core of Pipeline code runs on the controller.\nSo, you should be mindful that everything you express in the Pipeline domain specific language (DSL) will compete with every other Jenkins job running on the controller.\n\nFor example, it’s easy to include a lot of conditionals, flow control logic, and requests using scripted syntax in the pipeline job.\nExperience tells us this is not a good idea and can result in serious damage to pipeline performance.\nWe’ve actually seen organizations with poorly written Pipeline jobs bring a controller to its knees, while only running a few concurrent builds.\n\nWait a minute, you might ask, “Isn’t handling code what the controller is there for?”\nYes, the controller certainly is there to execute pipelines.\nBut, it’s much better to assign individual steps of the pipeline to command line calls that execute on an agent.\nSo, instead of running a lot of conditionals inside the pipeline DSL, it’s better to put those conditionals inside a shell script or batch file and call that script from the pipeline.\n\nHowever, this raises another question: “What if I don’t have any agents connected to my controller?”\nIf this is the case, then you’ve just made another bad mistake in scaling Jenkins pipelines.\nWhy? Because the first rule of building an effective pipeline is to make sure you use agents.\nIf you’re using a Jenkins controller and haven’t defined any agents, then your first step should be to define at least one agent and use that agent instead of executing on the controller.\n\nFor the sake of maintaining scalability in your pipeline, the general rule is to avoid processing any workload on your controller.\nIf you’re running Jenkins jobs on the controller, you are sacrificing controller performance.\nSo, try to avoid using Jenkins controller capacity for things that should be passed off to an agent.\nThen, as you grow and develop, all of your work should be running agents.\nThis is why we always recommend setting the number of executors on the master to zero.\n\nUse Just Enough Pipeline to Keep Your Pipeline Scalable\n\nAll of this serves to highlight our overarching theme of “using just enough pipeline.”\nSimply put, you want to use enough code to connect the pipeline steps and integrate tools – but no more than that.\nLimit the amount of complex logic embedded in the Pipeline itself (similarly to a shell script), and avoid treating it as a general-purpose programming language.\nThis makes the pipeline easier to maintain, protects against bugs, and reduces the load on controllers.\n\nAnother best practice for keeping your pipeline lean, fast, and scalable is to use declarative syntax instead of scripted syntax for your Pipeline.\nDeclarative naturally leads you away from the kinds of mistakes we’ve just described.\nIt is a simpler expression of code and an easier way to define your job.\nIt’s computed at the startup of the pipeline instead of executing continually during the pipeline.\n\nTherefore, when creating a pipeline, start with declarative, and keep it simple for as long as possible.\nAnytime a script block shows up inside of a declarative pipeline, you should extract that block and put it in a shared library step.\nThat keeps the declarative pipeline clean.\nBy combining declarative with a shared library, that will take care of the vast majority of use cases you’ll encounter.\n\nThat said, it’s not accurate to say that declarative plus a shared library will solve every problem.\nThere are cases where scripted is the right solution.\nHowever, declarative is a great starting point until you discover that you absolutely must use scripted.\n\nJust remember, at the end of the day, you’ll do well to follow the adage: “Use just enough pipeline and no more.”\n\nThanks to our Sponsor\n\nMark and Darin both work

this week the Jenkins infrastructure team identified a successful attack against our deprecated Confluence service.\nWe responded immediately by taking the affected server offline while we investigated the potential impact.\nAt this time we have no reason to believe that any Jenkins releases, plugins, or source code have been affected.\n\nThus far in our investigation, we have learned that the Confluence CVE-2021-26084 exploit was used to install what we believe was a Monero miner in the container running the service.\nFrom there an attacker would not be able to access much of our other infrastructure.\nConfluence did integrate with our integrated identity system which also powers Jira, Artifactory, and numerous other services.\n\nThe trust and security in Jenkins core and plugin releases is our highest priority.\nWe do not have any indication that developer credentials were exfiltrated during the attack.\nAt the moment we cannot assert otherwise and are therefore assuming the worst.\nWe are taking actions to prevent releases at this time until we re-establish a chain of trust with our developer community.\nWe have reset passwords for all accounts in our integrated identity system.\nWe are improving the password reset system as part of this effort.\n\nAt this time, the Jenkins infrastructure team has permanently disabled the Confluence service, rotated privileged credentials, and taken proactive measures to further reduce the scope of access across our infrastructure.\nWe are working closely with our colleagues at the Linux Foundation and the Continuous Delivery Foundation to ensure that infrastructure which is not directly managed by the Jenkins project is also scrutinized.\n\nIn October 2019 we made the Confluence server read-only effectively deprecating it for day-to-day use within the project.\nAt that time, we began migrating documentation and changelogs from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\nThat migration has been ongoing, with hundreds of plugins and many other documentation pages moved from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\n\nWe are grateful for those of you who followed our responsible disclosure procedure and reached out to us about this vulnerability affecting the Jenkins project.\n\nWe will continue to take proactive measures to improve the security of our infrastructure and encourage you to follow us on Twitter for further updates.","title":"Jenkins project Confluence instance

Jenkins project provides Docker images for controllers, inbound agents, outbound agents, and more.\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.307 released August 17, 2021 and Jenkins 2.303.1 released August 25, 2021, the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project will use Java 11 instead of Java 8.\n\nControllers use Java 11 by default\n\nIf you are running one of the Jenkins Docker controller images that does not include a JDK version in its label, the Java runtime will switch from Java 8 to Java 11 with the upgrade.\n\nFor example:\n\nJenkins 2.306 running as jenkins/jenkins:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.307 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:latest, it will use Java 11\n\nJenkins 2.289.3 running as jenkins/jenkins:lts uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.303.1 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:lts, it will use Java 11\n\nThe Docker image tags affected by this upgrade include:\n\nalpine\n\ncentos7\n\nlatest\n\nlts\n\nslim\n\nUsers that need to remain with Java 8 may use a different Docker image tag to run with Java 8.\n\nJenkins 2.306 running as jenkins/jenkins:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.307 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:latest-jdk8, it will use Java 8\n\nJenkins 2.289.3 running as jenkins/jenkins:lts uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.303.1 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk8, it will use Java 8\n\nAgents use Java 11 by default\n\nDuring the next 1-2 weeks (Aug 17, 2021 - Aug 31, 2021), the Jenkins agent images will be updated to use Java 11 instead of Java 8.\n\nFor example:\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.9-1 uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.10-1 it will use Java 11.\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:latest after the agent change, it will use Java 11.\n\nUsers that need to remain with Java 8 may use a different Docker image tag to run with Java 8.\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.9-1 uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.10-1-jdk8 it will also use Java 8.\n\nDocker tag updates stopped\n\nThe Jenkins project will no longer update the Docker images that are based on CentOS 8.\nThe CentOS project has changed direction to track just ahead of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux release rather than tracking after a release.\nThey are no longer publishing updates for CentOS 8 Docker images.\n\nUsers running Jenkins 2.306 or earlier with the jenkins/jenkins:centos tag will need to switch to use a different tag.\nThey may consider using:\n\njenkins/jenkins:almalinux\n\njenkins/jenkins:rhel-ubi8-jdk11\n\nUsers running Jenkins 2.289.3 or earlier with the jenkins/jenkins:centos tag will need to switch to use a different tag\n\nThey may consider using:\n\njenkins/jenkins:lts-almalinux\n\njenkins/jenkins:lts-rhel-ubi8-jdk11\n\nWindow 1809 Docker images stopped\n\nThe Windows Docker images have published versions based on both the 1809 feature release and the Windows Server long term support channel (\"LTSC\").\nWindows support for the 1809 images will no longer be published because Microsoft has ended mainstream support for the 1809 images.\nUsers should switch to use the Jenkins images based on the \"LTSC\" channel.","title":"Docker images use Java 11 by

To understand how to configure credentials in a Jenkins environment: Using Credentials\n\ngitToolName\n\nName of the git installation in the machine running the Jenkins instance\n(Check Global Tool Configuration section in Jenkins UI)\n\nNote: In case a user is not aware of the git tool installation of the particular machine, the default git installation will be chosen.\n\nExamples\n\nThe withCredentials wrapper allows declarative and scripted Pipeline jobs to perform authenticated command line git operations with sh , bat , and powershell tasks.\n\nShell example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  sh 'git fetch --all'\n}\n\nBatch example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  bat 'git submodule update --init --recursive'\n}\n\nPowershell example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  powershell 'git push'\n}\n\nThe Pipeline Syntax Snippet Generator is a good way to explore the syntax of the withCredentials step and the git username / password credentials binding.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe git credentials username / password binding has been tested on command line git versions 1.8.3 through 2.32.0.\nIt has been tested on CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Debian 9, Debian 10, FreeBSD 12, OpenBSD 6.9, openSUSE 15.2, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 21.04, and Windows 10.\nProcessor testing has included amd64, arm32, arm64, and s390x.\n\nThe binding does not support private key credentials.\nThe binding is not supported on command line git versions prior to 1.8.3.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nPrivate key credentials support is coming soon.","title":"Git username / password credentials

are happy to announce that\nthe Jenkins community has moved all its official IRC channels to Libera chat.\nWe have started our migration on May 26 as a response to the\nhostile takeover\nof hundreds of open source community channel by the new Freenode management.\nAs decided  by the Jenkins governance meeting on June 16th,\nLibera Chat IRC channels are the only official channels going forward.\n\nA more detailed history of the transition is available on the Jenkins developers mailing list.\n\nWhat did we move?\n\nWe have created the following IRC chats:\n\nthat currently live on freenode to libera.chat:\n\n#jenkins - general discussion channel for Jenkins users and developers.\nWe no longer consider it a central chat for all things Jenkins, but we intend to keep it available to users\nwho want to keep using IRC.\n\n#jenkins-hosting - Chat used by the Hosting Team to manage hosting automation\n\n#jenkins-infra - Chat used by the Infrastructure Team to coordinate efforts related to Jenkins project infrastructure and the incident response\n\n#jenkins-release - Chat used for Jenkins core release coordination by the Release Team\n\nAll other channels have NOT been moved to Libera Chat IRC and were replaced by other channels.\nMost notable channels:\n\n#jenkins-meeting - the Jenkins Governance Meeting uses combination of Zoom and Google Docs at the moment. We do not longer use the IRC chat for that purpose.\n\n#jenkins-cert - no private chat going forward. The Security Team will use mailing lists only going forward\n\n#jenkins-community - Replaced by the Advocacy&Outreach Gitter channel.\n\nFreenode concerns and disclaimers\n\nGoing forward, the Jenkins community does not have ANY official channels on Freenode.\nAll channels are either removed or left abandoned.\nWe no longer manage or control our channels.\nMost of the Jenkins IRC channel operators use IRCCloud,\nand hence they were banned by the Freenode team on June 11th.\nOnly a few operators have reconnected since this event.\n\nTaking the takeover of Freenode and hostile actions taken by the new management,\nwe can no longer guarantee any of the following:\n\nAuthenticity of registered users on Freenode.\nAll IRC accounts, cloaked or not, might have been taken over by the new Freenode management.\n Do not trust messages from the Jenkins contributor account IDs there.\n\nConfidentiality of private channels like #jenkins-cert.\nWe performed audit of the conversations there, and we believe there are no undisclosed security vulnerabilities referenced in the channel.\n After all, this IRC has been rather dormant for the last 18 months.\n\nIRC User Passwords.\nAll passwords on Freenode IRC may be compromised in the future.\nWe strongly advise all users to rotate their passwords if they were used on Freenode IRC.\n\nWe have made backups of IRC channel conversations in the abandoned channels.\nIf you need to access the conversation history, please reach out to the Jenkins Infrastructure team.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the entire Libera Chat team and all contributors who have worked on creating\na Freenode replacement for hundreds of open source communities using IRC.\nWithin just a month, a new platform has been created and adopted by almost all active projects.\nWe remember the Hudson to Jenkins renaming days when a similar mobilization happened in the Jenkins community,\nand we appreciate all the effort put by contributors.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels\nand our automation like the IRC Bot used by the Jenkins hosting team.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn the Jenkins community we will keep using Libera Chat IRC and maintaining user and contributor channels there.\nOther Jenkins chat channels like Gitter and Slack are unchanged.\nWe intend to gradually replace many of those channels with community.jenkins.io.\nThis is a new portal powered by Discourse.\nThe service is sponsored by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc..\nIt is currently in preview, stay tuned for announcements.\nAs always, we will appreciate any suggestions and feedback!","title":"Jenkins IRC moves to Libera

She Code Africa Contributhon started April 1, 2021.\nThe She Code Africa Contributhon is a boot camp where African women are paid to work with open source organizations on selected projects with dedicated mentors.\nThis program aims to create a more diverse, inclusive, and innovative culture within the African open source ecosystem by matching African women in technology with sponsor and mentor open source organizations.\nThe 5 mentees joining the Jenkins project come from Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda.\n\nThe Jenkins project has been accepted as a Contributhon mentoring organization.\nOur project idea will introduce mentees to Jenkins and plugin development as they create Pipeline examples and create Pipeline help for Jenkins Pipeline plugins.\n\nTwice weekly mentoring sessions are scheduled with the mentees and are listed in the events calendar.\nWe’ve already received the first pull request to improve the embedded documentation that generates the Steps Reference and provides contextual help in the Snippet Generator.\nWe’re looking forward to more pull requests and more improvements throughout April, 2021.\n\nWe’d like to introduce our mentees so that you recognize them and can welcome them during code review and online chat.\n\nOnyinye Ezike\n\nOnyinye is based in Lagos, Nigeria.\nShe’s a junior fullstack software developer who is very passionate about learning.\nShe uses Angular, React, Nodejs, and Spring Boot.\nShe has spent the last two years building up herself in software development and she’s hoping to become a world-class software developer.\n\nYou’ll recognize her contributions as Onyimatics on GitHub and on the Jenkins issue tracker.\n\nSharon Jebitok\n\nSharon is based in Kenya.\nShe’s a software development student at Microverse, a remote school for software developers.\nShe has been an active member of She Code Africa and she’s presently a mentee on She Code Africa’s Contributhon Program with the Jenkins project.\nShe has spent one year in the software industry since she switched her career into tech, learning to write meaningful code and collaborate with other developers/designers and the tech community.\n\nYou’ll recognize her contributions as jebitok-dev on GitHub and as jebitok16_ on the Jenkins issue tracker.\n\nEsther Ejidike\n\nEsther is a frontend developer based in Lagos, Nigeria.\nShe is one of the participants in the She Code Africa Contributhon Open Source Program working with Jenkins and will be contributing to the nodes and processes plugin.\nShe loves to convert

issue tracker.\n\nCynthia Iradukunda\n\nCynthia Iradukunda is based in Kigali, Rwanda.\nShe is currently a junior Computing student at the African Leadership University (ALU) in Mauritius.\nShe wants to be a software engineer because it will help her solve real-world problems while also allowing her to use her coding skills.\nHer coding skills include but not limited to Java, JavaScript, and attention to detail.\nBy contributing to the Git plugin, she hopes to help users have a smooth process using its documentation, get involved with the project, and connect with other community members.\n\nYou’ll recognize her contributions as ciradu2204 on GitHub and as ciradu2204 on the Jenkins issue tracker.\n\nLucy Karimi\n\nLucy is based in Nairobi, Kenya.\nShe is a software developer
