It was an experiment to let\nplugins be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main\nJava Virtual Machine runtime with help of JRuby.\nA similar extension was made to allow plugins to be written in Python but still integrated into the Java Virtual Machine with Jython.\n\nOver the years though, the experiments are no longer being maintained and the\nplugins that use the non-Java runtimes take a lot of compatibility effort.\nIn addition, the Jenkins ruby runtime does not support Java 11.\nSpecifically, the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins\ncore developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and\nprocesses to keep the non-Java runtimes barely working.\nExamples of the experienced issues include compatibility with jep:200[Switch Remoting/XStream blocklist to a permitlist] where we had to allow many Ruby Runtime classes in the Jenkins core to support serialization of data.\n\nIn 2018 we discussed the future of the Ruby Runtime based plugins.\nThere was a consensus that we want to deprecate and remove the plugins so that Jenkins users do not experience issues .\nDaniel Beck created jep:7[Deprecation of ruby-runtime] for that.\nOver the years, the functionality provided by Ruby plugins has been largely replaced by other implementations,\nand hence we have decided to proceed with the deprecation\n( discussion).\n\nOne month from now, January 22nd, 2022, the default Jenkins update center will stop distributing\nthe Ruby runtime plugin, the plugins that use the Ruby runtime, the Python runtime plugin, and the plugin that uses the Python runtime.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nIf you are one of the few users who are using the following plugins, there will be no impact on your existing instances. The\nonly change will come for new installs. Suspended plugins will stay\ninstalled, but can not be newly installed without manually downloading\nreleases or using custom update centers.\n\nJenkins plugin management tools and distributions may be affected as well if they use the default update center to download the plugins and/or their metadata.\nIt includes but is not limited to the official Docker images,\nHelm charts,\nJenkinsfile Runner,\nCustom Jenkins WAR Packager,\nand the Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool.\nNote that all these tools allow custom update sites to be configured if required.\n\nThe lists below provide additional information about the plugins based on the Ruby Runtime and the Python Runtime.\nPlease plan your transition away from these plugins.\nThey will be removed from the official Jenkins update centers on January 22, 2022.\n\nAffected plugins\n\nGitlab Hook\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nContains multiple security vulnerabilties.\nSuggestion: Use the GitLab plugin and the GitLab Branch Source plugin.\n\nCucumber\n\nLast released 9 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run cucumber from the command line.\n\npyenv\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run pyenv from the command line.\n\nRvm\n\nLast released 5 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run rvm from the command line.\n\nCapitomcat\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Install Ruby and

ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run rbenv from the command line.\n\nChef\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run chef from the command line.\n\nCI Skip\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the GitHub Commit Skip SCM Behaviour, Bitbucket Commit Skip SCM Behaviour, or SCM Skip to skip builds based on the content of commit messages.\nAlternately, use sh, bat, or other scripts to read git commit messages and conditionally execute Pipeline steps.\n\nInstallShield\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh, bat, or other scripts to run InstallShield.\n\nMySQL Job Databases\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use Jenkins Job Database Manager Plugin for MySQL.\n\nPathignore\n\nLast released 10 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the

Ruby Runtime based plugins and the Python Runtime based plugin.\nWe also thank those who participated in development of new plugins replacing the functionality.\nThese contributors helped millions of Jenkins users while the ecosystem was supported over the past 10 years\nand it is not taken for granted.\nNow we need to move on so that we can keep expanding the Jenkins architecture and developers tools.\nWe invite all contributors to participate in this effort and to help us to migrate the plugins to supported JVM-based platforms for plugins.\n\nMy instance is affected, what to do next?\n\nIf you do not use the affected plugins, the recommendation is to remove them.\nOtherwise, it is recommended to start migration out of the plugins to alternatives providing similar functionality.\n\nNot all plugins have alternatives.\nAt the moment the Jenkins core team does not plan to provide a replacement, but any contributions are welcome.\nIf you depend on the functionality,\nwe recommend reaching out to the community in the developer mailing list so that\nyou can coordinate the replacement with other affected users.","title":"Deprecating non-Java

critical security vulnerability has been identified in the popular \"Apache Log4j 2\" library.\nThis vulnerability is identified as CVE-2021-44228.\n\nLog4j in Jenkins\n\nThe Jenkins security team has confirmed that Log4j is not used in Jenkins core.\nJenkins plugins may be using Log4j.\nYou can identify whether Log4j is included with any plugin by running the following Groovy script in the Script Console :\n\norg.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup.class.protectionDomain.codeSource\n\nIf this results in the following error, Log4j is not included in any installed and enabled plugin:\n\ngroovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: org for class: Script1\n\nOtherwise, the script output will print one location where Log4j is found, which includes the plugin name in the path.\nThat plugin should be disabled or uninstalled, followed by a Jenkins restart and another script execution until the \"No such property\" error appears.\n\nAffected plugins and their mitigation status are listed in the Jenkins issue tracker.\nSee this Jira Epic for components known to be affected.\n\nLog4j in web application containers\n\nIf you are hosting your Jenkins in a separate web application container like Tomcat, Websphere, or Glassfish, check with the providers of those containers to assess if they are using a vulnerable version of Log4j.\n\nWhen Jenkins runs from the Docker image, a native installer package (deb, rpm, msi), or is invoked with java -jar jenkins.war, it is not running inside a separate web application container.\nIt is using the built-in Jetty web application container that is bundled inside Jenkins and does not include Log4j.\n\nLog4j in Jenkins project infrastructure\n\nThe Jenkins infrastructure team is currently checking all Jenkins project infrastructure for the presence of vulnerable versions of the Log4j library.\nThis work is ongoing.\nWe may decide to disable some services temporarily out of an abundance of caution.\nYou can see the status of services on the status page.","title":"Apache Log4j 2 vulnerability

Gupta,\nAvinash Upadhyaya K R,\nRajan Kumar Singh, and\nDheeraj Singh Jodha provided a total of 29 pull requests migrating plugin documentation to GitHub.\n\nSpecial thanks to the contributors and to the plugin maintainers that merged and released documentation migration pull requests.\nEight plugins have fully migrated their documentation to GitHub through Hacktoberfest contributions.\nAn additional thirteen plugins have merged the documentation change and will complete the migration with their next plugin release.\n\nThe plugin documentation migration was coordinated through a worksheet.\nA tutorial video describing the documentation migration process is also available.\n\nImplementing Content Security Policy\n\nWadeck Follonier provided a tutorial to prepare Jenkins for a broader implementation of Content Security Policy.\nSix contributors provided pull requests to Jenkins core to create separate JavaScript files from JavaScript that was previously implemented inside the Jenkins 'jelly' files.\nMoving JavaScript into separate files prepares Jenkins to implement Content Security Policy protections against JavaScript embedded in HTML.\n\nJenkins Architecture Diagrams\n\nAngélique Jard provided architectural diagrams showing a dataflow view of Jenkins and a high level view of Jenkins.\nThose diagrams help others understand the internal structure of Jenkins and how it interacts with users and with other systems.\n\nModernizing Plugins Video Series\n\nDarin Pope created five videos illustrating some of the small steps that a new contributor can use to help modernize a plugin.\nAdditional plugin modernization and adoption ideas are included in the\"Contributing to Open Source\" workshop from DevOps World 2021.\n\nModernizing Jenkins Plugins\n\nThanks to All\n\nWe offer our most sincere thanks to all Hacktoberfest contributors and to the many pull request reviewers.","title":"Jenkins in Hacktoberfest

Pipeline (or simply Pipeline with a capital P) is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.\nThis allows you to automate the process of getting software from version control through to your users and customers.\n\nPipeline code works beautifully for its intended role of automating build, test, deploy, and administration tasks.\nBut, as it is pressed into more complex roles and unexpected uses, some users have run into snags.\nUsing best practices – and avoiding common mistakes – can help you design a pipeline that is more robust, scalable, and high-performing.\n\nWe see a lot of users making basic mistakes that can sabotage their pipeline.\n(Yes, you can sabotage yourself when you’re creating a pipeline.)\nIn fact, it’s easy to spot someone who is going down this dangerous path – and it’s usually because they don’t understand some key technical concepts about Pipeline.\nThis invariably leads to scalability mistakes that you’ll pay dearly for down the line.\n\nDon’t make this mistake!\n\nPerhaps the biggest misstep people make is deciding that they need to write their entire pipeline in a programming language.\nAfter all, Pipeline is a domain specific language (DSL).\nHowever, that does not mean that it is a general-purpose programming language.\n\nIf you treat the DSL as a general-purpose programming language, you are making a serious architectural blunder by doing the wrong work in the wrong place.\nRemember that the core of Pipeline code runs on the controller.\nSo, you should be mindful that everything you express in the Pipeline domain specific language (DSL) will compete with every other Jenkins job running on the controller.\n\nFor example, it’s easy to include a lot of conditionals, flow control logic, and requests using scripted syntax in the pipeline job.\nExperience tells us this is not a good idea and can result in serious damage to pipeline performance.\nWe’ve actually seen organizations with poorly written Pipeline jobs bring a controller to its knees, while only running a few concurrent builds.\n\nWait a minute, you might ask, “Isn’t handling code what the controller is there for?”\nYes, the controller certainly is there to execute pipelines.\nBut, it’s much better to assign individual steps of the pipeline to command line calls that execute on an agent.\nSo, instead of running a lot of conditionals inside the pipeline DSL, it’s better to put those conditionals inside a shell script or batch file and call that script from the pipeline.\n\nHowever, this raises another question: “What if I don’t have any agents connected to my controller?”\nIf this is the case, then you’ve just made another bad mistake in scaling Jenkins pipelines.\nWhy? Because the first rule of building an effective pipeline is to make sure you use agents.\nIf you’re using a Jenkins controller and haven’t defined any agents, then your first step should be to define at least one agent and use that agent instead of executing on the controller.\n\nFor the sake of maintaining scalability in your pipeline, the general rule is to avoid processing any workload on your controller.\nIf you’re running Jenkins jobs on the controller, you are sacrificing controller performance.\nSo, try to avoid using Jenkins controller capacity for things that should be passed off to an agent.\nThen, as you grow and develop, all of your work should be running agents.\nThis is why we always recommend setting the number of executors on the master to zero.\n\nUse Just Enough Pipeline to Keep Your Pipeline Scalable\n\nAll of this serves to highlight our overarching theme of “using just enough pipeline.”\nSimply put, you want to use enough code to connect the pipeline steps and integrate tools – but no more than that.\nLimit the amount of complex logic embedded in the Pipeline itself (similarly to a shell script), and avoid treating it as a general-purpose programming language.\nThis makes the pipeline easier to maintain, protects against bugs, and reduces the load on controllers.\n\nAnother best practice for keeping your pipeline lean, fast, and scalable is to use declarative syntax instead of scripted syntax for your Pipeline.\nDeclarative naturally leads you away from the kinds of mistakes we’ve just described.\nIt is a simpler expression of code and an easier way to define your job.\nIt’s computed at the startup of the pipeline instead of executing continually during the pipeline.\n\nTherefore, when creating a pipeline, start with declarative, and keep it simple for as long as possible.\nAnytime a script block shows up inside of a declarative pipeline, you should extract that block and put it in a shared library step.\nThat keeps the declarative pipeline clean.\nBy combining declarative with a shared library, that will take care of the vast majority of use cases you’ll encounter.\n\nThat said, it’s not accurate to say that declarative plus a shared library will solve every problem.\nThere are cases where scripted is the right solution.\nHowever, declarative is a great starting point until you discover that you absolutely must use scripted.\n\nJust remember, at the end of the day, you’ll do well to follow the adage: “Use just enough pipeline and no more.”\n\nThanks to our Sponsor\n\nMark and Darin both work

this week the Jenkins infrastructure team identified a successful attack against our deprecated Confluence service.\nWe responded immediately by taking the affected server offline while we investigated the potential impact.\nAt this time we have no reason to believe that any Jenkins releases, plugins, or source code have been affected.\n\nThus far in our investigation, we have learned that the Confluence CVE-2021-26084 exploit was used to install what we believe was a Monero miner in the container running the service.\nFrom there an attacker would not be able to access much of our other infrastructure.\nConfluence did integrate with our integrated identity system which also powers Jira, Artifactory, and numerous other services.\n\nThe trust and security in Jenkins core and plugin releases is our highest priority.\nWe do not have any indication that developer credentials were exfiltrated during the attack.\nAt the moment we cannot assert otherwise and are therefore assuming the worst.\nWe are taking actions to prevent releases at this time until we re-establish a chain of trust with our developer community.\nWe have reset passwords for all accounts in our integrated identity system.\nWe are improving the password reset system as part of this effort.\n\nAt this time, the Jenkins infrastructure team has permanently disabled the Confluence service, rotated privileged credentials, and taken proactive measures to further reduce the scope of access across our infrastructure.\nWe are working closely with our colleagues at the Linux Foundation and the Continuous Delivery Foundation to ensure that infrastructure which is not directly managed by the Jenkins project is also scrutinized.\n\nIn October 2019 we made the Confluence server read-only effectively deprecating it for day-to-day use within the project.\nAt that time, we began migrating documentation and changelogs from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\nThat migration has been ongoing, with hundreds of plugins and many other documentation pages moved from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\n\nWe are grateful for those of you who followed our responsible disclosure procedure and reached out to us about this vulnerability affecting the Jenkins project.\n\nWe will continue to take proactive measures to improve the security of our infrastructure and encourage you to follow us on

Jenkins project provides Docker images for controllers, inbound agents, outbound agents, and more.\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.307 released August 17, 2021 and Jenkins 2.303.1 released August 25, 2021, the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project will use Java 11 instead of Java 8.\n\nControllers use Java 11 by default\n\nIf you are running one of the Jenkins Docker controller images that does not include a JDK version in its label, the Java runtime will switch from Java 8 to Java 11 with the upgrade.\n\nFor example:\n\nJenkins 2.306 running as jenkins/jenkins:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.307 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:latest, it will use Java 11\n\nJenkins 2.289.3 running as jenkins/jenkins:lts uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.303.1 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:lts, it will use Java 11\n\nThe Docker image tags affected by this upgrade include:\n\nalpine\n\ncentos7\n\nlatest\n\nlts\n\nslim\n\nUsers that need to remain with Java 8 may use a different Docker image tag to run with Java 8.\n\nJenkins 2.306 running as jenkins/jenkins:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.307 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:latest-jdk8, it will use Java 8\n\nJenkins 2.289.3 running as jenkins/jenkins:lts uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.303.1 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk8, it will use Java 8\n\nAgents use Java 11 by default\n\nDuring the next 1-2 weeks (Aug 17, 2021 - Aug 31, 2021), the Jenkins agent images will be updated to use Java 11 instead of Java 8.\n\nFor example:\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.9-1 uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.10-1 it will use Java 11.\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:latest after the agent change, it will use Java 11.\n\nUsers that need to remain with Java 8 may use a different Docker image tag to run with Java 8.\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.9-1 uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.10-1-jdk8 it will also use Java 8.\n\nDocker tag updates stopped\n\nThe Jenkins project will no longer update the Docker images that are based on CentOS 8.\nThe CentOS project has changed direction to track just ahead of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux release rather than tracking after a release.\nThey are no longer publishing updates for CentOS 8 Docker images.\n\nUsers running Jenkins 2.306 or earlier with the jenkins/jenkins:centos tag will need to switch to use a different tag.\nThey may consider using:\n\njenkins/jenkins:almalinux\n\njenkins/jenkins:rhel-ubi8-jdk11\n\nUsers running Jenkins 2.289.3 or earlier with the jenkins/jenkins:centos tag will need to switch to use a different tag\n\nThey may consider using:\n\njenkins/jenkins:lts-almalinux\n\njenkins/jenkins:lts-rhel-ubi8-jdk11\n\nWindow 1809 Docker images stopped\n\nThe Windows Docker images have published versions based on both the 1809 feature release and the Windows Server long term support channel (\"LTSC\").\nWindows support for the 1809 images will no longer be published because Microsoft has ended mainstream support for the 1809 images.\nUsers should switch to use the Jenkins images based on the \"LTSC\" channel.","title":"Docker images use Java 11 by

To understand how to configure credentials in a Jenkins environment: Using Credentials\n\ngitToolName\n\nName of the git installation in the machine running the Jenkins instance\n(Check Global Tool Configuration section in Jenkins UI)\n\nNote: In case a user is not aware of the git tool installation of the particular machine, the default git installation will be chosen.\n\nExamples\n\nThe withCredentials wrapper allows declarative and scripted Pipeline jobs to perform authenticated command line git operations with sh , bat , and powershell tasks.\n\nShell example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  sh 'git fetch --all'\n}\n\nBatch example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  bat 'git submodule update --init --recursive'\n}\n\nPowershell example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  powershell 'git push'\n}\n\nThe Pipeline Syntax Snippet Generator is a good way to explore the syntax of the withCredentials step and the git username / password credentials binding.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe git credentials username / password binding has been tested on command line git versions 1.8.3 through 2.32.0.\nIt has been tested on CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Debian 9, Debian 10, FreeBSD 12, OpenBSD 6.9, openSUSE 15.2, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 21.04, and Windows 10.\nProcessor testing has included amd64, arm32, arm64, and s390x.\n\nThe binding does not support private key credentials.\nThe binding is not supported on command line git versions prior to 1.8.3.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nPrivate key credentials support is coming soon.","title":"Git username / password credentials
