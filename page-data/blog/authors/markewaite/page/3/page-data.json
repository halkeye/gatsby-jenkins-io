Done\nW: GPG error: https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ Release:\n    The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:\n        NO_PUBKEY FCEF32E745F2C3D5\nE: The repository 'https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ Release' is not signed.\nN: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by

signing key, the core release automation project has used a new repository signing key.\nThe updated GPG repository signing key is used in the weekly repositories and the stable repositories.\n\nWhich operating systems are affected?\n\nOperating systems that use Debian package management (apt) and operating systems that use Red Hat package management (yum and dnf) need the new repository signing key.\n\nOther operating systems like Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and OpenIndiana are not affected.\n\nAre there other signing changes?\n\nYes, there are other signing changes, though they do not need specific action from users.\n\nThe jenkins.war file is signed with a new code signing certificate.\nThe new code signing certificate has been used on weekly releases since April 2020.","title":"Jenkins 2.235.3: New Linux Repository Signing

is not glamorous, but it is goodness.\n\n— Thomas Otter\n\nJenkins technical documentation is an important part of our project as it is key to using Jenkins well.\nGood documentation guides users and encourages good implementation choices.\nIt is a crucial part of the user experience.\n\nIn the recent Jenkins UI/UX hackfest, documentation was a specific track to improve the Jenkins user experience.\nWe received many improvements from experienced Jenkins contributors and newcomers alike.\nContributors from all around the world submitted pull requests for documentation on installing, managing, administering, and operating Jenkins.\n\nDocumentation migration from Wiki\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki pages have collected 15 years of experience and wisdom for Jenkins users.\nHowever, that experience and wisdom is intermixed with inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated information.\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki migration project identified the 50 most accessed pages on the Jenkins wiki and created GitHub issues to track the migration of those pages to www.jenkins.io.\nThis was our first large scale experiment using GitHub issues for documentation.\nThe results have been overwhelmingly positive.\nHackfest contributors added new sections to many documentation chapters, including:\n\nUsing Jenkins\n\nPipeline\n\nManaging Jenkins\n\nSystem Administration\n\nThe Hackfest closed 19 of the wiki migration issues.\nWork is in progress on an additional 25 wiki migration issues.\nWe’ve made great progress and look forward to even better results in the future.\nNew contributors used the \"good first issue\" label very effectively.\nWe started the Hackfest with most of the 25 \"good first issues\" unassigned and completed the Hackfest with 14 closed and 10 others in progress.\nWe’ll provide more \"good first issues\" as we use the Jenkins Wiki migration to welcome new documentation contributors.\n\nMigrating plugin documentation\n\nPlugin documentation is also in transition.\nSince November 2019, plugins have been moving their documentation into the GitHub repository that hosts the plugin source code.\nThis\"documentation as code\" approach allows plugin maintainers to include documentation improvements in the same pull requests that implement new capabilities.\nIt assures that documentation changes are reviewed by the same maintainers who review and approve new capabilities.\n\nHackfest participants submitted pull requests to migrate plugin documentation to GitHub.\n10 plugin pull requests are in progress from the Hackfest.\n5 plugin pull requests from the Hackfest have been already merged and are awaiting the release of the plugin.\n\nChuck Norris uses documentation as code\n\nIn the spirit of fun and adventure, Oleg Nenashev migrated the \"Chuck Norris plugin\" to GitHub documentation as code in a live Hackfest presentation May 26, 2020.\nLinks to the recording, the plugin migration guide, and the export tool are available from\"Migrating plugins to documentation-as-code\".\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nJenkins works with other technologies to solve automation challenges in many different environments.\nWe describe those environments in our\"Solution Pages\".\nAs part of the Hackfest, we’ve started a series of improvements to the solution pages.\n\nThe Docker solutions page now includes updated videos and a better page layout for easier reading and better navigation.\nOther solution pages will receive similar improvements in the future.\n\nSystem properties\n\nThe global configuration of Jenkins can be modified at startup by defining Java properties.\nSystem properties can change system defaults and can provide compatibility \"escape hatches\" when a new default configuration might be incompatible with existing installations.\n\nDaniel Beck has improved the navigation and user experience of the system properties page as part of the Hackfest.\nIt is now much easier to read and to reference, with embeddable links available with a mouse-over to the right of every property and labels that categorize and classify each property.\n\nPlugin site improvements\n\nDuring the Hackfest, Gavin Mogan has continued his efforts to improve the Jenkins Plugins Site so that users can easily access plugin changelogs and reported issues.\nOnce this pull request is merged, it will greatly improve the experience of those Jenkins users who want to update plugins and look for documentation about what has changed in them and what are the possible issues they might experience.\n\nExample of the incoming UI for the Jira plugin:\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThere is still much to do in Jenkins documentation and we need your help to do it.\nThere are many ways to participate in the Jenkins project, including documentation.\nSee the contributing guidelines for detailed instructions.\nJoin the documentation chat for personalized help and encouragement.\n\nThe Jenkins project has been also accepted to Google Season of Docs this year.\nThis open-source mentorship program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nWe are looking for technical writers who are interested to contribute to the project in September-December 2020.\nIt is a great opportunity to study Documentation-as-code tools and to learn more about contributing to open-source projects.\nYou can find Jenkins project ideas and more information here.","title":"Jenkins User Experience Hackfest Documentation

of the things we loved about going to developer conferences was meeting Jenkins users — newbies and old-timers alike — who are excited to talk about their projects and share tips on how to move forward using Jenkins.\nSince the coronavirus pandemic, we’re learning to rely more on new ways to gather, and it’s happening via Jenkins online meetups, GitHub collaborations, and Twitter threads, to name a few.\n\nIt’s a significant change.\nBut what hasn’t changed is the need to share stories about the things users have built, the solutions they’ve developed, and the excellent results they’re getting from some really innovative Jenkins implementations.\nThen we wondered, why isn’t anyone collecting these user stories and sharing them with the Jenkins community.\n\nIntroducing Jenkins is the Way\n\nSo we took the first step to record and archive all the great stuff everyone in our community is building with Jenkins.\nThis way, Jenkins users old and new can come to an archive and search for Jenkins solutions for inspiration.\nWe foresee a vast library of solutions from all around the world, solving a wide array of challenges in every industry imaginable.\nWe decided to call this archive \" Jenkins Is The Way\" and host it at https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io.\n\nTo aggregate all these stories, we built a simple online questionnaire so that Jenkins users can submit their own experience using this leading open source automation server.\nWith so many plugins to support building, deploying, and automating your projects, we expect to see a vast collection of stories.\n\nWe’ve already received a handful, including stories that illustrate how Jenkins Is The Way :\n\nto code your own release pipelines\n\nto cast magic of continuous delivery\n\nto understand and simplify your software lifecycle\n\nto accelerate automation in the cloud\n\nto facilitate day-to-day work\n\nAdd your story. Show your Jenkins pride. Get our T-shirt\n\nBe an inspiration to the Jenkins community by sharing your Jenkins story.\nJust go to this link and fill out the form.\nWe’ll ask you about your project’s goals, the technical challenges you overcame with Jenkins, and the solutions you created.\nIt should take no more than 20-30 minutes to complete.\n\nWe’ll clean it up for clarity and publish it on https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io.\n\nOnce it’s part of our archive, we’ll send you our new 2020 Jenkins Is the Way t-shirt.\n\nAnd since the more, the merrier, please share this blog post with peers and colleagues.\nWe want to hear everyone’s stories about the clever ways Jenkins is used to automate all that we need to do.\n\nThanks and Acknowledgement\n\nSpecial thanks to abConsulting for creating and managing the https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io site and for reviewing, editing, and publishing the submitted stories.\n\nThanks to the Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG for their reviews and

is a guest post by Mark Waite, who maintains\nthe git plugin,\nthe git client plugin,\nand is a technical evangelist for CloudBees, Inc.\n\nThe Jenkins project booth at Jenkins World 2017\nwill include the \"Pull Requests Corner\", recruiting new Jenkins contributors.\nWe think there are many people who will attend the conference without realizing how easy it is\nto help the Jenkins project, and how much the help is appreciated.\n\nMeet us in the \"Pull Requests Corner\" and we’ll help you find a way to help Jenkins.\nHere are some areas where we can use your help.\nMost of them do not require coding, and do not require a large time commitment.\n\nOne Minute Feedback on Your Version\n\nThe Jenkins changelog pages ( LTS and weekly) gather user experiences with specific Jenkins versions.\nYou can help other Jenkins users by clicking one of the weather icons in the LTS changelog (or the weekly changelog) for the release you’re using.\nChangelog feedback from weekly releases helps the release team select the long term support version.\nChangelog feedback from LTS releases helps other users prepare to upgrade.\n\nIt takes less than a minute, and helps the community (which will ultimately help you).\n\nFive Minutes to Answer a Question\n\nIn five minutes or less, you can help other Jenkins users.\n\nFor example:\n\nAnswer a question on the #jenkins channel of internet relay chat (IRC)\n\nAnswer a question on the Jenkins users mailing list\n\nAnswer a question on stackoverflow jenkins, jenkins plugins, or jenkins pipeline\n\nAnswer a question on reddit\n\nTen Minutes to Learn and Share\n\nIf you have ten minutes, you can learn something new and share what you learned.\n\nRead a Jenkins community blog post and tweet it with the hashtag #jenkinsci\n\nRead a devops.com blog post and share it on LinkedIn\n\nRead a CloudBees blog post and test drive an idea from it\n\nFind another Jenkins blog and share it (I recently discovered Matt Bajor’s ci/cd life blog)\n\nFifteen Minutes for Pipeline\n\nLiam Newman has created the \" Jenkins Minute\" video series.\nThey are brief video segments focusing on specific Jenkins functionality.\nChoose a video, watch it, and share what you learned on social media.\n\nTwenty Minutes for a Bug\n\nThe Jenkins bug tracker contains thousands of bugs.\nReviewing, duplicating, and clarifying bug reports takes time.\nWhen maintainers are reviewing, duplicating, and clarifying bug reports, they are not fixing bugs, and they are not adding new capabilities.\n\nYou can help maintainers by reviewing and duplicating a bug report that matters to you.\nA comment on a bug report is especially helpful when it confirms you’ve been able to duplicate the bug.\nIt is even more helpful if your verification includes the steps you took and how they differ from the original report.\n\nA bug report which has been duplicated, and includes clear instructions, is much more likely to receive maintainer attention.\nHelp yourself and others by duplicating bugs that matter to you.\n\nThirty Minutes for Documentation\n\nThe Jenkins documentation includes\nuser documentation ( guided tour and handbook) and\ndeveloper documentation ( tutorial, how-to guides, and reference).\nYou can help the documentation by describing something important to you clearly and completely.\n\nRefer to the instructions for documentation contributors to see how easy it is to help.\n\nForty Five Minutes for Translation\n\nIf English is not your native language, you can help with Jenkins localization.\nJenkins is used worldwide, and many users will benefit from translations.\nConsidering the rapid and continuing evolution of Jenkins, it is no surprise that there is plenty to translate.\nRefer to the internationalization guide for instructions to help you contribute translations.\n\nSixty Minutes for a Meetup\n\nLocal groups around the world meet often for Jenkins presentations, discussions, and demonstrations.\nOrganizing a Jenkins Area Meetup will introduce you to other users, and will let you explore new ways to benefit from Jenkins.\nThe team at jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com is ready to support your JAM with stickers, t-shirts, and more.\n\nWeek or More - Adopt a Plugin\n\nThe Jenkins plugin ecosystem covers a wide range of areas.\nJenkins plugin maintainers come from many different backgrounds, with many different interests.\nOften, a plugin maintainer may find that they want to do something different on the project, or they may leave the project.\nWhen a plugin maintainer is no longer able to maintain a plugin, they can place it for adoption.\n\nPlugins placed for adoption range from very specific use cases (node stalker plugin) to very general use cases (Subversion plugin).\n\nMaintaining an orphan plugin is a great way to contribute to the project.\nFollow the instructions to \" Adopt a Plugin\".\n\nSee You There!\n\nAll those techniques (and more) are available on the Jenkins participate page.\n\nLook for the \"Jenkins Needs You\" poster at Jenkins World, and come talk\nto us about the ways you can learn new things, address your concerns,\nand help Jenkins.\n\nJoin the Jenkins project at\nJenkins World on August 30-31,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Jenkins Needs You - Pull Request Corner at Jenkins World
