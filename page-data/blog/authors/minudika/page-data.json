Therefore it’s possible to have a bunch of them over the entire lifetime after the plugin installing the plugin.\n\nOn demand bundles: These bundles are generated from the root \"Support\" action.\n\nHowever current support-core plugin is not much user friendly. The object of this project is to make it more user friendly by adding some features which make a sophisticated environment for the user who use support plugin.\n\nIn this project scope, there are three features and improvements we are going to consider.\n\nEase the bundles management by the administrator ( JENKINS-33090)\n\nAdding an option to anonymize customer labels (strings created by the user such as name of a job, folder, view, agent, and template etc). ( JENKINS-33091)\n\nAllowing user to create an issue and submit a bundle into the OSS tracker using the support-core plugin. ( JENKINS-21670)\n\nArnaud Héritier and Steven Christou are guiding me through the project as my mentors.\n\nTasks and Deliverables\n\nEase the bundles management by the administrator.\n\nUnder this task, the following functions are going to be implemented.\n\nListing bundles stored on the jenkins instance with their details.\n\nAllowing user to download each bundle.\n\nAllowing user to delete each bundle or all bundles.\n\nAllowing user to browse the content of each bundle.\n\nAutomatically purging old bundles.\n\nEnabling user to create an issue and submit a bundle into the OSS tracker\n\nWhen a Jenkins user sees an issue, he/she commonly contacts his support contacts (Jenkins instance admins) and then Jenkins admins troubleshoot the issue.\nThe objective of this task is to implement a feature which enables the user to report an issue to a admin through support core plugin.\n\nWhen creating bundles to attach with the ticket, it is important to protect the privacy of the user who creates the ticket. When considering doing that, anonymizing user created labels (texts) comes to the front.\n\nAdding  an option to anonymize customer labels\n\nThe following functions will be implemented under this taks.\n\nCreating randomized tokens for labels created by users.\n\nProducing a mapping for those labels.\n\nSubstituting encoded labels into all the files included in the support bundle.\n\nWhen creating randomized tokens, it would be much useful and effective if we can create those tokens in a way they make sense to humans. (i.e. readable to humans). For that, I am hoping to use a suitable java library to create human friendly random tokens. One of such libraries is wordnet-random-name.\n\nHowever in order to substitute randomized tokens, all files included in the bundle should be read. This can become inefficient when bundle consists of large number of files.  Therefore it’s important to follow an optimized method for this task.\n\nReferences\n\nInitial proposal of the project\n\nProject repository","title":"GSoC Project Intro: Support Core Plugin Improvements","tags":["core","gsoc","plugin","support-core"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"minudika","html":"","id":"minudika","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Minudika Malshan","slug":"/blog/authors/minudika/","twitter":"minudika"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"minudika","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
