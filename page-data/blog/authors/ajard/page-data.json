Fond of agility, I‚Äôm part of the organization committee of the Agile Tour Bordeaux since 2020.\n\nI also like to engage in sporting challenges: I swam across the Garonne (a big river in the south of France) and finished 2 triathlons.\nKeeping the best for the end: I‚Äôm the mother of two kids who taught me it‚Äôs possible to speak about Pokemon with one, while drawing a unicorn with the other.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nDuring my studies, I met quite a lot of ‚Äúnerds / geeks‚Äù contributing to Linux distributions (Gentoo & Debian).\nTheir technical skills seemed higher than mine and the Open Source universe looked inaccessible to me.\nConcerning Jenkins, I am a user (now contributor) of it, but not an administrator.\n\nWhat motivated you to participate in that hackathon?\n\nI dared to participate thanks to the Duchess (and mainly Ang√©lique, thanks to her).\nHaving the support and backing of the community was my motivation.\n\nWhat will you remember from this experience?\n\nFrom a professional point of view, I perfected my knowledge of Git, and I had a chance to overview part of the quality processes from Open Source projects.\nMy first Pull Request was approved by‚Ä¶ 9 people!\nThe fourth reviewer did find an issue.\nWho can tell me code review isn‚Äôt useful now?\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I remember two things.\nThe first one: Open Source communities are not elitist communities.\nEvery contribution matters, even small ones.\nThe people I met were positive and benevolent.\nThe second one could be illustrated by a quote from Grace Hopper: ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a good idea, go ahead and do it. It‚Äôs much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.‚Äù.\n\nDo you have anything more to say?\n\nAfter Jenkins, I also submitted Pull Requests to others Open Source projects.\nThe problem: with such a diversity of Open Source projects, how to organize your time?\n\nAnne-Laure Gaillard contributions during hacktoberfest\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5779\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5785\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5804\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5806\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5807\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5808\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5822\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5823\n\nhttps://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/pull/25\n\nhttps://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/pull/23\n\nhttps://github.com/sarequl/Netflix-Helper/pull/6\n\nBertha Torres Interview\n\nTwitter: @tatoberres\n\nLinkedIn\n\nHello Bertha, can you introduce yourself?\n\nComing from a literature training and as a language teacher for more than 15 years, it‚Äôs while moving to a high mountain area that a need to explore other skills set in.\n\nThus, a self-taught training followed by a validated file for financing diploma training followed one another and confirmed to me that life is too short to waste it on what does not make sense to us.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nParticipating in Open Source appeared to me in that exploratory process like a learning opportunity‚Ä¶\nwhich I thought was inaccessible of course! I didn‚Äôt see myself writing code.\n\nBut thanks to the Duchess France community, I learned how to contribute at my level and to understand the contribution process.\nIt‚Äôll allow me as things progress to contribute in more domains.\n\nCan you tell us how the woman version of Jenkins was born?\n\nWell‚Ä¶ In the presentation video for Hacktoberfest, the artwork was mentioned ( https://www.jenkins.io/artwork/) and Ang√©lique also mentioned it during the first meeting‚Ä¶\nAnd one must admit that looking at it, you can see a lot of different things but women.\n\nSo I imagined a governess, very confident, efficient, very clever, scrupulously combed, nicely dressed, who might represent the personality of what Jenkins is made of.\n\nDo you have anything to add?\n\nThis time I was able to participate through Pull Requests related to translation and drawing. I‚Äôll probably do it again!\n\nBertha Torres contributions during hacktoberfest\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/4627\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5796\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5797\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/214\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/215\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ant-plugin/pull/78\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ant-plugin/pull/77\n\nPauline Iogna‚Äôs Interview\n\nTwitter: @pauline_io\n\nHello Pauline, can you introduce yourself?\n\nI‚Äôm a backend developer in Java/Scala, and an active member of Duchess France.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nI didn‚Äôt really have an opinion about Jenkins before doing the hackathon.\nLike many other people, I‚Äôm a Jenkins user but I didn‚Äôt know its source code.\n\nWhat motivated you to participate in this hackathon?\n\nActually participating in Hacktoberfest.\nJust bringing a contribution, even modest, on an open source project.\n\nWhat did you discover through that hackathon?\n\nTechnically, I discovered how to do MVC with Apache Jelly.\nI also rediscovered the contribution process of Open Source projects.\n\nThe Hacktoberfest mechanism is really well thought out for onboarding people wanting to start working on Open Source projects.\nWith Ang√©lique‚Äôs help on top of that to animate sessions on the Duchess France Slack channel, we had the best conditions to contribute to that important project.\n\nWhat will you remember from this experience?\n\nIt‚Äôs not that simple to contribute to a project you‚Äôre just discovering, it requires a bit of investment and patience.\nOn Jenkins, the contributors are really reactive and the Pull Requests are quickly reviewed.\nThe feedback is useful and benevolent.\nThere is one Jira project listing all the features and bugs to be worked on for the project.\nSome tickets are flagged as ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù allowing those who are beginners to pick easily and quickly doable tickets.\n\nPauline Iogna contributions\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5835\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5793\n\nA few words about the organization within Duchess France\n\nThe framework was intentionally simple and flexible. We started with an online kick start meeting for describing a bit of context, and more precisely the Jenkins universe.\n\nOnline kick start meeting for context\n\nThen, we mainly exchanged through the Duchess Slack channel in an asynchronous way on a dedicated channel, as well as a 30 minutes meeting each Friday during October.","title":"Interview of Duchess contributors for hacktoberfest 2021 on Jenkins","tags":["jenkins","hacktoberfest","developer","newcomer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/19e71/ajard.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/77b35/ajard.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/d4a57/ajard.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/19e71/ajard.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/68974/ajard.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/ef6ff/ajard.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/8257c/ajard.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/6766a/ajard.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/22bfc/ajard.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"aHenryJard","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Ang√©lique is a software developer since 2006, Jenkins user since ever and plugins developer since 2019.
