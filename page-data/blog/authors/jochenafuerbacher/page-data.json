A new solution was needed to detect pipeline changes and show these changes in Jenkins.\nSo we developed Pipeline Configuration History.\n\nDuring every pipeline run the Jenkinsfile and related shared libraries are saved in the builds directory of the job.\nPipeline Configuration History saves changes of the pipeline files between the last run and the previous run as history events.\nTherefore when a pipeline job ceases to build successfully, you can check if something has changed on any used pipeline file.\nYou can also see the build where changes occurred.\n\nBecause a pipeline configuration can consist of several files where changes could have occurred, only files with changes between two builds are shown in the diff.\nThat makes the whole thing more compact and effective:\n\nBut sometimes you may want to show more than the differences between pipeline files.  You may want to see which pipeline files are in use or the content of those files when they were used.\nSo it’s possible to view all files and their content.\nIf required you can download them as well:\n\nConclusion\n\nWe use Pipeline Configuration History successfully in production. It has helped us from the very first day as we solved problems that occurred due to pipeline configuration changes.\nPipeline Configuration History won’t replace Job Configuration History.\nThe plugins have different use cases.\nMany times small changes on job or pipeline configurations also have big impacts.\nBecause of the correlation in time between changes of job or pipeline configurations and different build behavior, it is now possible to substantially reduce the time and effort to analyze build failures.\nThe Job Configuration History and Pipeline Configuration History plugins let us help our users in consulting and in solving issues.  We resolve problems much faster through easy access to the configuration history of jobs.  These plugins are essential for our daily work.","title":"Introducing the Pipeline Configuration History Plugin","tags":["pipeline","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"Jochen-A-Fuerbacher","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jochen is a software developer for development infrastructure at 1&amp;1 Telecommunication.\nHe has been working with Jenkins for many years and develops some Jenkins plugins.</p>\n</div>","id":"jochenafuerbacher","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Jochen A.
