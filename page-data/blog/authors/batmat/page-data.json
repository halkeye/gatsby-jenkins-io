We ended up having 25.\nWe considered having more people, but finally decided that for a first time it would be better to start not too big.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nInfrastructure was sponsored by DigitalOcean.\n\nFor each attendee, we provisioned :\n\nOne Controller, preconfigured to be able to dynamically provision agents.\n\nOne staging environment\n\nOne production environment\n[ 1 ]\n\nOne SonarQube instance\n\nWorkshop content & infrastructure\n\nAfter an initial quick presentation to settle context and remind some general things about Continuous Delivery and Jenkins, we started the workshop per se.\n\nIt is composed of 3 parts, which are readable here [ 2 ], but very few people were able to start the part 3.\n\nHackergarten / Unconference\n\nSo we let people decide what they wanted to work on during the afternoon.\n\nWe decided to use post-its: each attendee would write down what they wanted to work on, one idea per post-it (max 2 per person).\nThen, we dropped those onto a white-board and tried grouping those by theme.\n\nIn the end, overall, the following themes went out:\n\nHack on Jenkins development & Contribute to Jenkins\n\nComplete the workshops\n\nWork on use-case oriented things\n\nWork on Docker & Pipeline join usages\n\nHackergarten\n\nMany Jenkins accounts were created, and many JIRA and pull requests were filed.\nIt was nice to see people asking questions like: \"so, should I create a JIRA issue for this?\" or \"how do I interact with people\".\nPretty generic \"how do I work on open source software\" questions sometimes, but important because you felt like people were genuinely interested and needed not much to start contributing.\n\nHere are the pull requests filed during this afternoon:\n\nblueocean-pipeline-editor-plugin#30\n\njenkins#2785\n\njenkins#2786\n\njenkins#2787\n\njenkins#2788\n\nYou can see that though most of the PRs were typo-related, the one that got merged first was the one about code :-).\n\nSo, Jeremie Violas wins the Bobble Head as promised!\n\nWhy so many typo-related PRs?\n\nSimply because people were somehow encouraged to find some to get used to the\nround trip of: fixing an issue and filing the associated pull request, rinse &\nrepeat.\n\nI do think this is also a pretty nice and simple first step to understand how\nto build Jenkins and start interacting with the community.\n\nThe result\n\nPeople seemed pretty happy and we got some nice comments like \"now I have a clearer vision of what this Pipeline thing is about\".\nSome attendees also dropped nice comments on the meetup page.\nSo it’s cool because when you’re doing such things on your free time, it’s the main reward you can get.\n\nIf you’re an attendee to such events, don’t forget to thank people organizing\nthose, and more importantly to provide constructive feedback.  We are generally\neager to know what could be done better for next time.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall we are very happy with the energy of that day, and we definitely plan to set up a new session in the next few months, probably with a bit more people.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\nInfrastructure: when you plan to have many VM per attendee, double-check the limits your Cloud Provider may have by default. I had bumped it to 250 the day before the workshop, and asked for another one to 500 during the workshop (though in the end, 250 was probably enough, but this’ll give room for the next time with more people :-)).\n\nLogistics: warning, secret ahead: this is very time consuming.\nNot necessarily the amount of work itself, more that it implies very big latency.\nFor instance, give it 2 to 3 weeks minimum to have answers about sponsoring in general. Pinging again in case of no answer after 2 days would probably be seen as rude, and possibly lead to make things worse for obvious reasons, so plan ahead.\n\nThank you\n\nDigitalOcean for sponsoring the Infrastructure\n\nWe got way more than 100 VMs running at the same time during the day thanks to their help!\n\nHarryCow Coworking for hosting the event\n\nTo CloudBees for sponsoring the food for all the participants\n\nAlso for providing a bunch of goodies: stickers and T-Shirts for everybody\n\nGitHub for providing stickers\n\n1. For the sake of the simplicity of the workshop, those environments were actually a single VM: the goal was here to illustrate what we could do using Jenkins Pipeline, discussing scalability or more involved deployment techniques was obviously out of scope.\n\n2. in French only for now, but translating it into English to make it possibly shared and reusable among JAMs is being discussed","title":"Pipeline Workshop & Hackergarten @ ToulouseJAM Feedback","tags":["hackergarten","jam","meetup","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8e8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/ede19/batmat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/bc20c/batmat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/b691b/batmat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/8ba60/batmat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/a9ea7/batmat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/51559/batmat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/28f98/batmat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":130}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/batmat.jpg"},"blog":"http://batmat.net","github":"batmat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Baptiste has been using and contributing to Jenkins since it was called differently, and is a huge proponent of the Agile, Devops &amp;

Note that this represents by no mean the general position of the Jenkins governance board. This is solely my opinion as a contributor based on the data I gathered, and what I feel from the feedback of the community at large.\n\nJava 8 now the most used version, and growing\n\nIf we look at the global numbers, Java 8 runtimes now represent 52.8% of the Jenkins instances running, which have not opted out of anonymous usage statistics.\n\nAnd if you look at the trend, Java 8 is clearly growing fast.\n\nZooming into the Jenkins 2.x instances subset\n\nNow, if you look at that picture, though already interesting and showing a clear trend towards Java 8 runtime adoption, some might argue it’s being too nice to older JREs.\nThe reasoning could be: instances running (very) old Jenkins versions may not be the ones you want to look at when trying to plan the future of an opensource project:\nthose are indeed probably not going to upgrade in general anyway, or when they do, upgrading the JRE would be a small thing compared to the rest to be tested with such a gap.\n\nSo, if we only keep the instances running Jenkins 2.x, then the proportion of Java 8 goes to almost 70% compared to Java 7 (Jenkins 2.x requires Java 7)\n[ 1 ] :\n\nConclusion\n\nJava 8 adoption numbers are getting bigger, while every other JREs are going down.\n\nIf you are still using a JRE 7 to run Jenkins, it is seriously time to think\nabout upgrading to 8.  Knowing that it’s definitely not a bleeding-edge path\nmight help you go that way, especially if you generally do not like upgrades.\nAlso, as a reminder, the most used JDK,\nOracle JDK 7 now got end-of-lifed more than 18 months ago.\n\nContrary to the past attempts the previous years, the discussion on the Jenkins\ndevelopment mailing list did not trigger strong rebutals by many people.\n\nPerhaps it’s finally time for Mr. Jenkins to upgrade to Java 8!\n\nAll numbers shown below are derived from the new jvms.json file now generated automatically every month, after the two related pull-requests 1 and 2 got merged.\n[ 2 ]\n\n1. 69% for October, 67% in September\n\n2.
