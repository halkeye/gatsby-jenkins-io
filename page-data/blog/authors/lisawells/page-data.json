We are all very passionate about automation, infrastructure-as-code, configuration management and of course… Jenkins. +\n +\nMy team and I specialize in implementing continuous delivery for large scale transformation deliveries. We work with a wide range of technologies from open source, packaged products, through to software-as-a-service. We work with physical infrastructure, private cloud, public cloud and platforms-as-a-service, but there is one almost uniquely common factor… using Jenkins. +\n +\nAt the conference I will be expecting to exchange views with others using Jenkins at similar scale and am particularly interested in https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#JosefFuchshuber[sessions] covering using Jenkins with Docker and making Jenkins https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#HarpreetSingh[more resilient]. +\n +\nI am also looking forward to presenting https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#MarkRendell[this lightening talk] where I will be demoing ways in which we’ve extended Jenkins to implement complex integrated pipelines for large-scale software implementations. https://markosrendell.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/reducing-continuous-delivery-impedance-part-2-solution-complexity/[See here] for a sneak preview.","title":"JUC Europe Sneak Peak: Integrated Pipelines","tags":["general","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"lisawells","html":"","id":"lisawells","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Lisa Wells","slug":"/blog/authors/lisawells","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"196c82e5-5f26-5236-8114-8bb2c9f08efc","slug":"/blog/2014/06/11/juc-speaker-sneakpeak-a-build-ecosystem-for-loosely-compiled-code/","strippedHtml":"+\n\n+\nhttps://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/speakers#ForestHandford[ +\n +\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/Forest_Handford_0.preview.jpg[image,width=240,height=320] +\n +\n] +\n\n+\n +\n_We're getting excited about the Boston and Berlin JUC's in the next two weeks!

Like the East Coast conference, the Berlin one is almost full, so sign up while you can.\n\nOur venue in Berlin is KOSMOS, a building with a fascinating history. The building was inaugurated as a cinema in 1961. With 1001 seats, it was the largest, most modern and most popular film theatre in the former GDR and has since been extensively modernized in line with the requirements of historically listed buildings.\n\nWe have an excellent line-up of speakers filling up two conference tracks.\n\nOnce again, we have some fabulous sponsors to thank. Without them, there would be no JUC.\n\nThis year we’ve introduced a new Community sponsorship level, which allows non-corporate groups like JUGSs to help support the conference as well. (Drop a note to juc-oc-ext AT cloudbees DOT com if your group is interested).\n\nWe are very grateful to all of our sponsors – thank you! Hopefully see everyone at JUC.\n\nPS – if you are coming to Berlin for JUC, check out the CD Summit on June 24 at the same venue. There’s also one on June 19 in NYC. The summit will focus on how continuous integration with Jenkins streamlines processes and automates testing and deployment, providing the foundation you need for continuous delivery.","title":"Two Weeks Till Jenkins User Conference Berlin","tags":["general","meetup","news","jenkinsci","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"lisawells","html":"","id":"lisawells","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Lisa Wells","slug":"/blog/authors/lisawells","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9dfcdd00-24d6-5a91-b965-88e536161260","slug":"/blog/2014/03/21/call-for-sponsors-2014-jenkins-user-conferences/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins User Conference (JUC) season is upon us!
