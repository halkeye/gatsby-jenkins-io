We had a number of\nexcellent events hosted around the world this November with plenty of great\nstories and presentations shared by the various members of the world-wide\nJenkins community.\n\nMelbourne, Australia JAM\n\nMelbourne JAM leaders,\nRaisa\nand\nBhuva\nhosted Blue Ocean for the inaugural meeting. Attendees learned the values of\nBlue Ocean, a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modeling\nand presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information that\nis important to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still\nstaying true to the extensibility that Jenkins always has had as a core value.\nThank you James Dumay for stopping by to take part in\nthe inauguration.\n\nSingapore, Singapore JAM\n\nOne of the members  who had several years of experience using Jenkins (since\nHudson days in fact) to present some basics on Continuous Integration with\nGitHub. It was targeted at new members who are starting out with Jenkins. We\nunderstand that we cannot always serve advanced topics to cater to the\nexperienced users and neglect the newbies so this session was targeted to help\ngive new users an introduction to Jenkins. It went well with about 15-20\nattendees and we hope to run some hands-on workshops in 2017. Some members were\nlooking forward to freebies like stickers and T-shirts too!\n\nMoscow, Russia JAM\n\nMoscow JAM leaders,\nKirill Tolkachev\nand\nOleg Nenashev\nled the inaugural meeting with\na packed full agenda. Oleg began the meeting with an update on Jenkins 2 what improvements users can expect and what\nenhancements are in the works within the Jenkins project. Following Oleg, Kirill shared\nhow his team in Alfa Laboratory used Jenkins to improve CD/DevOps in their\nprojects (with Jenkins Pipeline, Job DSL and\nBlue Ocean), the problems they experienced and how they fixed them. Then Oleg talked\nabout Jenkins Pipeline internals, main features and recent changes in the\necosystem. It was followed up by a discussion of large-scale Jenkins instances\nat the after-party.\n\nThe recording of the event can be found\non YouTube.\n\nMilan, Italy JAM\n\nThe first meetup was a great opportunity to meet local Jenkins fans to learn\nand share Jenkins experiences at a local cafe.\n\nSan Francisco, California JAM\n\nR. Tyler Croy\nperformed a 30 minutes live Pipeline coding demo to a relatively novice\naudience (though all had used Jenkins). A good amount of questions from the\naudience  which conveyed an appetite for the content being presented.\nRyan Wallner,\npresenter from ClusterHQ, also gave a demo based around Pipeline talking about\nClusterHQ’s \"Fli\" integration with a delivery pipeline.\n\nWashington, DC JAM\n\nThere was a fantastic 90% showup rate at this month’s meetup - 58 RSVPs and 52\nin attendance was pretty impressive. All this may be due to Fannie Mae’s story\n- the success of how they used Jenkins for CI/CD as part of their DevOps\nadoption. Afterwards, there was a lot of interests and further discussions\ntaking place. Next month’s host will be Freddie Mac.\n\nSeattle, Washington JAM\n\nLong time Jenkins community member and Seattle JAM leader,\nKhai Do showed how OpenStack uses \"Jenkins Job\nBuilder\" to manage and run thousands of Jenkins jobs per day in their\nmulti-controller CI/CD system.  He also compared\nJenkins Job Builder\nwith other Jenkins \"Infrastructure-as-code\" technologies - Jenkins Pipeline and\nJenkins JobDSL. It was followed by an in-depth Q&A and discussion session.\n\nDallas/Forth Worth, Texas (DFW) JAM\n\nThe November DFW JAM was the most strongly attended of the year! DFW JAM leader,\nEric Smalling discussed the benefits of\ndynamic build agents and demonstrated various ways to implement them such as\nthe EC2 and Docker plugins. There was a lot of interest and discussion,\nespecially around Docker and the ability it provides to have ephemeral agents\nwith very little provisioning time.\n\nThe recording can be downloaded from\nGooel Drive.\n\nLinks\n\nStart a JAM in your city if there isn’t one already.\n\nBecome a JAM member.\n\nBecome an online JAM member\n\nBe a JAM speaker or sponsor.
