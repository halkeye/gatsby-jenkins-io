Rather, there&#8217;s an custom Groovy interpreter\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-plugin\">CPS</a>) that executes the\nScripted Pipeline in a manner which provides the durability/resumability that\ndefines Jenkins Pipeline.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Without diving into too much detail, refer to the pull requests linked to\nJENKINS-26481 for that, the code snippet above was particularly challenging to\nrectify inside the Pipeline execution layer. As one of the chief architects for\nJenkins Pipeline, Jesse made a number of changes around the problem in 2016,\nbut it wasn&#8217;t until early 2017 when Andrew, working on Declarative Pipeline,\nstarted to identify a number of areas of improvement in CPS and provided\nmultiple patches and test cases.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As luck would have it, combining two of the sharpest minds in the Jenkins\nproject resulted in the \"Small Matter of Programming\" being finished, and\nreleased in May of this year with <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps\">Pipeline: Groovy</a> 2.33.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Please join me in congratulating, and thanking, Andrew and Jesse for their\ndiligent and hard work smashing one of the most despised bugs in Jenkins\nhistory :).</p>\n</div>","id":"529abe58-b0d2-5d12-931f-675712ff69a6","title":"Closure on enumerators in Pipeline","date":"2017-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2017/09/08/enumerators-in-pipeline/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
