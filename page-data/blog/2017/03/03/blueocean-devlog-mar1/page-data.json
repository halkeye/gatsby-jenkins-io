There was a beta late last week, so this week we\nthought we would let people have a rest from the upgrade treadmill for once.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>One notable feature that has recently landed is \"escaping to Classic\" When you\nsee the exit symbol (door with arrow) it will take you to an equivalent page in\nclassic Jenkins (if one exists).

Tangentially related, we also are planning to improve\nbrowser-testing in Blue Ocean as well. What is perhaps more exciting is that\nmore people, like <a href=\"https://github.com/dragoonis\">Paul Dragoonis</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/m4dc4p\">other folks</a>, are starting to contribute some\nfixes which have been lingering around for a while.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Up Next:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Round trip Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor changes with load/save</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bundling the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor with the \"aggregator\" Blue Ocean\nplugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some release candidates!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in helping to make Blue Ocean a great user experience for\nJenkins, please join the Blue Ocean development team on\n<a href=\"https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin\">Gitter</a>!</p>\n</div>","id":"dd9c32a3-a7f9-5971-8384-dc663c2c005a","title":"Blue Ocean Dev Log: March Week #1","date":"2017-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2017/03/03/blueocean-devlog-mar1/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/19e71/michaelneale.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/77b35/michaelneale.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/d4a57/michaelneale.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/19e71/michaelneale.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/ef6ff/michaelneale.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/8257c/michaelneale.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/6766a/michaelneale.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c8520897a1db139d524965f5bb7ccc/michaelneale.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"michaelneale","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Michael is a CD enthusiast with a interest in User Experience.\nHe is a co-founder of CloudBees and a long time OSS developer, and can often be found\nlurking around the jenkins-dev mailing list or #jenkins on irc (same nick as twitter name).\nBefore CloudBees he worked at Red Hat.</p>\n</div>","id":"michaelneale","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Michael Neale","slug":"/blog/authors/michaelneale","twitter":"michaelneale"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"dd9c32a3-a7f9-5971-8384-dc663c2c005a"}},
