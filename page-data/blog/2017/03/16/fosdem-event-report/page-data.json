For the uninitiated, Belgian beers tend to be strong, as the FOSDEM organizers warn:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Unlike some other beers, Belgian beer is not just coloured water.

The table is where many contributors, myself included, have\na rare opportunity to talk with dozens of enthusiastic Jenkins users from\nacross the broader open source community. This year we were very fortunate to have a\ntremendous number of contributors available at the table to answer hundreds of\nquestions throughout the two days of FOSDEM.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I would like to thank everybody by name, but the entire weekend was such a blur\nthat I&#8217;m not sure I would be able to remember everybody who helped!
