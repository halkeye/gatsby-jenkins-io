Adoption of Jenkins 2, which featured \"Pipeline as code\" and\nencouraged users to adopt <a href=\"/doc/book/pipeline\">Jenkins Pipeline</a>, has\nskyrocketed to more than half of all Jenkins installations.  Other data\nremained consistent with findings year-to-year, for example, the number of\nJenkins users continues to increase and 90% of survey respondents still\nconsider Jenkins mission-critical.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/files/2016-jenkins-community-survey.pdf\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2016-community-survey/2016-survey-mission-critical.png\" alt=\"90% consider Jenkins mission-critical\"></a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/files/2016-jenkins-community-survey.pdf\">Get the survey infographic PDF</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/files/2016-jenkins-community-survey-responses.pdf\">Get the complete survey results in PDF</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Here are some of the key findings:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>85% of respondants indicated that Jenkins usage had increased</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>30% of organizations with more than 50 software projects used Jenkins in 2016 as compared to 16% in 2015</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An impressive 46% of respondents were running Jenkins 2.x, eight months after\nits release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adoption of <a href=\"/doc/book/pipeline\">Jenkins Pipeline</a> for continuous delivery\n(CD) is accelerating, 54% of respondents who have adopted CD are using Pipeline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>61% of respondents are deploying changes to production at least once per week</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Linux is the platform of choice for builds, favored by 85% of respondents</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>85% of respondants use Git as the source code repository</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Half of respondents are deploying applications directly to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services as the favored platform</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We want to thank everyone for completing the survey, and congratulations to\nIker Garcia for winning a free pass to\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home\">Jenkins World 2017</a> and to\nDave Leifer for winning the Amazon gift card.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to creating a 2017 Community Survey later this year and\nhearing more from users at Jenkins World 2017 in San Francisco, we hope to\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home\">see you there!</a></p>\n</div>","id":"cd9ac93a-3ea0-5543-8c2e-1e647b9eb8a1","title":"The State of Jenkins - 2016 Community Survey","date":"2017-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2017/03/24/jenkins-community-survey/","authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"https://www.cloudbees.com/blogs/bhavani-rao","github":null,"html":"","id":"brao","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Bhavani Rao","slug":"/blog/authors/brao/","twitter":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"cd9ac93a-3ea0-5543-8c2e-1e647b9eb8a1"}},
