I had bumped it to 250 the day before the workshop, and asked for another one to 500 <strong>during</strong> the workshop (though in the end, 250 was probably enough, but this&#8217;ll give room for the next time with more people :-)).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logistics: warning, secret ahead: this is very time consuming.\nNot necessarily the amount of work itself, more that it implies very big latency.\nFor instance, give it 2 to 3 weeks minimum to have answers about sponsoring in general. Pinging again in case of no answer after 2 days would probably be seen as rude, and possibly lead to make things worse for obvious reasons, so plan ahead.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"thank-you\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#thank-you\"></a>Thank you</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com\">DigitalOcean</a> for sponsoring the Infrastructure</p>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We got way more than 100 VMs running at the same time during the day thanks to their help!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.harrycow.com/\">HarryCow Coworking</a> for hosting the event</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> for sponsoring the food for all the participants</p>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Also for providing a bunch of goodies: stickers and T-Shirts for everybody</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> for providing stickers</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<div class=\"footnote\" id=\"_footnotedef_1\">\n<a href=\"#_footnoteref_1\">1</a>.
