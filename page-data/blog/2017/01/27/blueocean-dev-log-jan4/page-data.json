This week was 10 steps forward, and about 1.5 backwards&#8230;&#8203;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There were two releases this week, <code>b19</code> and <code>b20</code>. Unfortunately, <code>b20</code> had to\nbe released shortly after <code>b19</code> hit the Update Center as an incompatible API\nchange in a 3rd party plugin was discovered.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Regardless, the latest <code>b20</code> has a <strong>lot</strong> of important improvements, and some\nvery nice new features.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean-dev-log/pipeline-creation-flow.png\" alt=\"Creating a Pipeline in Blue Ocean\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A first cut of the \"Create Pipeline\" UX, seen above, allowing you to create Git\nbased <a href=\"/doc/book/pipeline/multibranch/\">Multibranch Pipelines</a> like you have never seen before.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Handling network disconnections from the browser to server (eg server\nrestart, network etc) gracefully with a nice UI.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More precise time information for steps and running Pipelines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More information when a Pipeline is blocked on infrastructure, such as when\nthe Pipeline is waiting for an agent to become available.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a really embarrassing typo (a prize if you spot it).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Test reports now include stdout and stderr</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Better support for parallel visualisation, such as when a <code>parallel</code> step exists outside of a stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Visual Editor also had another release, with the \"sheets\" visual component\nand better validation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"creation\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#creation\"></a>Creation</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Currently this is hidden behind a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle\">feature toggle</a>,\nto access append <code>?blueCreate</code> to the URL in you browser, and then press the\n\"New Pipeline\" button. Currently it lets you quickly create a Pipeline from\nGit, add credentials, etc, in a very nice UX. More SCM types are being added to\nsupport this.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"reconnectdisconnect\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#reconnectdisconnect\"></a>Reconnect/disconnect</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean-dev-log/connection-lost.png\" alt=\"Lost connection\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As Blue Ocean is a very \"live\" style of UX, if your network becomes\nunavailable, or the server is restarted, it is good to know in case you\nwere staring at the screen waiting for something to happen (don&#8217;t you have\nanything better to do??). When this happens, now you get a polite message,\nand then when the connection is restored, even if you are waiting for a\nPipeline run to finish, it will then notice this, and refresh things for\nyou:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean-dev-log/connection-ok.png\" alt=\"Reconnected\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Note the opacity changes to make it clear even if you don&#8217;t see the little\nmessage. Very nice addition for those of us who work on a train far to often.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"up-next\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#up-next\"></a>Up next</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>What is up next:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>SCM Api changes should land, making things much better for users of\nGitHub, Bitbucket, and many more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Creating Pipelines from GitHub (including automatic discovery).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lots of fixes and enhancements in the Pipeline from all over the place</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More ATH <sup class=\"footnote\">[<a id=\"_footnoteref_1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#_footnotedef_1\" title=\"View footnote.\">1</a>]</sup> coverage against regressions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More Visual Editor releases as Declarative Pipeline reaches version 1.0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvements to i18n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There was also a couple of \"alternative beta\" releases in the \"Experimental\nUpdate Center\" to help test the new SCM API improvements for better use of\nGitHub APIs (based on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin/pull/742\">this branch</a>)\nI do not recommend trying this branch unless you know what you are doing,\nas this will migrate some data, but help testing it would be appreciated!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in helping to make Blue Ocean a great user experience for\nJenkins, please join the Blue Ocean development team on\n<a href=\"https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin\">Gitter</a>!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<div class=\"footnote\" id=\"_footnotedef_1\">\n<a href=\"#_footnoteref_1\">1</a>.
