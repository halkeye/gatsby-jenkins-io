It&#8217;s been a\nbusy-as-usual week as everyone comes back from vacation.  A couple of new betas\nwent out this week. Of note:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>input</code> to Pipelines is now supported, a much asked for feature (see below)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new French translation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some optimisations (especially around reducing number of HTTP calls). We\nhave started using\n<a href=\"https://gtmetrix.com\">gtmetrix.com</a>\nto measure changes on\n<a href=\"https://ci.blueocean.io\">\"dogfood\"</a>\nto get some numbers around optimisations on the web tier.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And a grab bag of other great bug fixes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/blueocean/input-step.png\" alt=\"Using the input step in Blue Ocean\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Also a bunch of work has been done to support parametrized pipelines, as\nwell as creation of new multibranch pipelines (both are much asked for).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There is also now an \"official\" Docker image being published to\n<a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean/\">Docker Hub</a>.

The container also has tags available (e.g.\n<code>jenkinsci/blueocean:1.0.0-b16</code>) for grabbing a specific released version.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Up next for Blue Ocean development as we march towards 1.0:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Support for parametrized jobs.
