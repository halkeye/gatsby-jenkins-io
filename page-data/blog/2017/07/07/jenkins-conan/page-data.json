The main reason for this is performance, which is critical to many of these industries, and cannot be compared to any other technology.\nAs a counterpart, the C/C&#43;&#43; ecosystem has a few important challenges to face:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Huge projects</strong> - With millions of lines of code, it’s very hard to manage your projects without using modern tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Application Binary Interface (ABI) incompatibility</strong> - To guarantee the compatibility of a library with other libraries and your application,  different configurations (such as the operating system, architecture, and compiler) need to be under control.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Slow compilation times</strong> - Due to header inclusion and pre-processor bloat, together with the challenges mentioned above, it requires special attention to optimize the process and rebuild only the libraries that need to be rebuilt.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Code linkage and inlining</strong> - A static C/C&#43;&#43; library can embed headers from a dependent library. Also, a shared library can embed a static library. In both cases, you need to manage the rebuild of your library when any of its dependencies change.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Varied ecosystem</strong> - There are many different compilers and build systems, for different platforms, targets and purposes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This post will show how to implement DevOps best practices for C/C&#43;&#43; development, using <strong>Jenkins</strong> CI, <strong>Conan</strong> C/C&#43;&#43; package manager, and <strong>JFrog Artifactory</strong> the universal artifact repository.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"conan-the-cc-package-manager\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#conan-the-cc-package-manager\"></a>Conan, The C/C&#43;&#43; Package Manager</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://conan.io\">Conan</a> was born to mitigate these pains.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Conan uses python recipes, describing how to build a library by explicitly calling any build system, and also describing the needed information for the consumers (include directories, library names etc.).\nTo manage the different configurations and the ABI compatibility, Conan uses \"settings\" (os, architecture, compiler…). When a setting is changed, Conan generates a different binary version for the same library:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2017-07-07/diagram1.png\" alt=\"diagram1\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The built binaries can be uploaded to <a href=\"https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/\">JFrog Artifactory</a> or <a href=\"https://www.jfrog.com/bintray/\">Bintray</a>, to be shared with your team or the whole community. The developers in your team won’t need to rebuild the libraries again, Conan will fetch only the needed Binary packages matching the user’s configuration from the configured remotes (distributed model).\nBut there are still some more challenges to solve:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How to manage the development and release process of your C/C&#43;&#43; projects?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to distribute your C/C&#43;&#43; libraries?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to test your C/C&#43;&#43; project?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to generate multiple packages for different configurations?\n*How to manage the rebuild of the libraries when one of them changes?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"conan-ecosystem\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#conan-ecosystem\"></a>Conan Ecosystem</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Conan ecosystem is growing fast, and DevOps with C/C&#43;&#43; is now a reality:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>JFrog Artifactory</strong> manages the full development and releasing cycles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>JFrog Bintray</strong> is the universal distribution hub.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Jenkins</strong> automates the project testing, generates different binary configurations of your Conan packages, and automates the rebuilt libraries.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2017-07-07/diagram2.png\" alt=\"diagram2\"></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"jenkins-artifactory-plugin\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#jenkins-artifactory-plugin\"></a>Jenkins Artifactory plugin</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provides a Conan DSL, a very generic but powerful way to call Conan from a Jenkins Pipeline script.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Manages the remote configuration with your Artifactory instance, hiding the authentication details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Collects from any Conan operation (installing/uploading packages) all the involved artifacts to generate and publish the buildInfo to Artifactory.

Here are several ways to optimize the process:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Only re-build the libraries that need to be rebuilt. These are the libraries that  have been affected by a dependant library that has changed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build in parallel, if possible. When there is no relation between two or more libraries in the project graph, you can build them in parallel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build different configurations (os, compiler, etc) in parallel. Use different agents if needed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Let’s see an example using Jenkins Pipeline feature</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2017-07-07/diagram3.png\" alt=\"diagram3\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The above graph represents our project P and its dependencies (A-G). We want to distribute the project for two different architectures, x86 and x86_64.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>What happens if we change library A?</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If we bump the version to A(v1) there is no problem, we can update the B requirement and also bump its version to B(v1) and so on. The complete flow would be as follows:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Push A(v1) version to Git, Jenkins will build the x86 and x86_64 binaries. Jenkins will upload all the packages to Artifactory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Manually change B to v1, now depending on A1, push to Git, Jenkins will build the B(v1) for x86 and x86_64 using the retrieved new A1 from Artifactory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repeat the same process for C, D, F, G and finally our project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>But if we are developing our libraries in a development repository, we probably depend on the latest A version or will override A (v0) packages on every git push, and we want to automatically rebuild the affected libraries in this case B, D, F, G and P.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>How we can do this with Jenkins Pipelines?</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>First we need to know which libraries need to be rebuilt. The \"conan info --build_order\" command identifies the libraries that were changed in our project, and also tells us which can be rebuilt in parallel.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So, we created two Jenkins pipelines tasks:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/lasote/skynet_example/blob/master/single_build.groovy\">\"SimpleBuild\"</a> task which builds every single library. Similar to the first example using Conan DSL with the Jenkins Artifactory plugin. It’s a parameterized task that receives the libraries that need to built.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/lasote/skynet_example/blob/master/multi_build.groovy\">\"MultiBuild\"</a> task which coordinates and launches the \"<strong>SimpleBuild</strong>\" tasks, in parallel when possible.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We also have a repository with a configuration yml. The Jenkins tasks will use it to know where the recipe of each library is, and the different profiles to be used. In this case they are <strong>x86</strong> and <strong>x86_64</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">leaves:\n  PROJECT:\n    profiles:\n       - ./profiles/osx_64\n       - ./profiles/osx_32</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">artifactory:\n  name: artifactory\n  repo: conan-local</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">repos:\n LIB_A/1.0:\n   url: https://github.com/lasote/skynet_example.git\n   branch: master\n   dir: ./recipes/A</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">LIB_B/1.0:\n url: https://github.com/lasote/skynet_example.git\n branch: master\n dir: ./recipes/b</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">…</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">PROJECT:\n url: https://github.com/lasote/skynet_example.git\n branch: master\n dir: ./recipes/PROJECT</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If we change and push library A to the repository, the \"<strong>MultiBuild</strong>\" task will be triggered.

It requires a big investment of time but can save huge amounts of time in the development and releasing life cycle for the long run.

Very soon, adoption of DevOps for C/C&#43;&#43; companies will be a must!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins example shown above that demonstrating how to control the library building in parallel is just Groovy code and a custom convenient yml file. The great thing about it is not the example or the code itself.
