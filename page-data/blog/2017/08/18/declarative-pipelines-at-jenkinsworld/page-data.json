It&#8217;s been a great year for Declarative\nand Pipeline in general, with the release of Declarative Pipeline 1.0 in\nFebruary, multiple releases since then, the introduction of\n<a href=\"/doc/book/pipeline/\">documentation on Pipeline at jenkins.io</a>,\nwith a focus on Declarative, and more. Given everything that&#8217;s happened over\nthe last year, we thought it&#8217;d be good to let you all know what you can expect\nto see and hear about Declarative Pipeline at this year&#8217;s Jenkins World.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>First, on Thursday, August 31, I&#8217;ll be giving a talk on Declarative Pipeline\nwith <a href=\"https://github.com/rsandell\">Robert Sandell</a>, one of my coworkers\nhere at CloudBees and another author of Declarative Pipeline. We&#8217;ll be\ncovering what&#8217;s happened with Declarative over the last year, new features\nadded since the 1.0 release, such as the <code>libraries</code> directive and more <code>when</code>\nconditions, what&#8217;s planned for the upcoming 1.2 release (which is planned for\nshortly after Jenkins World!), including parallel <code>stage</code>s, and what&#8217;s on the\nroadmap for the future. In addition, we&#8217;ll be demoing some of the features in\n1.2, and providing some pointers on best practices for writing your Declarative\nPipeline.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Also on Thursday, <a href=\"https://github.com/stephendonner\">Stephen Donner from Mozilla</a>\nwill be giving a demo showing Mozilla&#8217;s usage of Declarative Pipeline and\nshared libraries at the Community Booth - Mozilla has been doing great work\nwith Declarative, and I&#8217;m excited to see their usage in more detail and hear\nStephen talk about their experience!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In addition, Robert, Stephen, and myself will all be at Jenkins World both days\nof the main sessions, and Robert and myself will also be at the\n<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/241213280/\">Contributor Summit</a>\non Tuesday. We&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on Declarative and will be happy to\nanswer any questions that we can. Looking forward to seeing you all!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonitionblock warning\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"icon\">\n<i class=\"fa icon-warning\" title=\"Warning\"></i>\n</td>\n<td class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Andrew Bayer and Robert Sandell will be talking about the latest on\n<a href=\"https://jenkinsworld20162017.sched.com/event/ALOd/declarative-pipelines-in-jenkins\">Declarative Pipeline in Jenkins</a>\n at <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home\">Jenkins World</a> in August,\nregister with the code <code>JWFOSS</code> for a 30% discount off your pass.</p>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>","id":"e2e86b67-d732-51e3-9127-44de5e51de0e","title":"Declarative Pipeline at Jenkins World","date":"2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2017/08/18/declarative-pipelines-at-jenkinsworld/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"abayer","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Andrew was a core committer to Hudson and the author of numerous plugins.</p>\n</div>","id":"abayer","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Andrew Bayer","slug":"/blog/author/abayer","twitter":"abayer"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2017/08/21/jenkins-world-demos/","previous":"/blog/2017/08/17/speaker-blog-blazemeter/","id":"e2e86b67-d732-51e3-9127-44de5e51de0e"}},
