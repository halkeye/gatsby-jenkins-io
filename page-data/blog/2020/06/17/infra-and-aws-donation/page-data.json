href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/\">plugins.jenkins.io</a>, ticketing systems like <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/\">issues.jenkins.io</a>  , CI/CD infrastructure like <a href=\"https://ci.jenkins.io/\">ci.jenkins.io</a> , and many other services.\nJust to provide some context about the Jenkins infrastructure scale, here are some stats from April 2020:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Over 600 000 people visited <a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/\">www.jenkins.io</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Over 250 000 Jenkins servers regularly checked the\n<a href=\"https://pkg.jenkins.io/\">Jenkins package server</a> and the\n<a href=\"https://updates.jenkins.io/\">Jenkins update server</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Over 43 000 continuous integration jobs ran on <a href=\"https://ci.jenkins.io/\">ci.jenkins.io</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Over 950 plugins ran their continuous integration pipelines on <a

class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins project, as an open source project, is built and maintained by its awesome community.\nLike in any organization, there are specific people who make sure that those services are always up and running.\nEveryone is welcome to <a href=\"/participate\">participate</a>.\nInfrastructure is no exception, we are always <a href=\"/projects/infrastructure/#contributing\">looking for new contributors</a> to the infrastructure!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>While we can&#8217;t share publicly everything like secrets and certificates,\nwe still try to be as transparent as possible so that everybody can understand and improve our infrastructure without having privileged access.\nWhat better way than using Git to manage infrastructure work?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"who-said-gitops\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#who-said-gitops\"></a>Who said GitOps?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Since the creation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra\">Jenkins-infra organization</a> on GitHub in March 2008, more than 650 people have contributed to over 80 git repositories.\nThose contributions make the Jenkins community what it is today.\nIf you can&#8217;t find something there, it probably means that some help is welcomed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>More recently, with help from <a href=\"https://github.com/halkeye\">Gavin Mogan</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/timja\">Tim Jacomb</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/slide\">Alex Earl</a>, big achievements have been possible on many fronts like automating Jenkins releases, refreshing <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/\">plugins.jenkins.io</a>, adding new agents to <a href=\"https://ci.jenkins.io/computer/\">ci.jenkins.io</a>, and maintaining our Kubernetes cluster.\nWe thank them for their help and for the infrastructure progress they have enabled.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"infrastructure-at-scale\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#infrastructure-at-scale\"></a>Infrastructure at Scale</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Running infrastructure at the scale the Jenkins project does is expensive and sometimes quite challenging.\nWe are fortunate enough to be supported by many leading companies that provide us their expertise, their products, and their support.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Recently, Amazon Web Services donated $60 000 to run Jenkins infrastructure on the AWS cloud.\nWe&#8217;re so grateful for their donation and for the flexibility it provides.\nWe&#8217;re running Linux agents with AMD64 and ARM64 architectures on AWS.\nWe&#8217;re using AWS cloud for our Windows agents.\nThe generous infrastructure donation from Amazon Web Services has increased our continuous integration capacity and broadened our platform coverage.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"our-sponsors\"><a class=\"anchor\"
