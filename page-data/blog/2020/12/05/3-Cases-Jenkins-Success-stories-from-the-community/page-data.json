We found that some submitted stories were far too big to be constrained by our format of 'background/goal/solution/results.'</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Some Jenkins users had a much more complex story to tell, whether it was about getting upper management to buy-in, keeping developers happy, or simply making sure pipelines weren&#8217;t just bottlenecks in disguise.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Here are a handful of <a href=\"https://jenkinsistheway.io/case-studies/\">Jenkins Case Studies</a> we&#8217;ve published in the past few months, with many more on the way!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"case-study-1-d4science\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#case-study-1-d4science\"></a>Case Study #1: D4Science</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"amping-up-scientific-research-with-cicd-powered-by-jenkins\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#amping-up-scientific-research-with-cicd-powered-by-jenkins\"></a>Amping up scientific research with CI/CD powered by Jenkins</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To promote open science practices and support scientific communities while serving 11k registered users in 45 countries, <a href=\"https://www.d4science.org/\">D4Science</a> introduced a new delivery pipeline that replaced their pre-existing build platform.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Of course, they had to build and release their software framework (gCube) in a way that would support multi-project releases at scale — from 200+ Git repositories within the same day! It had to be fast, automate all release activities, and it had to deliver incremental releases to address user requirements quickly. Most of all, the solution had to be cost-effective.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Using Jenkins, they created an innovative approach to software delivery: a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, scalable, easy to maintain, and upgradable at a minimal cost.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Discover how D4Science empowers e-Science and virtual research communities with software released via Jenkins. <a href=\"https://jenkinsistheway.io/case-studies/d4science-amps-up-their-scientific-research-platform-with-ci-cd-powered-by-jenkins/\">Read the Jenkins case study featuring D4Science here!</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"case-study-2-gainsight\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#case-study-2-gainsight\"></a>Case Study #2: Gainsight</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"humanizing-csx-with-tech-innovation-and-a-robust-devsecops-platform\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#humanizing-csx-with-tech-innovation-and-a-robust-devsecops-platform\"></a>Humanizing CSX with tech innovation and a robust DevSecOps platform</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gainsight.com/\">Gainsight&#8217;s</a> customer service experience platform helps customer success teams at more than 100 leading IT and healthcare clients. How? By driving engagement for tens of thousands of their customers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>That&#8217;s why the engineering team at Gainsight approached the customer experience by building a smarter, faster DevSecOps platform using Jenkins. They stuck to an infrastructure-as-code approach while integrating various tools and programming languages all within the platform. And they secured processes with better visibility and air-tight quality control.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The result was a flexible DevSecOps infrastructure, 95% of which is scalable with code. And the cost of infrastructure costs was 40% less. That provides Gainsight with ease of collaboration, keener operational insight, and — because builds are 30% faster — the ability to stay a step ahead of the competition.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Read why Gainsight&#8217;s lead DevOps engineer, Prudviraj Pentakota, says \"Jenkins is the epicenter of DevSecOps in our organization.\" <a href=\"https://jenkinsistheway.io/case-studies/jenkins-case-study-gainsight/\">Get the full story here.</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"case-study-3-avoris-travel\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#case-study-3-avoris-travel\"></a>Case Study #3: Avoris Travel</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"reinventing-travel-with-an-inventive-technology-platform\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#reinventing-travel-with-an-inventive-technology-platform\"></a>Reinventing travel with an inventive technology platform</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Part of Barceló Group, <a href=\"https://www.avoristravel.com/\">Ávoris Travel</a> is behind prominent destination travel brands like LeSki, Le Musik, and a selection of author travels under its \"Viagens Com Assinatura\" signature travel concept. A proprietary database and a smart, dynamic booking engine are the tickets to offering differentiating and inventive travel opportunities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Also unique to Avoris is a discreet machining technology that enables agents to enter specific criteria to search and find all types of trips and travel opportunities across the entire network.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>\"Our infrastructure is very important because we have to be online to meet customer demand anywhere in the world,\" said Alejandro Alvarez Vazquez, Sysadmin, Avoris Travel. \"Our CI/CD platform is used by 200 people.
