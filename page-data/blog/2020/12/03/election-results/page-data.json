Jenkins Governance Board elections:\nAndrey Falko, Ewelina Wilkosz, Frederic Gurr, Gavin Mogan, Justin Harringa,\nMark Waite, Marky Jackson, Steven Terrana, and Zhao Xiaojie (Rick).\nAll of them are awesome community leaders who actively contribute to the Jenkins project and\nrepresent its users.\nIt would be an honor to have them on the Jenkins board.\nRegardless of the election results, we appreciate their participation and the time they invested in these elections.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This year we were electing 2 governance board members.\nWe were using the <a

I am so humbled.\nBeing part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.\nMy goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.\nI look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n&#8212; Marky Jackson, Jenkins Governance Board Member and Events Officer\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Statement from Gavin Mogan:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Gavin here.

This is truly exciting.\nI plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.\nThis is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.\nMy specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n&#8212; Gavin Mogan, Jenkins Governance Board

href=\"#statistics\"></a>Statistics</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.\nIt is significantly lower than in the <a href=\"/blog/2019/12/16/board-election-results/\">2019 elections</a> when we had almost 350 voters.\nIt can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.\nThis year we decided to not use the previous <a href=\"/blog/2019/11/08/board-elections/\">voter registration system</a>,\nand we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.\nThis is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"whats-next-for-the-board\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#whats-next-for-the-board\"></a>What&#8217;s next for the board?</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.\nWith help of many contributors and with the renewed board,\nwe have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,\nfor example hosting contributor summits,\npublishing the <a href=\"/project/roadmap/\">public roadmap</a>,\n<a href=\"/project/conduct/\">Code of Conduct update</a>,\n<a href=\"https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/08/25/jenkins-terminology-changes/\">terminology changes</a>,\nand <a href=\"/blog/2020/08/04/cdf-graduation/\">graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation</a>.\nThere is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:\nlong-anticipated features and architecture changes,\nchanging the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep\">Jenkins Enhancement Proposal</a> process,\ncreating better communication channels with Jenkins users,\nand onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.\nThe ideas will be discussed in <a href=\"/mailing-lists/\">mailing lists</a> and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what&#8217;s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to contribute!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div
