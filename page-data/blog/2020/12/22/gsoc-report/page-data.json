summit</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>This is a regular gathering for Google Summer of Code mentors and org admins where they share their experiences about GSoC, outreach programs, community management, and tools.\nUsually it is organized as a multi-day unconference after the end of GSoC, with 2-3 representatives from each project.\nIt has been a great learning experience to participate in it.\nThis year it was a single-day virtual event, and all mentors were able to attend.\n<a href=\"/blog/authors/shivaylamba/\">Shivay Lamba</a>, one of the GSoC 2020 mentors, also did a lightning talk about the GSoC

contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.\nThis is the third year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag,\nIn the previous years the swag logistics was one of the most challenging tasks for org admins during the entire project.\nand we highly appreciate help from CDF with this part.\nAs DevOps World presenters, the students have also received special edition

participants to gather their feedback and suggestions.\nWe also recommended that project teams hold their own retrospective meetings.\nSuch information is instrumental to continuously improving GSoC in the Jenkins community.\nWe thank all contributors who shared their feedback!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The organization-wide retrospective was organized as a survey and a series of retrospective meetings.\nYou can find aggregated results in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NIszUtuXmHiu8X2WrgAEQFK6aVodsmM4I0RSNRf4TS0/edit?usp=sharing\">this Google Doc</a>.\nOverall, we received very positive feedback from students and mentors.\nThe GSoC framework in Jenkins has matured significantly during the previous years.\nThe effort we invested to create guidelines and recommendations for all parties helped a lot because all the expectations were known in advance.\nAs usual, there is much to improve, especially with regards to the community bonding phases and cross-project communications.\nWe are processing the feedback, and we will expand our documentation and the contributor onboarding plans next year.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"some-personal-notes\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#some-personal-notes\"></a>Some personal notes</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I have been involved in leading and coordinating Google Summer of Code in open source projects since 2016.\nThis year I visited the GSoC stand at FOSDEM and met a few organizers and former students.\nA few days after, I proposed participating in GSoC at the Jenkins contributor summit in Brussels,\nand several contributors supported this idea.\nWe spent several hours to create the first Jenkins GSoC page and brainstorm on project ideas.\nWe submitted our application and were accepted.\nThanks a lot to the Google team that gave us a chance!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It is great to work with the students and see how they explore the open source community and grow professionally as engineers.\nIt is also awesome to see how some of them stay in the project and keep contributing,\nincluding becoming plugin maintainers and GSoC mentors.\nBut, for me, Google Summer of Code is not just about mentoring.\nIt also helps a lot with the community bonding&#8230;&#8203; for the existing community like Jenkins which has a lot of isolated sub-communities in plugins.\nMany maintainers work alone, and it can be quite lonely working to maintain a plugin without feedback, developer ideas, and user interactions.\nWhen plugin contributors become project mentors, they join the wider community effort and work in teams.\nIn many cases they start contributing to the organization-wide activities and goals,\nand it grows the \"backbone\" of the Jenkins community.\nLike other community-driven projects, we need such backbone to scale the community and onboard more contributors to the countless Jenkins components.\nSo far it works really well and GSoC excels among outreach programs in this regard.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I would like to thank the Google Open Source team, students and all Jenkins community members for the great Google Summer of Code this year.\nWe also thank the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help to recognize contributors and allow organization administrators to focus on projects.\nLast but not least, I would like to thank the Jenkins org admin team:\n<a href=\"/blog/authors/martinda\">Martin d&#8217;Anjou</a>,\n<a href=\"/blog/authors/markyjackson-taulia\">Marky Jackson</a>, and\n<a href=\"/blog/authors/marckk/\">Kara de la Marck</a>.\nThis was a crazy year for everyone. Regardless of that, the org admins stepped up and took responsibility for students and mentors involved in the project, with a serious time commitment.\nNot all work by the organizers is publicly visible (applications, project selection, resolving conflicts),\nbut this work is essential to the project&#8217;s success.\nThanks a lot to org admins and mentors who helped with the administrative tasks this year!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"whats-about-gsoc-2021\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#whats-about-gsoc-2021\"></a>What&#8217;s about GSoC 2021?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Yes, we plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021.\nThe application period for organizations will start in a few months,\nbut we have already started preparing for the next GSoC session.\nWe are looking for mentors, org admins and project ideas.\nPlease <a href=\"/project/gsoc#contacts\">contact us</a> if you are interested!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/2020/12/16/call-for-mentors/\">Call for Mentors and Project Ideas</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"./2021/project-ideas\">GSoC 2021 project ideas</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/projects/gsoc/proposing-project-ideas\">HOWTO: Propose a project idea</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/projects/gsoc/mentors\">Information for mentors</a>: guidelines and expectations</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We invite potential students to start exploring the project and the available project ideas.\nOriginal ideas are always welcome in the project, and starting early is a great opportunity to\nget introduced to the Jenkins community, collect more information about the problem areas,\nand to create a good proposal.\n\"Start early\" is the most popular recommendation from GSoC 2020 participants to future GSoC students,\nand we encourage you to follow this advice!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"c343609c-9f27-5839-9053-d4fffab8550f","title":"Google Summer of Code 2020 summary","date":"2020-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2020/12/22/gsoc-report/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/author/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2021/01/12/new-year-report/","previous":"/blog/2020/12/17/jira-upgrade-for-the-jenkins-project/","id":"c343609c-9f27-5839-9053-d4fffab8550f"}},
