I had an early morning flight to Lisbon\nfrom Delhi via Istanbul. At the Airport, I met Parichay who had been\nwaiting there from his connecting flight. After flying 8000 km, we\nreached Lisbon. We took a taxi to the hotel and were greeted there by\none of my Google Summer of Code mentors, Oleg. After four months of\nworking with him on my GSoC project, meeting him was an amazing\nexperience. Later that day, after stretching our legs in the hotel, we\nmet Long for an early dinner, who came to the hotel after exploring much\nof Lisbon.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"day-1-hackfest-december-2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#day-1-hackfest-december-2\"></a>Day 1: Hackfest, December 2</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-02.png\" alt=\"A photo from the HackFest\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Next morning, we all met for breakfast where we all got to taste some\nPastel de Nata. We then took a cab to the Congress Centre for attending\nthe Jenkins and Jenkins X hackfest. At the Hackfest, I met Mark, Joseph,\nKasper, Andrey and other Jenkins contributors. I also met Oleg, this\ntime together with his son and his wife. After our introductions, and a\nshort presentation by Oleg, I started hacking on the Folder Auth plugin\nand made it possible to delete user sids from roles. The best part of\nhacking there was to get instant feedback on what I was working on. More\nand more people kept coming throughout the day. It was great to see so\nmany people working hard to improve Jenkins. At the end, everyone\npresented what they had achieved that day. Having skipped lunch for some\nsnacks, Oleg and others tried hard to get some pizza delivered without\nmuch success. After the Hackfest, everyone was hungry and most attendees\nincluding me went looking for nearby restaurants. Since it was early and\nmost restaurants were not open yet, we all decided to have burgers. It\nwas a great learning experience listening to and talking about Jenkins,\nElasticsearch, Jira, GitHub and a lot of other things. After that, we\ntook a taxi back to the hotel and I went to bed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-03.png\" alt=\"Sunset outside the conference center\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"day-2-contributor-summit-december-3\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#day-2-contributor-summit-december-3\"></a>Day 2: Contributor Summit, December 3</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We had the Jenkins and Jenkins X contributor summit the next day. Me and\nParichay took the bus to the Congress Centre in the morning. After\nregistration, I got my ‘Speaker’ badge and the conference T-shirt. The\ncontributor summit took place in the same hall as the Hackfest, but the\nseating arrangement was completely different and there were a lot more\npeople. The summit started with everyone introducing themselves. It\nturned out that there were a lot of people from Munich. There were\npresentations and talks about all things Jenkins, Jenkins X and the\nContinuous Delivery Foundation by Kohsuke, Oleg, Joseph, Liam, Olivier,\nWadek and others. I had no experience with Jenkins X which made the\nsummit very interesting. After lunch, the talks were over, and everyone\nwas free to join any session discussing various things about Jenkins. I\nattended the Cloud Native Jenkins and the Configuration-as-Code\nsessions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-04.png\" alt=\"The Contributor Summit\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-05.png\" alt=\"My badge\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>While some of the conference attendees were in the Contributor summit,\nthe others were going through certifications and trainings. At around 5\no’clock in the evening, the summit and the trainings all got over and\nthe expo hall was thrown open. On the entrance, there was a large stack\nof big DWJW bags. I did not realize why those bags were kept there.\nSince everyone was taking one, I took one as well. As soon as I went\ninto the hall, I realized that those bags were for collecting swag. I\nhad never seen anything like this where sponsors were just giving away\nT-shirts, stickers and other stuff. There were snacks and Kohsuke was\ncutting the extremely tasty 15 years of Jenkins cake. After having the\ncake, I went on a swag-collecting spree going from one sponsor booth to\nthe other. This was an amazing experience, not only was I able to get\ncool stuff, I was also able to learn a lot about the software these\ncompanies made and how it fits into the DevOps pipeline.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-06.png\" alt=\"Photo with Oleg\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After the conference got over, me, Long and Parichay went to the Lisbon\nMariott Hotel for the Eurodog party. After collecting another T-shirt, I\nwent to the nearest restaurant (McDonald’s) with Andrey who I had\nearlier met at the Hackfest.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-07.png\" alt=\"Kohsuke cutting cake\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-08.png\" alt=\"Photo with Kohsuke\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-09.png\" alt=\"Photo with Oleg and Joseph\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"day-3-december-4\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#day-3-december-4\"></a>Day 3: December 4</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This was the first official day of the conference and it began with the\nkeynote. There were over 900 people in the keynote hall. It was amazing\nto see so many people attending the conference. After the keynote got\nover, I went to several sessions throughout the day learning about how\ncompanies are using Jenkins and implementing DevOps tools.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-14.jpg\" alt=\"15 years of Jenkins\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the evening, we had the Sonatype Superparty which was a lot of fun.\nThere were neon lights, arcade machines, VR experiences, superheroes and\nmore swag. There was a lot of good food including pizzas and burgers and\nhot dogs. Superhero inspired desserts were very interesting. I was able\nto talk to Oleg and Wadek about the security challenges in Jenkins.\nDuring the party, I also got a chance to meet the CEO of CloudBees,\nSacha Labourey.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-10.png\" alt=\"Batman vs Superman\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-11.png\" alt=\"A photo with Bumblebee\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"day-4-december-5\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#day-4-december-5\"></a>Day 4, December 5</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This was the last day of the conference and it began with another\nkeynote. After the keynote, I attended a very interesting talk on how\nthe European Observatory built software for large telescopes using\nJenkins. After that, I prepared for my talk on the work I did during\nGoogle Summer of Code 2019. I had my presentation in the community booth\nduring the lunch time. Presenting in front of real people was an amazing\nexperience and very different from the ones we had on Zoom chats for our\nGSoC evaluations. In the evening, I got another chance to present my\nproject at the Jenkins Community Lightning Talks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-12.png\" alt=\"Me speaking at the community booth\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-13.png\" alt=\"Me speaking at the community lightining talks\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After that, the conference came to an end and I went back to the hotel.\nAfter relaxing for some time, me, Parichay and Long were invited by Oleg\nto a dinner at Corinthia Hotel with Kohsuke, Mark and his wife, Tracy,\nAlyssa, and Liam. Unfortunately, Long couldn’t attend the dinner because\nhe had the flight back earlier that evening. After the amazing dinner, I\nthanked everyone for such an amazing trip and said goodbye.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-16.jpg\" alt=\"GSoC Group Photo\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>DWJW was the best experience I’ve ever had. I was able to learn about a\nlot of new things and talk to some amazing people. In the end, I would\nlike to especially thank Oleg for helping me throughout and making it\npossible for me to attend such a wonderful conference. I would like to\nthank my other mentors Runze Xia and Supun for their support in my\nGoogle Summer of Code project. I would like to thank Google for\norganizing Google Summer of Code, everyone at Jenkins project for\nsponsoring my travel, and CloudBees for inviting me to the conference.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Looking forward to seeing you all again soon!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/role-strategy-performance/dwjw-15.jpg\" alt=\"CI.
