During the initial discussions we\ndetermined that it would be good to examine the goals of previous meetings and determine the best path forward.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A mutual decision was made that to better create a roadmap; we needed to understand better who we were aiming to help.\nWe decided that creating personas was very beneficial. Personas are fictional characters, which we are creating based\nupon our research to represent the different user types that might use Jenkins pipelines.\nCreating personas can help us step out of ourselves. It can help us to recognize that different people have different\nneeds and expectations, and it can also help us to identify with the user we are building the roadmap for. Personas make\nthe task at hand less complicated, they guide our ideation processes, and they can help us to achieve the goal of\ncreating a good user experience for our target user group.\nA lot of that work can be found here:\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdyzJwt50Wk3uUNsLMl2d4w2MGYss-phqet0s-KjbEs/edit\" class=\"bare\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdyzJwt50Wk3uUNsLMl2d4w2MGYss-phqet0s-KjbEs/edit</a>\nThe idea is to map the personas to a maturity model and then map the maturity model to the actual documentation. That\nmaturity model can be found here: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ByzWlPU0j1qM_gqspJppkNKkR5ZVLWlB/view\" class=\"bare\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ByzWlPU0j1qM_gqspJppkNKkR5ZVLWlB/view</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"how-can-i-get-involved\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#how-can-i-get-involved\"></a>How Can I Get Involved</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We have been meeting regularly to define personas to help us better create the SIG roadmap. We meet twice a week,\nonce on Thursday for the EMEA timezone and once on Friday for the US timezone.

If you\nwould like to check out the personas and give feedback, also check out the link.\nOnce we have wrapped up the personas work, we will start to identify the available documentation and ensure we have\nadequate documentation with the help of the Doc SIG.\nWe will finally then start working to build out tools to help the community with pipelines in Jenkins better.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"contact-us\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#contact-us\"></a>Contact Us</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you would like to get in touch with the Pipeline-Authoring SIG, you can by joining the\n<a href=\"https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/pipeline-authoring-sig/\">Pipeline-Authoring SIG gitter channel</a> or via the\n<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkins-pipeline-authoring-sig/\">Pipeline-Authoring SIG mailing list</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"b5d641eb-bed7-5caf-9805-42a1970f13d1","title":"Pipeline-Authoring SIG Update","date":"2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2020/03/02/pipeline-authoring-sig-update/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/markyjackson-taulia.png"},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!
