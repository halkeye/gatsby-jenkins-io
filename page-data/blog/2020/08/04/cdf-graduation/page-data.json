id=\"how-does-cdf-membership-help-us\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#how-does-cdf-membership-help-us\"></a>How does CDF membership help us?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>About 18 months ago, Jenkins <a href=\"/blog/2019/03/12/cdf-launch/\">became one of the CDF founding projects</a>, along with Jenkins X, Spinnaker and Tekton.\nA new foundation was formed to provide a vendor-neutral home for open source projects used for Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration.\nSpecial interest groups were started to foster collaboration between projects and end user companies,\nmost notably:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability\">Interoperability</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-mlops\">MLOps</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-security\">Security</a> SIGs.\nAlso, a <a href=\"https://cd.foundation/ambassador-program-overview-application/\">Community Ambassador</a> role was created to organize local meetups and to provide public-facing community representatives.\nMany former Jenkins Ambassadors and other contributors are now CDF Ambassadors, and they promote Jenkins and other projects there.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Thanks to this membership we addressed key <a href=\"/projects/infrastructure/\">project infrastructure</a> needs.\nStarting from Jan 2020, CDF covers a significant part of the infrastructure costs\nincluding our services and CI/CD instances running on Microsoft Azure.\nThe CD Foundation provided us with legal assistance required to get code signing keys for the Jenkins project.\nThanks to that, we were able to switch to a new <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release\">Jenkins Release Infrastructure</a>.\nThe foundation sponsors the Zoom account we use for <a href=\"/events/online-meetup/\">Jenkins Online Meetups</a> and community meetings.\nIn the future we will continue to review ways of reducing maintenance overhead by switching some of our self-hosted services to equivalents provided by the Linux Foundation to CDF members.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Another important CDF membership benefit is community outreach and marketing.\nIt helped us to establish connections with other CI/CD projects and end user companies.\nThrough the foundation we have access to the <a href=\"https://jenkins.devstats.cd.foundation/\">DevStats service</a>\nthat provides community contribution statistics and helps us track trends and discover areas for improvement.\nOn the marketing side, the foundation organizes webinars, podcasts and newsletters.\nJenkins is regularly represented there.\nThe CD Foundation also runs the meetup.com professional account which is used by local Jenkins communities for\n<a href=\"/projects/jam/\">CI/CD and Jenkins Area Meetups</a>.\nLast but not least, the Jenkins community is also represented at virtual conferences where CDF has a booth.\nAll of that helps to grow Jenkins visibility and to highlight new features and initiatives in the project.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"why-did-we-graduate\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-did-we-graduate\"></a>Why did we graduate?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"imageblock right\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/logos/graduation/graduation.png\" alt=\"Jenkins Graduation Logo\" width=\"224px\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins project has a long history of open governance which is a key part of today&#8217;s project success.\nStarting from <strong>2011</strong>, the project has introduced <a href=\"/project/governance-meeting/\">the governance meeting</a> which are open to anyone.\nMost of the discussions and decision making happen publicly in the <a href=\"/mailing-lists/\">mailing lists</a>.\n<strong>In 2015</strong> we introduced teams, sub-projects and officer roles.\n<strong>In 2017</strong> we introduced the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep\">Jenkins Enhancement Proposal</a> process which helped us to make the key architecture and governance decisions more open and transparent to the community and the Jenkins users.\n<strong>In 2018</strong> we introduced <a href=\"/sigs\">special interest groups</a> that focus on community needs.\n<strong>In 2019</strong> we have <a href=\"/blog/2019/12/16/board-election-results/\">expanded the Jenkins governance board</a>\nso that it got more bandwidth to facilitate initiatives in the project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Since the Jenkins project inception 15 years ago, it has been steadily growing.\nNow it has millions of users and thousands of contributors.\nIn 2019 it has seen <strong>5,433 contributors</strong> from 111 countries and 272 companies,\n67 core and 2,654 plugin releases,\n45,484 commits, 7,000+ pull requests.\nIn 2020 Q2 the project has seen <strong>21% growth</strong> in pull requests numbers compared to 2019 Q2, bots excluded.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>One may say that the Jenkins project already has everything needed to succeed.\nIt is a result of continuous work by many community members,\nand this work will never end as long as the project remains active.\nLike in any other industry, the CI/CD ecosystem changes every day and sets new expectations from the automation tools in this domain.\nJust as the tools evolve, open source communities need to evolve so that they can address expectations, and onboard more users and contributors.\nThe CDF graduation process helped us to discover opportunities for improvement,\nand address them.\nWe reviewed the project processes and compared them with the Graduated Project criteria defined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/blob/master/PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md\">CDF project lifecycle</a>.\nBased on this review, we made changes in our processes and documentation.\nIt should improve the experience of Jenkins users,\nand help to make the Jenkins community more welcoming to existing and newcomer contributors.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div

roadmap</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>We introduced a new <a href=\"/project/roadmap/\">public roadmap</a> for the Jenkins project.\nThis roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.\nIt makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters,\nand at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.\nThe roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in jep:14[].</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>More details about the public roadmap are coming next week, stay tuned for a separate blogpost.\nOn July 10th we had an online contributor meetup about the roadmap\nand you can find more information in its

href=\"/project/adopters\">list of Jenkins adopters</a> was introduced on jenkins.io.\nThis list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,\nincluding ones

certification.\nThis certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices\nand to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).\nIt also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.\nDetails are on the <a href=\"https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3538\">Jenkins core page</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/project/conduct/\">Jenkins Code of Conduct was updated</a>\nto the new version of Contributor Covenant.\nIn particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The default <a

Core <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/docs/MAINTAINERS.adoc\">maintainer guide</a> was updated to include maintenance and issues triage guidelines.\nIt should help us to
