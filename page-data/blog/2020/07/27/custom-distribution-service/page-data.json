This blog post will summarize the work done till the midterm of the coding phases i.e. week 6. If some of the topics here require a more detailed explanation, I will write a separate blog post. These blogs posts will not have a very defined format but would cover all of the user stories or features implemented.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"project-summary\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#project-summary\"></a>Project Summary</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The main idea behind the project is to build a customizable jenkins distribution service that could be used to build tailor-made jenkins distributions. The service would provide users with a simple interface to select the configurations they want to build the instance with eg: plugins, authorization matrices etc. Furthermore it would include a section for sharing community created distros so that users can find and download already built jenkins war/configuration files to use out of the box.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"quick-review\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#quick-review\"></a>Quick review</h3>\n<table class=\"tableblock frame-all grid-all\" style=\"width: 25%;\">\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 83.3333%;\">\n<col style=\"width: 16.6667%;\">\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tableblock halign-left valign-top\"><p class=\"tableblock\">Pull Requests Opened</p></td>\n<td class=\"tableblock halign-center valign-top\"><p class=\"tableblock\">38</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tableblock halign-left valign-top\"><p class=\"tableblock\">Github Issues completed</p></td>\n<td class=\"tableblock halign-center valign-top\"><p class=\"tableblock\">36</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"details\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#details\"></a>Details</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I have written separate blog posts for every week in GSoC and the intricate details for each of them can be found at their respective blog pages.

I realised some of the blockages I might face early on, and therefore it gave me more clarity in terms of how I can proceed. I also spent this time preparing a design document which you can find <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ujWVJ2a5VYkUF6UA7m4bEpSDxmb3mJZhCbmoKO716U/edit\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://sladyn98.netlify.app/blog/community_bonding/\">Community Bonding Blog</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"week-1\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#week-1\"></a>Week 1</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In week one, I spent time getting used to the tech stack I would be using, I was pretty familiar with Spring Boot but React was something I was going to be using for the first time, so I spent time studying more about it. I also got the project page ready, the issues I was going to tackle and the milestones that I had to achieve before the evaluation. I also spent a bit of time setting up the home page and a bit of front-end components.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://sladyn98.netlify.app/blog/gsoc_week1/\">Week 1 Blog</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"week-2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#week-2\"></a>Week 2</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Once we were done with the initial setup, it was time to work on the core of the project.\nIn the second week, I worked on generating the package configuration and the plugin list dummy display page setup.\nI also ran into issues with the Jenkinsfile so the majority of time was spent fixing it.\nFinally I managed to get around those problems.\nYou can read more about it in the <a href=\"https://sladyn98.netlify.app/blog/gsoc_week2/\">Week 2 Blog post</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://sladyn98.netlify.app/blog/gsoc_week2/\">Week 2 Blog</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"week-3\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#week-3\"></a>Week 3</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The last week was spent cleaning up most of the code and getting the remaining milestones in. This was probably the hardest part of phase 1 because it involved connecting the front and back end of the project.You can read more about it here.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://sladyn98.netlify.app/blog/gsoc_week3/\">Week 3</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"midterm-update\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#midterm-update\"></a>Midterm Update</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The second phase has been going on for the past 3 weeks and we have already accomplished a majority of the deliverables including community configurations, war downloading and filtering of plugins.
