the project from creating a new Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins based on <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/\">JMH</a>,\ncreated benchmarks and achieved a 3501% improvement on some real-world scenarios.\nThen he went further and created a new <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/folder-auth\">Folder-based Authorization Strategy Plugin</a> which offers even better performance for Jenkins instances where permissions are scoped to folders.\nDuring his project Abhyudaya also fixed the Jenkins Configuration-as-Code support in Role Strategy and

class=\"anchor\" href=\"#running-the-gsoc-program-at-our-organization-level\"></a>Running the GSoC program at our organization level</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Here are some of the things our organization did before and during GSoC behind the scenes.\nTo prepare for the influx of students, we updated all our GSoC pages and wrote down all the knowledge we accumulated over the years of running the program.\nWe started preparing in October 2018, long before the official start of the program.\nThe main objective was to address the feedback we got during GSoC 2018 retrospectives.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Project ideas</strong>.\nWe started gathering project ideas in the last months of 2018.\nWe prepared a <a href=\"/projects/gsoc/2019/project-ideas/\">list of project ideas</a> in a Google doc, and we tracked ownership of each project in a table of that document.\nEach project idea was further elaborated in its own Google doc.\nWe find that when projects get complicated during the definition phase, perhaps they are really too complicated and should not be done.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Since we wanted all the project ideas to be documented the same way, we created a template to guide the contributors.\nMost of the project idea documents were written by org admins or mentors, but occasionally a student proposed a genuine idea.\nWe also captured contact information in that document such as GitHub and Gitter handles, and a preliminary list of potential mentors for the project.\nWe embedded all the project documents on our website.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Mentor and student guidelines</strong>.\nWe updated the <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/mentors/\">mentor information</a> page with details on what we expect mentors to do during the program,\nincluding the number of hours that are expected from mentors,\nand we even have a section on preventing <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/mentors/#conflict-of-interest-prevention\">conflict of interest</a>.\nWhen we recruit mentors, we point them to the mentor information page.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We also updated the <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/\">student information page</a>.\nWe find this is a huge time saver as every student contacting us has the same questions about joining and participating in the program.\nInstead of re-explaining the program each time, we send them a link to those pages.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Application phase</strong>.\nStudents started to reach out very early on as well, many weeks before GSoC officially started.\nThis was very motivating.\nSome students even started to work on project ideas before the official start of the program.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Project selection</strong>. This year the org admin team had some very difficult decisions to make.\nWith lots of students, lots of projects and lots of mentors, we had to request the right number of slots and try to match the projects with the most chances of success.\nWe were trying to form mentor teams at the same time as we were requesting the number of slots, and it was hard to get responses from all mentors in time for the deadline.\nFinally we requested fewer slots than we could have filled.\nWhen we request slots, we submit two numbers: a minimum and a maximum. The <a href=\"https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/selecting-a-student#googles-selection-process\">GSoC guide</a> states that:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The minimum is based on the projects that are so amazing they really want to see these projects occur over the summer,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and the maximum number should be the number of solid and amazing projects they wish to mentor over the summer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We were awarded minimum. So we had to make very hard decisions: we had to decide between \"amazing\" and \"solid\" proposals.\nFor some proposals, the very outstanding ones, it’s easy.\nBut for the others, it’s hard.\nWe know we cannot make the perfect decision, and by experience, we know that some students or some mentors will not be able to complete the program due to uncontrollable life events, even for the outstanding proposals.\nSo we have to make the best decision knowing that some of our choices won&#8217;t complete the program.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Community Bonding</strong>.\nWe have found that the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/glossary#community_bonding_period\">community bonding phase</a> was crucial to the success of each project.\nUsually projects that don’t do well during community bonding have difficulties later on.\nIn order to get students involved in the community better, almost all projects were handled under the umbrella of <a href=\"/sigs\">Special Interest Groups</a> so that there were more stakeholders and communications.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Communications</strong>.\nEvery year we have students who contact mentors via personal messages.\nStudents, if you are reading this, please do <strong>NOT</strong> send us personal messages about the projects, you will not receive any preferential treatment.\nObviously, in open source we want all discussions to be public, so students have to be reminded of that regularly.\nIn 2019 we are using Gitter chat for most communications, but from an admin point of view this is more fragmented than mailing lists.\nIt is also harder to search.\nChat rooms are very convenient because they are focused, but from an admin point of view, the lack of threads in Gitter makes it hard to get an overview.\nGitter threads were added recently (Nov 2019) but do not yet work well on Android and iOS.\nWe adopted Zoom Meetings towards the end of the program and we are finding it easier to work with than Google Hangouts.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Status tracking</strong>.\nAnother thing that was hard was to get an overview of how all the projects were doing once they were running.\nWe made extensive use of Google sheets to track lists of projects and participants during the program\nto rank projects and to track statuses of project phases (community bonding, coding, etc.).\nIt is a challenge to keep these sheets up to date, as each project involves several people and several links.\nWe have found it time consuming and a bit hard to keep these sheets up to date, accurate and complete, especially up until the start of the coding phase.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Perhaps some kind of objective tracking tool would help.\nWe used Jenkins Jira for tracking projects, with each phase representing a separate sprint.\nIt helped a lot for successful projects.\nIn our organization, we try to get everyone to beat the deadlines by a couple of days, because we know that there might be events such as power outages,\nbad weather (happens even in Seattle!), or other uncontrolled interruptions, that might interfere with submitting project data.\nWe also know that when deadlines coincide with weekends, there is a risk that people may forget.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Retrospective</strong>.\nAt the end of our project, we also held a retrospective and captured some ideas for the future.\nYou can find the notes <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qWeuQzMr1lGQUuirgorODwvqEXYH7RiyKkRByIed9co/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.\nWe already addressed

year, we collected all the mailing addresses we could and sent to everyone we could the 15-year Jenkins special edition T-shirt, and some stickers.\nThis was a great feel good moment.\nI want to
