class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If this section seems to be too long for you, here is some infographic prepared by <a href=\"https://github.com/tracymiranda\">Tracy Miranda</a>.\nAs you may see, Jenkins is pretty big :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2020/01-new-year-blogpost/jenkins_stats_2019.png\" alt=\"Jenkins 2019 in numbers\" height=\"512\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Community</strong>.\nOver the past year we had <strong>5433</strong> contributors in GitHub repositories (committers, reviewers, issue submitters, etc.).\nWe had <strong>1892</strong> unique committers who created <strong>7122</strong> pull requests and <strong>45484</strong> commits, bots excluded.\nContributors represent <strong>273</strong> companies and <strong>111</strong> countries, 8% of contributors are recognized as independent.\nThe most active repositories were Jenkins Core and jenkins.io.\nThe most active month was October 2019 when we reached the record high number of contributions: <strong>915</strong> unique contributors, <strong>124</strong> of them were first-timers, thanks to <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest/\">Hacktoberfest</a>!.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Jenkins core</strong>.\nIn 2019 Jenkins core had <strong>54</strong> weekly and <strong>13</strong> LTS releases with several hundreds of notable fixes/enhancements.\nThere was a login screen extensibility rework, many update manager and administrative monitors improvements.\nWe also introduced support for user timezones, not speaking of emojis support ðŸ¥³.\nThere was also a lot of housekeeping work: better APIs, codebase refresh, cleaning up static analysis warnings and removing deprecated features like Remoting CLI.\nThe core&#8217;s components also got major updates.\nOnly <a href=\"/projects/remoting/\">Jenkins Remoting</a> got <strong>11</strong> releases with stability improvements and new features like support of inbound connections to headless Jenkins controllers.\nThere are also major incoming features like jep:222[WebSocket Services support], UI look&amp;feel updates, jira:JENKINS-12548[Readonly system configuration support], Docker images for new platforms like Arm.\nTo facilitate further changes we created a new <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/jenkinsci-dev/0sdrcSOQW64/tD-IKDTsBQAJ\">Core pull request reviewers team</a> and added <strong>9</strong> contributors there.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Plugins</strong>.\nThere were <strong>2654</strong> plugin releases, and <strong>157</strong> NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.\nJenkins ecosystem got a lot of new integrations with Development and DevOps tools.\nAlso, warm welcome back to the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/scriptler\">Scriptler Plugin</a> which was depublished in 2017 due to security issues.\nIf you are afraid about such plugin numbers and dependency management, there is a new <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool\">Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool</a> which should help Jenkins users to manage plugins more efficiently.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Security</strong>.\nIt was a hot year for the <a href=\"/security/\">Jenkins Security Team</a>.\nThere were <strong>5</strong> <a href=\"/security/advisories/\">security advisories</a> for the core and <strong>20</strong> - for plugins.\nIn total we disclosed <strong>288</strong> vulnerabilities across the project, including some backlog cleaning for unmaintained plugins.\n<a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security\">Script Security Plugin</a> was the hottest plugin with <strong>10</strong> critical fixes addressing various sandbox bypass vulnerabilities.\nPlain text storage and unprotected credentials were the most popular vulnerability type <strong>120</strong> disclosures in 2019.\nIt was made possible by hundreds of reports submitted by contributors after code surveys,\nspecial thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/woodspeed\">Viktor Gazdag</a> who reported the most of the issues and became the Jenkins 2019 Security MVP (check out his story <a href=\"/blog/2019/11/29/do-plugins-store-credentials-in-a-secure-way/\">here</a>).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>.\nGot Jenkins? If so, you rely on Jenkins update centers, website and issue tracker.\nAll these and many other services are maintained by the <a href=\"/projects/infrastructure/\">Jenkins Infrastructure Team</a>.\nThis year the team handled <strong>more than 400</strong> requests in the bugtracker, and many other informal requests.\nIn total, more than <strong>30</strong> people contributed to Jenkins infrastructure this year (website content is excluded).\nWe also deployed <strong>4</strong> new services, migrated <strong>7</strong> services from Azure Container Service to Azure Kubernetes Service and updated many other services.\nMore changes will happen in the next months, and we are looking for <a href=\"/projects/infrastructure/#team\">new INFRA team members</a>!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Documentation</strong>.\nOnly last quarter we had <strong>178</strong> contributors to Jenkins documentation. It includes jenkins.io and other documentation hosted on GitHub, Wiki is not included.\nThere is also ongoing migration plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub (<a href=\"link:/blog/2019/10/21/plugin-docs-on-github/\">announcement</a>).\nSince the beginning of the project in Sep 2019, more than <strong>150</strong> plugin were migrated, and they got significant documentation revamp during the migration.\nYou can see the current status <a href=\"https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/progress\">here</a>.\nWe also work on introducing changelog automation in the project.\n<strong>123</strong> plugins have already adopted the new <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.adoc\">changelog tools</a>, powered by Release Drafter.\nAlso, we had more than <strong>60</strong> technical <a href=\"/blog\">blog posts</a> published on jenkins.io.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Configuration as Code</strong> was one of the most popular areas this year.\n<a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code\">Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin</a> had more than <strong>30</strong> releases with new features and bug fixes.\nMore than <strong>50</strong> plugins have been also updated in order to offer better configuration-as-code support.\nAs a result, the JCasC Plugin got massive adoption this year (from <strong>2000</strong> to almost <strong>8000</strong> installations),\nand now it becomes a de-facto standard for managing Jenkins as code.\nThis year we also ran our very first <a href=\"https://communitybridge.org/\">CommunityBridge</a> project devoted to <a href=\"/projects/jcasc/dev-tools/\">JCasC Schema validation and developer tools</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Events and outreach programs</strong>.\nIn 2019 we participated in multiple conferences, including FOSDEM, DevOps World | Jenkins World, SCALE.\nMore than <strong>40</strong> Jenkins Area Meetups were organized across the world, and there were many other meetups devoted to Jenkins.\nWe also kept expanding our <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/outreach-programs/\">outreach programs</a>.\nIn total we had <strong>12</strong> students who participated in <a href=\"/projects/gsoc/2019/\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2019/09/23/outreachy-audit-log-release/\">Outreachy</a> and newly introduced <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/outreach-programs/#community-bridge\">Community Bridge</a>.\nWe also had the biggest ever <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest/\">Hacktoberfest</a> with <strong>664</strong> pull requests and <strong>102</strong> participants.\nThese outreach programs help us to deliver new features in Jenkins.\nFor example, this year we added <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-branch-sourcep\">Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab</a> and a new <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool\">Plugin Installation Manager Tool</a> during GSoC,\nand Outreachy resulted in a new <a href=\"/blog/2019/09/23/outreachy-audit-log-release/\">Audit Log Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Where did we get those stats?\nGitHub stats came from the <a href=\"https://devstats.cd.foundation/\">CDF DevStats</a> service.\nThese stats include all repositories in the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci\">jenkinsci organization</a> and most popular repositories in <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra\">jenkins-infra</a>, Jenkins X and other organizations/repositories within the project are not included.\nOther stats came from <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTeUXM75UR8m_v5FbldYYNXeVW0CtXkpRydMRvQjBuew2vRyC4cjgLMSUEVNoonfYbKDSbOvasHPpxg\">project reports</a>, component changelogs, <a

class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Year 2020 will be pretty busy for the Jenkins project.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want the project to succeed.\nAs it was written <a href=\"/blog/2019/12/16/board-election-results/#whats-next-for-the-board\">Board elections blogpost</a>,\nthere are many areas to consider: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nIn the coming months there will be a lot of discussions in <a href=\"/mailing-lists/\">mailing lists</a> and <a href=\"/sigs/\">special interest groups</a>,\nand we invite all teams to work on their roadmaps and to communicate them in the community.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Next month we will participate in <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2020/\">FOSDEM</a>, and there will be a Jenkins stand there.\nOn January 31st we will also host a traditional <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/267684785/\">contributor summit in Brussels</a>,\nwhere we will

href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/PUgV5xxHMwgp\">this thread</a> for more information.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We also plan to continue all outreach programs.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas (<a href=\"/blog/2019/12/20/call-for-mentors/\">announcement</a>),\nand we will be also interested to consider non-coding projects as a part of other programs like CommunityBridge.\nWe also work on improving <a href=\"/participate/\">contribution guidelines</a> for newcomers and expert contributors.\nIf you are interested, please contact the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2
