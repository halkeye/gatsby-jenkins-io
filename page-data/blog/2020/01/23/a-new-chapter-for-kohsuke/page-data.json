To infinity and beyond!!</p>\n</div>","id":"b56c3926-16c3-522f-ae8f-4b714de4beff","title":"A new chapter for Kohsuke","date":"2020-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2020/01/23/a-new-chapter-for-kohsuke/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2020/01/29/gsoc-report/","previous":"/blog/2020/01/10/fosdem-is-coming/","id":"b56c3926-16c3-522f-ae8f-4b714de4beff"}},
