Or if you do Selenium testing, you might add browser names as labels to indicate which agent has which browser available.\n\nWith such set up, you then specify that such and such jobs can be only run on such and such labels. For example, you might say your “test-foo” job requires the “windows” label, while your “compile-bar” job might require the “macos” label.\nStarting 1.372, Hudson now lets you use boolean expressions here, instead of just specifying one label as the requirement. For example, your “seleniumTest-zot” job can now say it requires “windows&&firefox” since it’s meant to run on Windows with Firefox. Or if your job requires a shell script, you might say “!windows” to indicate that it has to be run somewhere that’s not Windows.\n\nLabels are also often used in the context of the multi-configuration project (a.k.a. matrix project.) In a multi-configuration project, you specify what to execute to build your project, then specify a number of “axes” that represents the variable and their possible values to execute a build. There are several different kinds of axes (and this is of course extensible), and one of them is the label axis.\n\nFor example, say you have a test suite that you want to run on Windows, Linux, and Solaris, to make sure it works correctly under all these environments. In such a case, you define one label axis, and tell Hudson that you have three possible values “windows”, “linux”, and “solaris.” When you build this project, Hudson will run your build three times by finding appropriate agent that carries the specified label.\n\nIn 1.373, you can now specify multiple label axes. For example, you might have a C++ project that needs to be compiled on various platforms. In such a case, you can define one label axis to be “windows”, “linux”, “solaris”, and you can define another label axis to be “32bit” and “64bit”. This will generate 3x2=6 combinations to be executed.\n\nSometimes the exhaustive combinations do not make sense. In such a case, you can use a filter boolean expression to eliminate some values. You can also use the same mechanism to create a sparse matrix — that is, you tell Hudson to reduce the coverage to 33%, and Hudson will eliminate every 2 out of 3 combinations.\n\nFinally, I’d like to thank Sandia National Laboratories for sponsoring this work, which made it possible for InfraDNA to provide this feature to the community. People often think that contributing code is the only way to give back to the project, but sponsoring features like this is another great way to do it.","title":"Recent label and matrix project improvement","tags":["development","core","tutorial"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"5b8f7dab-40ba-5e57-9d6a-7185e39ffb1a","slug":"/blog/2010/09/01/copenhagen-hudson-user-meetup/","strippedHtml":"September is turning into a meetup month for the Hudson community.

I see this as yet another validation to Hudson, and as such, I welcome this new addition to the community and wish them well! — more companies betting on Hudson means we’ll get more investment to the project, which is all goodness for Hudson users. It’s been 5 months since I left Oracle to start InfraDNA, and I was initially worried about a possible negative impact on adoption, but instead Hudson has shown with no sign of slowing down (see picture on the right, from Andrew’s report, which shows # of estimated active installations that participates to our usage stats survey). And InfraDNA is going well too - we’ve helped companies big and small to improve their Hudson usage/adoption, and our commercial value-add Hudson distribution is getting plenty of interest.\n\nHosted Hudson offers an interesting trade-off, compared to on-premises Hudson. On the plus side, given the current hourly pricing of public clouds like EC2 and Rackspace, you get a better pricing model, as CloudBees charge by minutes. You also get rid of machines and upfront cost, which is great for small business. On top of that, you can also expect them to gradually develop more value-adds and better integration to various other pieces, which can get really interesting.\n\nOn the down side, you have less control over the environment that runs the builds, and you do not have access back to your intranet environment (think databases that you need to talk to, for example.) Also, in the current pricing (8.5 cents/hour of EC2 vs 1 cent/minute of CB), if your build takes longer than 9 minutes, you’ll save more by just using Hudson EC2 plugin.\n\nOn a related note, I think one of the sweet spots is Hudson that’s well integrated with on-premises cloud solution. As you can see in the discussion with Liferay Hudson setup, with sufficient load it gets cheaper to have your own hardware, and many companies need some degree of control to the build/test environment that matches with their production environment. Plus with those on-premises virtualized environments, you can do snapshots and forks, which can be made to do very interesting things.\n\nFinally, I think the part that everyone can agree on is that the elasticity of build environment is hugely useful to the CI environment, as I discussed in my JavaOne 2009 talk ( slides.) I’m very happy to see that the foundation work we’ve made in Hudson for this is getting validated more and more, and I think the added elasticity will drive a lot more changes in Hudson and more broadly into the way we develop software.
