While Digg has been\nthe source of some controversy and press due to their recent redesign and corporate\nshake-ups, as far as the Hudson community goes they’ve been largely responsible for\na great case study on continuous deployment using Hudson and Gerrit. image:https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5005123971_403f24733d.jpg\n\nAttendees included all of InfraDNA (Kohsuke and Kedar), some folks from CloudBees, a\nnumber of local users/developers like LewisHam and myself, and\nto top off the list a couple Oracle employees including Winston Prakash who is now hacking on Hudson inside of Oracle.\n\nAs folks started arriving there was a lot of discussion around \"Hudson at Scale\", specifically\nregarding Hudson \"in the cloud\". We also got to hear about one of the most interesting Hudson\nuse-cases I’ve ever seen by Edward M. Goldberg who I’ll post an\ninterview with shortly, imagine using Hudson with thousands of machines, it’s that interesting.\n\nThrough the afternoon there were a number of great discussions concerning Hudson stability,\nengaging more of the community and nitty-gritty details regarding Hudson’s internals such\nas the plugin API.\n\nI’ve posted photos from the event on\nFlickr for posterity in case you’re interested. Overall I’d judge the meetup to be a success, it was a\nlot of fun and a great way to spend a Sunday with Hudson.\n\nIf you’re going to be at JavaOne, come track me down and let’s talk about Hudson, if you’re not in San Francisco for the event, you can always follow my updates on Twitter or hit up Flickr","title":"Pre-JavaOne Hudson Meetup Redux","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Or if you do Selenium testing, you might add browser names as labels to indicate which agent has which browser available.\n\nWith such set up, you then specify that such and such jobs can be only run on such and such labels. For example, you might say your “test-foo” job requires the “windows” label, while your “compile-bar” job might require the “macos” label.\nStarting 1.372, Hudson now lets you use boolean expressions here, instead of just specifying one label as the requirement. For example, your “seleniumTest-zot” job can now say it requires “windows&&firefox” since it’s meant to run on Windows with Firefox. Or if your job requires a shell script, you might say “!windows” to indicate that it has to be run somewhere that’s not Windows.\n\nLabels are also often used in the context of the multi-configuration project (a.k.a. matrix project.) In a multi-configuration project, you specify what to execute to build your project, then specify a number of “axes” that represents the variable and their possible values to execute a build. There are several different kinds of axes (and this is of course extensible), and one of them is the label axis.\n\nFor example, say you have a test suite that you want to run on Windows, Linux, and Solaris, to make sure it works correctly under all these environments. In such a case, you define one label axis, and tell Hudson that you have three possible values “windows”, “linux”, and “solaris.” When you build this project, Hudson will run your build three times by finding appropriate agent that carries the specified label.\n\nIn 1.373, you can now specify multiple label axes. For example, you might have a C++ project that needs to be compiled on various platforms. In such a case, you can define one label axis to be “windows”, “linux”, “solaris”, and you can define another label axis to be “32bit” and “64bit”. This will generate 3x2=6 combinations to be executed.\n\nSometimes the exhaustive combinations do not make sense. In such a case, you can use a filter boolean expression to eliminate some values. You can also use the same mechanism to create a sparse matrix — that is, you tell Hudson to reduce the coverage to 33%, and Hudson will eliminate every 2 out of 3 combinations.\n\nFinally, I’d like to thank Sandia National Laboratories for sponsoring this work, which made it possible for InfraDNA to provide this feature to the community. People often think that contributing code is the only way to give back to the project, but sponsoring features like this is another great way to do it.","title":"Recent label and matrix project improvement","tags":["development","core","tutorial"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"5b8f7dab-40ba-5e57-9d6a-7185e39ffb1a","slug":"/blog/2010/09/01/copenhagen-hudson-user-meetup/","strippedHtml":"September is turning into a meetup month for the Hudson community.

I think the event will be fun.\n\nIf you plan on coming, please drop me a note, so that we can get some sense of the attendance.\n\nWhen: September 6th, 18:30\n\nWhere: Auditorium 1, Nokia Denmark A/S, København ( map)\n\nFood will be provided.","title":"Copenhagen Hudson User Meetup","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":712,"numPages":101,"currentPage":90}},
