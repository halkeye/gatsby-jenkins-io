We have finalized most of the dates and locations for the 2015 Jenkins User Conference (JUC) World Tour.\n\n+\n+\n\nSave the date(s):\n\n+\n+\n\nUS East (Washington DC): June 18-19\n\nEurope (London): June 23-24\n\nIsrael: July 16 (ETA)\n\nUS West (Santa Clara): September 2-3\n\n+\n+\n\nThe big news? The JUC agenda has been expanded this year to cover two days! That means you get twice as many opportunities to learn how others are using Jenkins and to network with other Jenkins users.\n\n+\n+\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS IS OPEN FOR ALL JUC CONFERENCES\n\n+\n+\n\nWe need JUC speakers! The Call for Papers is open now and you can apply here. This is an opportunity for YOU to give back to the community by sharing your Jenkins knowledge and success. Jenkins speakers contribute significantly to the overall JUC experience.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn return for speaking, you will receive free admission to the conference and fame/fortune within the Jenkins community. OK, we can’t guarantee the latter, but we can guarantee the former! Hurry and apply now, because the Call for Papers deadline for US East and Europe expires on March 22, 2015.\n\n+\n+\n\nNot interested in speaking? Another way to contribute to the community is by letting us know who you want to hear from. Nominate or refer that amazing speaker and we’ll do the rest. Contact alytong13@gmail.com\n\n+\n+\n\nJUC SPONSORSHIPS\n\n+\n+\n\nLastly, be a JUC sponsor. Any organization can do this – whether a vendor that sells into the Jenkins ecosystem or a company that has received value from Jenkins and wants to give back to the community. You can find out more here. (NOTE: JUC is not a moneymaking venture for the community – so sponsorships do make a difference.)","title":"Jenkins User Conference – Save the Date","tags":["general","meetup","news","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/8d248/alyssat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/c004c/alyssat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/9e67b/alyssat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/22924/alyssat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/89767/alyssat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/40d97/alyssat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/5028e/alyssat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":166}}},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"/blog/authors/alyssat","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"1c1ae65c-aeae-5855-bc4e-cc4d328eb58f","slug":"/blog/2015/02/25/100k-celebration-podcast/","strippedHtml":"+\nAs a part of https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-celebration-day-february-26[the Jenkins 100K celebration], Dean Yu, Andrew Bayer, R.

Post your blog and Tweet out a link to it. Include the hashtag #Jenkins100K in your post.\n\nOn February 26, we will hold a raffle and pick four names at random. The grand prize winner will get a 3D Jenkins Butler model. Five others will get their pick of Jenkins swag (up to $20) from the Jenkins online store.\n\nOTHER WAYS TO CELEBRATE\n\nThere are a number of other things planned and we want YOU to be involved. This blog post is the central place to come for all things related to the celebration.\n\nRecording – Jenkins Governance Board\nDean, Tyler, Andrew and I will get together this month and record some thoughts about the Jenkins project. We will share that recording with you from this page on February 26.\n\nTwitter Badge\nFor those of us on social media that want to proudly celebrate our community, we will have a special badge that you can use for your profile image on Twitter or any of the other social media forums. Feel free to use the badge as long as you want – but let’s get as many of us using it as possible between now and February 27.\n\nSocial Media Images\n\nCloudBees is donating a series of images that we can all push out on social media (whatever platform(s) you use).\n\nPick your favorite(s) and push them out on Twitter, Facebook, G+\n\nCertificate (available on this blog post soon)\nDownload your very own “I am part of the Jenkins 100K” certificate.

Full service. As your right arm, Jenkins is the reliable and trustworthy guy you want on your team! +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nhttps://ow.ly/FdEBD[Check out the contest rules] and participate. Let's raise the visibility of Jenkins and have some fun in the process! +\n +\n\nRead Sacha’s blog\n\nLearn more about the contest and how to win Jenkins prizes\n\nGo directly to the #BreakingBuilds images\n\n+","title":"#BreakingBuilds","tags":["general","just for fun","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":528,"numPages":101,"currentPage":67}},
