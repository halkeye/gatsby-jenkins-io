GitHub Check Run Screenshot from GitHub Docs\n\nWhat’s more exciting is that it can leave annotations on specific lines of code, just as the comments people left while reviewing.\n\nFigure 2. Check Run Annotation Screenshot from GitHub Docs\n\nWhile on Jenkins' side, the source code view provided by Warnings Next Generation Plugin does pretty much the same thing.\n\nFigure 3. Source Code View from Warnings Next Generation Plugin\n\nUtilizing such features through GitHub Checks API, it would make Jenkins more convenient to GitHub users.\n\nFeatures from Coding Phase 1\n\nIn the past month, our team was mostly working on the general checks API and an implementation for GitHub checks API.\n\nGitHub Checks API Plugin Demo [starts from 50:15]\n\nGeneral Checks API\n\nAlthough the general checks API is developed based on the semantic meaning of GitHub Checks API, we still want to prepare it for similar concepts on other platforms like Commit Status API from GitLab.\nContributions for implementations on these platforms will be welcomed in the future.\n\nGitHub Checks API Implementation\n\nOur work on supporting GitHub Checks API is mostly done by now.\nBesides, we implemented a consumer to automatically create a check run that simply indicates the current stage of a Jenkins build.\nAfter the release, Jenkins developers (especially publisher plugin ones) can create their own GitHub checks for a GitHub branch source project by consuming our API.\n\nExample: To create a check run like:\n\nConsumers need to use our API in this way:\n\nChecksDetails details = new ChecksDetailsBuilder()\n        .withName(\"Jenkins\")\n        .withStatus(ChecksStatus.COMPLETED)\n        .withDetailsURL(\"https://ci.jenkins.io\")\n        .withStartedAt(LocalDateTime.now(ZoneOffset.UTC))\n        .withCompletedAt(LocalDateTime.now(ZoneOffset.UTC))\n        .withConclusion(ChecksConclusion.SUCCESS)\n        .withOutput(new ChecksOutputBuilder()\n                .withTitle(\"Jenkins Check\")\n                .withSummary(\"# A Successful Build\")\n                .withText(\"## 0 Failures\")\n                .withAnnotations(Arrays.asList(\n                        new ChecksAnnotationBuilder()\n                                .withPath(\"Jenkinsfile\")\n                                .withLine(1)\n                                .withAnnotationLevel(ChecksAnnotationLevel.NOTICE)\n                                .withMessage(\"say hello to Jenkins\")\n                                .withStartColumn(0)\n                                .withEndColumn(20)\n                                .withTitle(\"Hello Jenkins\")\n                                .withRawDetails(\"a simple echo command\")\n                                .build(),\n                        new ChecksAnnotationBuilder()\n                                .withPath(\"Jenkinsfile\")\n                                .withLine(2)\n                                .withAnnotationLevel(ChecksAnnotationLevel.WARNING)\n                                .withMessage(\"say hello to GitHub Checks API\")\n                                .withStartColumn(0)\n                                .withEndColumn(30)\n                                .withTitle(\"Hello GitHub Checks API\")\n                                .withRawDetails(\"a simple echo command\")\n                                .build()))\n                .build())\n        .withActions(Collections.singletonList(\n                new ChecksAction(\"formatting\", \"format code\", \"#0\")))\n        .build();\n\nChecksPublisher publisher = ChecksPublisherFactory.fromRun(run);\npublisher.publish(details);\n\nFuture Works\n\nThe next step is integrating our API into Warnings Next Generation Plugin and Code Coverage API Plugin consume our API.\nAfter that, pipeline support will be added: users can publish checks directly in a pipeline script without requiring a consumer plugin that support the checks.\n\nResources\n\nGitHub Repository\n\nProject Page\n\nGitter Channel\n\nReferences\n\nGitHub Doc: Creating CI tests with the Checks API\n\nWarnings Next Generation Plugin: Source Code View","title":"GitHub Checks API Plugin Project -

I am participating in GSoC 2020 with Jenkins.\nI am working on the Windows Service Wrapper Project.\nSo the Coding Phase 01 of GSoC 2020 is now over and this blog post describes what I have done so far.\n\nWindows Service Wrapper is an executable, which we can use to run applications as Windows Services on Windows machines, which has almost one million downloads.\nIn Jenkins, we use Windows service wrapper to run Jenkins server and agents as Windows services to gain more robustness.\nThis feature is bundled into Jenkins’s core. Currently, the Windows Service wrapper is configured by an XML file.\nHowever, there is a limited number of configuration checks and there is no XML schema.\n\nXML is not such a human-friendly way to do that. It is quite verbose and not easy to identify the schema without some effort.\nUsually, users misconfigure the service wrapper. This is a sample XML configuration file that we can use to provide configurations to Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nSample XML Configuration File\n\njenkins\nJenkins\nThis service runs Jenkins automation server.\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_201\\bin\\java.exe\n-Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle\n    -jar \"C:\\Program Files\\Jenkins\\jenkins.war\" --httpPort=8081 --webroot=\"%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinswar\"\nrotate\n\n%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinsjenkins.pid\n10000\nfalse\n\nThe usage of YAML could simplify configuration management in Jenkins, especially when automated and configuration management tools are used.\nSo what we are doing under GSoC - 2020 is to update the Windows Service Wrapper to support YAML configurations.\nAfter finishing this project, users will be able to provide configurations to the Windows Service Wrapper as a YAML file.\n\nThis is a sample YAML configuration file for Windows Service Wrapper and you can see it is less verbose than XML or JSON and much more human friendly.\nUsers can read and edit this without a big effort.\n\nSample YAML Configuration File\n\nid: jenkins\nname: Jenkins\ndescription: This service runs Jenkins automation server.\nenv:\n    _name: JENKINS_HOME\n    _value: '%LocalAppData%\\Jenkins.jenkins'\nexecutable: 'C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_201\\bin\\java.exe'\narguments: >-\n    -Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle\n    -jar \"C:\\Program Files\\Jenkins\\jenkins.war\" --httpPort=8081 --webroot=\"%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinswar\"\nlogmode: rotate\nonfailure:\n    _action: restart\nextensions:\n    -\n        pidfile: '%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinsjenkins.pid'\n        stopTimeout: '10000'\n        stopParentFirst: 'false'\n        _enabled: 'true'\n        _className: winsw.Plugins.RunawayProcessKiller.RunawayProcessKillerExtension\n        _id: killOnStartup\n\nAdvantages of YAML as a configuration file\n\nIt is less verbose and much more human friendly than XML.\n\nSince YAML is not using extra delimiters, it is lightweight.\n\nNowadays YAML has become more popular among configuration management tools.\n\nProject Scope\n\nDuring this project, I will add the following features to Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nYAML Configuration support\n\nYAML Schema validation\n\nNew CLI for the Windows Service Wrapper\n\nSupport for XML Schema validation via XML Schema Definition (XSD)\n\nPhase 01 Updates\n\nIn GSoC - 2020 phase 01, I have done the following updates to the Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nProject Structure overview document. (Published)\n\nYAML configurations support (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nNew CLI (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nXML Schema validation (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nYou can find Phase 01 Demo slides in this link.\n\nBelow you can find more details about the deliverables listed above.\n\nProject Structure overview\n\nThe project structure overview document describes how files and directories are organized in the Windows Service Wrapper project.\nIt will help contributors as well as users, to understand the codebase easily.\nAlso, it helps me a lot to understand the codebase. You can find the document from the given link.\n\nYAML configurations support\n\nAs I explained before, in this project, configurations will be provided as a YAML file.\nI used YamlDotNet library which has more than 2.2k stars on GitHub, to deserialize the YAML file into an Object graph.\nIn this YAML file, users can specify configurations in a more structured way than in XML configuration files.\nAs an example, now users can specify all the log related configurations under the log config.\nUsers can specify all service account related configurations under serviceaccount config etc.\n\nAt the moment, I am working on a design document for YAML configuration support. I will add it to the GitHub Issue once ready\n\nNew CLI\n\nBefore moving into Phase 01 updates, it’s better to explain why we needed a new CLI for Windows Service Wrapper.\nIn the early phases of Windows Service Wrapper, we will keep the XML configuration support as well.\nSo we should allow users to specify the configurations file separately.\nThe current approach is, configurations file should be in the same directory, where Windows Service Wrapper executable exists and the file name of the XML file should be the same as the Windows Service Wrapper executable file name.\nAlso, users should be able to redirect logs if they need to and they should be allowed to elevate command prompt using Windows Service Wrapper.\nAlso, we thought that it’s better to allow users to skip schema validation if they needed. So we decided to move into a new CLI.\n\nAs I explained, after releasing this, users will have options in addition to commands.\nIt will make the WinSW CLI more flexible so that we can easily extend it later. These are the options users are allowed to use.\nThese options are available with all the commands except help and version\n\n--redirect / -r [string]\n\nUsers can specify the redirect path for the logs if needed\n\nNot required | Default value is null\n\n--elevated / -e [boolean]\n\nElevate the command prompt before executing the command\n\nNot required | Default value is false\n\n--configFile / -c [string]\n\nUsers can specify the configurations file as a path\n\nNot Required | Default value is null\n\n--skipConfigValidation / -s [boolean]\n\nUsers can skip schema validation for configurations file if needed\n\nNot required | Default value is true\n\n--help / -h\n\nUser can find what options are available with a particular command with this option\n\nThis option is available with the install command\n\n--profile / -f [boolean]\n\nIf this option is true, then users can provide a service account for installation explicitly.\n\nNot required | Default value is false\n\nWe used commandlineparser/commandline library to parse the command line argument which has more than 2k stars in GitHub. At a glance, the library is compatible with .NET Framework 4.0+, Mono 2.1+ Profile, .NET Standard, and .NET Core.\n\nXML Schema validation\n\nAs I mentioned before, there was no schema validation for XML in Windows Service Wrapper.\nHence, I was working on schema validation for XML. I use XSD to validate XML files. The XSD file will be shipped as an embedded resource with the executable.\nYou can find the XSD file in my pull request.\n\nFuture updates\n\nIn the next phase, for GSoC 2020 the listed deliverables features will be released and the YAML schema validation feature will be added.\nAlso, we hope to publish a design document for the new features, which will help contributors.\n\nHow to contribute\n\nYou can find the GitHub repository in this link. Issues and Pull requests are always welcome.\nAlso, you can communicate with us in the WinSW Gitter channel, which is a great way to get in touch and there are project sync up meetings every Tuesday at 13:30 UTC on the Gitter channel.\n\nSome useful links\n\nProject Page\n\nProject Repository\n\nGitter Channel\n\nYamlDotNet library\n\nCommand Line Parser library","title":"Windows Service Wrapper : YAML Configuration Support - GSoC Phase - 01 Updates","tags":["winsw","windows","jenkins","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"buddhikac96","html":"","id":"buddhikac96","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Buddhika Chathuranga","slug":"/blog/authors/buddhikac96","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9a5f343b-e83f-526e-aab4-05c8c88ea996","slug":"/blog/2020/06/30/machine-learning-plugin-coding-phase1/","strippedHtml":"Welcome back !\n\nThis blog post is briefing my coding phase 1 in Jenkins Machine Learning Plugin for this GSoC 2020.\n\nAfter a fresh introduction of community bonding, On June 1st, coding of GSoC had started officially with phase 1. At this point, every GSoC student should be expected to have a rigid plan with their entire project. With the guidance of mentors I was able to complete a design document and timeline which can be slightly adjustable during the coding. The coding phase was more about coding and discussion.\n\nQuick review\n\nPull Requests\n21\n\nJira Issues\n11\n\nMajor Tasks\n3\n\nCompleted\n3\n\nIn progress\n0\n\nWeek 1\n\nI have to ensure that I have a solid architecture for implementing the core of this plugin such that perhaps I or future community will be able to develop R and Julia kernels for this plugin. Factory method design patterns are suitable when users need different types of products ( Python, R and Julia) without knowing much about the internal infrastructure ( Manager of these interpreters ).\n\nAll the base classes were implemented this week.\n\nDesign the Kernel connectors\n\nInitiate the interpreter\n\nClose the connection\n\nAdd simple tests\n\nUpdate pom.xml\n\nMore than these changes, repo was updated with pull request template and licence header. Readme was extended a little at the end of the week.\n\nIssues and Challenges\n\nGit rebase and squash\n\nTests invokes ipython client in the server failed during the CI build\n\nWeek 2\n\nWith the help of a design document, I had a plan to do the configurations globally and using the Abstract Folder property I could save the configuration and retrieve for the job configuartion. I used to reference some other well developed plugin for the structure of code. That helped me a lot while I was coding. Our first official contributor has popped out his pull request.\n\nForm validations and helper html will be a great help in the user point of view as well as developers. A minor bug was fixed with the guidance of mentors by writing tests with ‘Jenkins WebClient`. Until the end of the week, builder class of the plugin has been implemented with lots of research and discussion. Finally,  Test connection was added to the global configuration page to start the connection and test it. A single issue that blocked me using py4j authentication about zeppelin-python was reported in Jira.\n\nServer Configuration\n\nIssues and challenges\n\nBackend depends on Apache zeppelin-python API to connect IPython\n\nFind relevant extension points to extend the plugin\n\nWeek 3\n\nEarlier in this week, we were trying to merge our IPython builder PR without any memory leaks or bugs that will cause the system to be devastating while running this plugin. Later, this whole week I was implementing a file parser that could copy the necessary files and had the ability to accomplish the file conversion.\n\nSupported file types\n\nPython (.py)\n\nJSON (Zeppelin notebooks format)\n\nIPython builder was able to run Jupyter Notebooks and Zeppelin formatted JSON files at the end of the 3rd week. Minor issues were fixed in the code. We used ANSI color plugin to fix the abnormal view of error messages produced by the ipython kernel.\n\nCopying and converting Jupyter Notebook\n\nIssues and Challenges\n\nPython error messages could not be displayed in rich format\nIf a job is running at user level, but if the python code access file/file path which is not authorized to the user, it returns a permission denied message.\nWhile running on agent, notebook has to be written/copied to agent workspace\nArtifacts should be maintained/reachable from controller after build.\n\nWeek 4\n\nAs all the major tasks has done, the demo preparation and plan for a experimental release was carried during the last week. There were lots of research on how to connect to a existing kernel in remote. Demo and presentation were prepared along the week.\n\nIssues and Challenges\n\nReleasing the first version was bit late\n\nKnowledge transfer\n\nHow to debug the code through IntelliJ\n\nEdit configuration → Add new Configuration → Maven\n\nCommand line → type hpi:run\n\nClick the debug icon on the toolbar or go to Run menu then Debug\n\nHow to setup to test the plugin\n\nSetup JDK 8 and Maven 3.5.*\n\nCreate a directory $ mkdir machine-learning-plugin\n\nCreate a virtual environment $ virtualenv venv\n\nActivate your virtual environment $ source venv/bin/activate\n\nRun $ which python to ensure your python path\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/machine-learning-plugin.git\n\nRun $ mvn clean install from the machine-learning-plugin directory\n\nRun $ mvn hpi:run to start Jenkins with the plugin\n\nSet up the builder with localhost and other parameters\n\nCreate a job\n\nWrite python code like print(“plugin works”)\n\nBuild the job\n\nIssues and bugs\n\nJENKINS-62528 Issues on Jenkins build in the plugin repository\n\nJENKINS-62621 Global configuration for IPython servers\n\nJENKINS-62649 Implementation of IPython Builder\n\nJENKINS-62711 File parser to copy source files to workspace\n\nJENKINS-62733 Python errors are not displayed properly in console log\n\nJENKINS-62735 Send/Receive necessary files from controller/agent to agent/controller\n\nJENKINS-62593 Improve the documentation\n\nJENKINS-62742 Increase Test coverage\n\nResources and Links\n\nGithub\n\nProject page\n\nDesign document","title":"Machine Learning Plugin project - coding phase 1 blog post","tags":["machinelearning","datascience","plugins","communitybonding","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/9b030/loghijiaha.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/f38b5/loghijiaha.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/bcd2b/loghijiaha.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/ceea6/loghijiaha.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/45b82/loghijiaha.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/933cd/loghijiaha.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/6c13d/loghijiaha.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":158}}},"blog":null,"github":"loghijiaha","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Computer Science and Engineering Student at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

The fingerprint engine of Jenkins can track usages of artifacts, credentials, files, etc. within the system. Currently, it does this by maintaining a local XML-based database which leads to dependence on the physical disk of the Jenkins controller.\n\nAllowing fingerprint storage to be moved to external storages decreases the dependence of Jenkins instances on the physical disk space and also allows for tracking the flow of fingerprints across instances of Jenkins connected to the same external storage.\n\nAdvantages of using external storage drivers:\n\nRemove dependence on Jenkins controller disk storage\n\nCan configure pay-as-you-use cloud storages\n\nEasy Backup Management\n\nBetter Reliability and Availability\n\nFingerprints can be tracked across Jenkins instances\n\nAlong with this API, we are also working on a reference implementation in the form of a plugin, powered by Redis.\n\nAs phase 1 of this project comes to an end, this blog post serves as a summary of the progress we made to the entire Jenkins community.\n\nCurrent State\n\nThe new API introduced in Jenkins core is under review. Once merged, it will offer developers to extend it to build external fingerprint storage plugins.\n\nThe Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin is alpha release ready. We would immensely appreciate any feedback.\n\nExternal Fingerprint Storage Demo\n\nIntroducing the new API for plugin developers\n\nWith PR-4731, we introduce a new fingerprint storage API, allowing configuring custom storage engines.\nWe exposed the following methods in the new FingerprintStorage class:\n\nvoid save()\n\nSaves the given Fingerprint in the storage.\n\nFingerprint load(String id)\n\nReturns the Fingerprint with the given unique ID. The unique ID for a fingerprint is defined by Fingerprint#getHashString().\n\nvoid delete(String id)\n\nDeletes the Fingerprint with the given unique ID.\n\nboolean isReady()\n\nReturns true if there is some data in the fingerprint database corresponding to the particular Jenkins instance.\n\nIntroducing Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin uses the new External Fingerprint Storage API to store the fingerprints in a Redis instance.\n\nInstallation:\n\nThe alpha release (version 0.1-alpha-1) for the plugin was drafted, and can be installed using the experimental update center.\n\nFollow along the following steps after running Jenkins to download and install the plugin:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Manage Plugins\n\nGo to Advanced tab\n\nConfigure the Update Site URL as: https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/update-center.json\n\nClick on Submit, and then press the Check Now button.\n\nGo to Available tab.\n\nSearch for Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin and check the box along it.\n\nClick on Install without restart\n\nThe plugin should now be installed on your system.\n\nUsage\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, you can configure the Redis server details by following the steps below:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Configure System\n\nScroll to the section Redis Fingerprint Storage Configuration and fill in the required details:\n\nHost - Enter hostname where Redis is running\n\nPort - Specify the port on which Redis is running\n\nSSL - Click if SSL is enabled\n\nDatabase - Redis supports integer indexed databases, which can be specified here.\n\nConnection Timeout - Set the connection timeout duration in milliseconds.\n\nSocked Timeout - Set the socket timeout duration in milliseconds.\n\nCredentials - Configure authentication using username and password to the Redis instance.\n\nEnabled - Check this to enable the plugin (Note: This is likely to be removed very soon, and will be enabled by default.)\n\nUse the Test Redis Connection to verify that the details are correct and Jenkins is able to connect to the Redis instance.\n\nPress the Save button.\n\nNow, all the fingerprints produced by this Jenkins instance should be saved in the configured Redis server!\n\nFuture Work\n\nSome of the topics we aim to tackle in the next phases include extending the API, fingerprint cleanup, migrations (internal→external, external→internal, external→external), tracing, ORM, implementing the saveable listener, etc.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe Redis Fingerprint Storage plugin is built and maintained by the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Team for\nExternal Fingerprint Storage for Jenkins.\n\nSpecial thanks to Oleg Nenashev, Andrey Falko, Mike Cirioli, Jesse Glick, and the entire Jenkins community for all the contribution to this project.\n\nReaching Out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions, feedback, etc. on the project’s Gitter Channel or the Jenkins Developer Mailing list\n\nWe use Jenkins Jira to track issues.\nFeel free to file issues under redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin component.\n\nOther Links\n\nPhase 1 demo\n\nPresentation slides\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nIssue Tracker for Phase 1\n\njep:226[]\n\nGitter Channel\n\nProject Page","title":"External Fingerprint Storage Phase-1 Updates","tags":["plugins","fingerprint","cloud-native","external-storage","developer","redis","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/19e71/stellargo.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/77b35/stellargo.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/d4a57/stellargo.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/19e71/stellargo.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/ef6ff/stellargo.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/8257c/stellargo.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/6766a/stellargo.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://medium.com/@sumitsarinofficial","github":"stellargo","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2020 student.

this article, I would like to share some highlights from the User Interface track of the\nJenkins UI/UX Hackfest we held on May 25..29.\nThis blog post has been slightly delayed by the infrastructure issues we had in the project,\nbut, as for improving the Jenkins UI, it is better late than never.\nKey highlights from the event:\n\nWe delivered a preview of Jenkins read-only configuration.\nDuring the hackfest we discovered and fixed many compatibility issues.\n\nWe created a new Dark Theme for Jenkins.\nWe also improved theming support in the core, and fixed compatibility in many plugins.\n\nWe contributed to the Jenkins UI accessibility, including UX testing and fixing the reported issues.\njira:JENKINS-62437[Configuration UI: Tables to divs migration] testing was the dominant story there.\n\nWe worked on a New Script Security approvals management UI\n\nWe had 54 contributors at the hackfest.\n22 of them have contributed to the user interface track as committers, testers and reviewers:\nTim Jacomb,\nUllrich Hafner,\nRaihaan Shouhell,\nSumit Sarin,\nDaniel Beck,\nRomén Rodríguez-Gil,\nwadeck Follonier,\nRunxia Ye,\nFélix Queiruga,\nAytunc Beken,\nPeter Jonsson,\nAntonio Muniz,\nKseniia Nenasheva,\nSladyn Nuner,\nAbhyudaya Sharma,\nOleg Nenashev,\nNimish Bongale,\nEsther Álvarez Feijoo,\nDenys Digtiar,\nSlavo,\nLiam Newman, and\nGavin Mogan.\nThanks to all contributors!\n\nSee the blog post below to know more about these and other user interface improvements.\n\nRead-only Jenkins Configuration\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nfeature preview announcement,\npresentation materials\n\nA read-only view of Jenkins configurations, jobs and agents is important to Jenkins Configuration-as-Code users.\nIt would allow them to access configuration and diagnostics information about their Jenkins instances while having no opportunity to occasionally change it.\nThis story is a part of the Jenkins roadmap,\nand it was featured as an area for contribution during the UI/UX hackfest.\n\nOn May 25th we have released a preview for Read-only Jenkins Configuration.\nRead the announcement by Tim Jacomb in this blogpost.\nDuring the hackfest we kept testing the change and fixing compatibility in the Jenkins plugins,\nincluding the Cloud Stats Plugin, Role Strategy Plugin, Simple Disk Usage Plugin and others.\n\nWe would appreciate feedback and testing from the Jenkins users!\nSee the blogpost for the guidelines.\n\nDark Theme\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nproject repository\n\nDark user interface themes are very popular among developers: in IDE, communication tools, etc.\nAnd there is an interest to have one for Jenkins.\nThere were a few of implementations before the hackfest, most notably camalot/jenkins-dark-stylish and a dark version of the Neo2 Theme.\nThese themes were difficult to maintain, and finally they were either removed or abandoned.\nWhat if Jenkins had an official theme?\n\nDuring the event a group of contributors focused on creating a new Dark Theme for Jenkins.\nThis effort included:\n\nPatches to the Jenkins core which simplified development and maintenance of UI themes.\nSupport for CSS variables was added, as well as PostCSS processing which helps to simplify browser compatibility.\n\nDark Theme itself.\n\nUI Testing and compatibility fixes in the core and multiple Jenkins plugins.\n\nDark theme demo with support for the development mode.\n\nYou can try out this theme starting from Jenkins 2.239.\nIt is available as a plugin from the Jenkins Update Center.\nAn example screenshot of the main page:\n\nIf you discover any Dark theme compatibility issues,\nplease report them here.\n\nJenkins Configuration UI Accessibility\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nproject page\n\nJenkins Web UI accessibility was one of the suggested topics at the event.\nWe would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.\nIt includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.\nIn general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.\nSome of the accessibility improvements we implemented during the event:\n\nAdded aria-labels to username & password input fields\n\nIndicate the language of the page in the footer (not merged yet)\n\nRemove page generation timestamp from the footer\n\nAt the UI/UX hackfest the major focus was on migrating configuration pages from tables to divs\n(jira:JENKINS-62437[]).\nIt will make them more user-friendly on narrow and especially mobile screens.\nThe change will also help users to navigate complex forms with multiple levels of nesting.\nOur progress:\n\nUser Experience testing.\nThanks to the contributors, we discovered several compatibility issues in plugins.\n\nBug fixes in several plugins\n\nA new Dockerized demo which allows to evaluate the change with a set of pre-configured plugins.\n\nHere is an example of a job configuration page using the new layout:\n\nWe will keep working on this change in the coming weeks,\nand we invite Jenkins users and Contributors to help us with testing the change!\nTesting guidelines are available in the jira:JENKINS-62437[] ticket.\n\nNew Script Security approvals management UI\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\npull request\n\nDuring the hackfest Wadeck Follonier redesigned the script approval interface in the Script Security Plugin.\nThe new UI allows viewing the list of approved scripts, shows the last access timestamp, and allows managing the approvals individually.\nBefore, it was not possible to do it from the Web interface.\nOnce the pull request is released,\nthe feature will become available to Jenkins users.\n\nOther UI improvements\n\nIn addition to the major improvements listed above,\nthere were also many smaller patches in the Jenkins core and various plugins.\nYou can find a full list of contributions to the user interface here,\nsome important improvements:\n\nImproved navigation in the Credentials plugin.\n\nSupport for wide screens in the Autograding plugin.\n\nUI Improvements in the Folder-based Authorization Strategy plugin.\n\nImproved Fingerprint listing in the Jenkins core\n\nContributing\n\nWe invite Jenkins users and contributors to join the effort and to improve the user interface together.\nThe Jenkins project gradually adopts modern frontend stacks (JavaScript, React, Gatsby, Vue.js, etc.) and design methodologies.\nFor example, see the presentation about beautifying the UI of Jenkins reporter plugins by Ullrich Hafner.\nIt is a great opportunity for frontend developers to join the project, share their experiences, experiment with new technologies, and improve the Jenkins user interface and user experience.\nJoin us!\n\nSee this page for more information about contributing to the Jenkins codebase.\nIf you want to know more, join us in the Jenkins User Experience SIG channels.\n\nReferences\n\nYou can find more information

Jenkins project relies heavily on its infrastructure.\nWe use websites like www.jenkins.io and plugins.jenkins.io, ticketing systems like issues.jenkins.io, CI/CD infrastructure like ci.jenkins.io, and many other services.\nJust to provide some context about the Jenkins infrastructure scale, here are some stats from April 2020:\n\nOver 600 000 people visited www.jenkins.io\n\nOver 250 000 Jenkins servers regularly checked the\nJenkins package server and the\nJenkins update server\n\nOver 43 000 continuous integration jobs ran on ci.jenkins.io\n\nOver 950 plugins ran their continuous integration pipelines on ci.jenkins.io\n\nCountry by country visitors to jenkins.io\n\nThe Jenkins project, as an open source project, is built and maintained by its awesome community.\nLike in any organization, there are specific people who make sure that those services are always up and running.\nEveryone is welcome to participate.\nInfrastructure is no exception, we are always looking for new contributors to the infrastructure!\n\nWhile we can’t share publicly everything like secrets and certificates,\nwe still try to be as transparent as possible so that everybody can understand and improve our infrastructure without having privileged access.\nWhat better way than using Git to manage infrastructure work?\n\nWho said GitOps?\n\nSince the creation of the Jenkins-infra organization on GitHub in March 2008, more than 650 people have contributed to over 80 git repositories.\nThose contributions make the Jenkins community what it is today.\nIf you can’t find something there, it probably means that some help is welcomed.\n\nMore recently, with help from Gavin Mogan, Tim Jacomb, and Alex Earl, big achievements have been possible on many fronts like automating Jenkins releases, refreshing plugins.jenkins.io, adding new agents to ci.jenkins.io, and maintaining our Kubernetes cluster.\nWe thank them for their help and for the infrastructure progress they have enabled.\n\nInfrastructure at Scale\n\nRunning infrastructure at the scale the Jenkins project does is expensive and sometimes quite challenging.\nWe are fortunate enough to be supported by many leading companies that provide us their expertise, their products, and their support.\n\nRecently, Amazon Web Services donated $60 000 to run Jenkins infrastructure on the AWS cloud.\nWe’re so grateful for their donation and for the flexibility it provides.\nWe’re running Linux agents with AMD64 and ARM64 architectures on AWS.\nWe’re using AWS cloud for our Windows agents.\nThe generous infrastructure donation from Amazon Web Services has increased our continuous integration capacity and broadened our platform coverage.\n\nOur Sponsors\n\nMajor sponsors of the Jenkins infrastructure include\nCloudBees,\nOregon State University Open Source Lab,\nContinuous Delivery Foundation,\nRed Hat,\nAmazon Web Services, and\nGitHub.\n\nAdditional sponsors of Jenkins infrastructure services and software include\nAtlassian,\nDatadog,\nFastly,\nIBM.\nJFrog,\nPagerduty,\nRackspace,\nSentry,\nServerion,\nSpinUp,\nTsinghua University, and\nXMission.\n\nEach of these organizations support the Jenkins project in their own way.\nWe thank them for their contributions, their support and for their willingness to help the Jenkins

is not glamorous, but it is goodness.\n\n— Thomas Otter\n\nJenkins technical documentation is an important part of our project as it is key to using Jenkins well.\nGood documentation guides users and encourages good implementation choices.\nIt is a crucial part of the user experience.\n\nIn the recent Jenkins UI/UX hackfest, documentation was a specific track to improve the Jenkins user experience.\nWe received many improvements from experienced Jenkins contributors and newcomers alike.\nContributors from all around the world submitted pull requests for documentation on installing, managing, administering, and operating Jenkins.\n\nDocumentation migration from Wiki\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki pages have collected 15 years of experience and wisdom for Jenkins users.\nHowever, that experience and wisdom is intermixed with inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated information.\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki migration project identified the 50 most accessed pages on the Jenkins wiki and created GitHub issues to track the migration of those pages to www.jenkins.io.\nThis was our first large scale experiment using GitHub issues for documentation.\nThe results have been overwhelmingly positive.\nHackfest contributors added new sections to many documentation chapters, including:\n\nUsing Jenkins\n\nPipeline\n\nManaging Jenkins\n\nSystem Administration\n\nThe Hackfest closed 19 of the wiki migration issues.\nWork is in progress on an additional 25 wiki migration issues.\nWe’ve made great progress and look forward to even better results in the future.\nNew contributors used the \"good first issue\" label very effectively.\nWe started the Hackfest with most of the 25 \"good first issues\" unassigned and completed the Hackfest with 14 closed and 10 others in progress.\nWe’ll provide more \"good first issues\" as we use the Jenkins Wiki migration to welcome new documentation contributors.\n\nMigrating plugin documentation\n\nPlugin documentation is also in transition.\nSince November 2019, plugins have been moving their documentation into the GitHub repository that hosts the plugin source code.\nThis\"documentation as code\" approach allows plugin maintainers to include documentation improvements in the same pull requests that implement new capabilities.\nIt assures that documentation changes are reviewed by the same maintainers who review and approve new capabilities.\n\nHackfest participants submitted pull requests to migrate plugin documentation to GitHub.\n10 plugin pull requests are in progress from the Hackfest.\n5 plugin pull requests from the Hackfest have been already merged and are awaiting the release of the plugin.\n\nChuck Norris uses documentation as code\n\nIn the spirit of fun and adventure, Oleg Nenashev migrated the \"Chuck Norris plugin\" to GitHub documentation as code in a live Hackfest presentation May 26, 2020.\nLinks to the recording, the plugin migration guide, and the export tool are available from\"Migrating plugins to documentation-as-code\".\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nJenkins works with other technologies to solve automation challenges in many different environments.\nWe describe those environments in our\"Solution Pages\".\nAs part of the Hackfest, we’ve started a series of improvements to the solution pages.\n\nThe Docker solutions page now includes updated videos and a better page layout for easier reading and better navigation.\nOther solution pages will receive similar improvements in the future.\n\nSystem properties\n\nThe global configuration of Jenkins can be modified at startup by defining Java properties.\nSystem properties can change system defaults and can provide compatibility \"escape hatches\" when a new default configuration might be incompatible with existing installations.\n\nDaniel Beck has improved the navigation and user experience of the system properties page as part of the Hackfest.\nIt is now much easier to read and to reference, with embeddable links available with a mouse-over to the right of every property and labels that categorize and classify each property.\n\nPlugin site improvements\n\nDuring the Hackfest, Gavin Mogan has continued his efforts to improve the Jenkins Plugins Site so that users can easily access plugin changelogs and reported issues.\nOnce this pull request is merged, it will greatly improve the experience of those Jenkins users who want to update plugins and look for documentation about what has changed in them and what are the possible issues they might experience.\n\nExample of the incoming UI for the Jira plugin:\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThere is still much to do in Jenkins documentation and we need your help to do it.\nThere are many ways to participate in the Jenkins project, including documentation.\nSee the contributing guidelines for detailed instructions.\nJoin the documentation chat for personalized help and encouragement.\n\nThe Jenkins project has been also accepted to Google Season of Docs this year.\nThis open-source mentorship program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nWe are looking for technical writers who are interested to contribute to the project in September-December 2020.\nIt is a great opportunity to study Documentation-as-code tools and to learn more about contributing to open-source projects.\nYou can find Jenkins project ideas and more information here.","title":"Jenkins User Experience Hackfest Documentation
