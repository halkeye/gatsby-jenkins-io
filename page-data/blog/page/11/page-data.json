not glamorous, but it is goodness.\n\n— Thomas Otter\n\nJenkins technical documentation is an important part of our project as it is key to using Jenkins well.\nGood documentation guides users and encourages good implementation choices.\nIt is a crucial part of the user experience.\n\nIn the recent Jenkins UI/UX hackfest, documentation was a specific track to improve the Jenkins user experience.\nWe received many improvements from experienced Jenkins contributors and newcomers alike.\nContributors from all around the world submitted pull requests for documentation on installing, managing, administering, and operating Jenkins.\n\nDocumentation migration from Wiki\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki pages have collected 15 years of experience and wisdom for Jenkins users.\nHowever, that experience and wisdom is intermixed with inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated information.\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki migration project identified the 50 most accessed pages on the Jenkins wiki and created GitHub issues to track the migration of those pages to www.jenkins.io.\nThis was our first large scale experiment using GitHub issues for documentation.\nThe results have been overwhelmingly positive.\nHackfest contributors added new sections to many documentation chapters, including:\n\nUsing Jenkins\n\nPipeline\n\nManaging Jenkins\n\nSystem Administration\n\nThe Hackfest closed 19 of the wiki migration issues.\nWork is in progress on an additional 25 wiki migration issues.\nWe’ve made great progress and look forward to even better results in the future.\nNew contributors used the \"good first issue\" label very effectively.\nWe started the Hackfest with most of the 25 \"good first issues\" unassigned and completed the Hackfest with 14 closed and 10 others in progress.\nWe’ll provide more \"good first issues\" as we use the Jenkins Wiki migration to welcome new documentation contributors.\n\nMigrating plugin documentation\n\nPlugin documentation is also in transition.\nSince November 2019, plugins have been moving their documentation into the GitHub repository that hosts the plugin source code.\nThis\"documentation as code\" approach allows plugin maintainers to include documentation improvements in the same pull requests that implement new capabilities.\nIt assures that documentation changes are reviewed by the same maintainers who review and approve new capabilities.\n\nHackfest participants submitted pull requests to migrate plugin documentation to GitHub.\n10 plugin pull requests are in progress from the Hackfest.\n5 plugin pull requests from the Hackfest have been already merged and are awaiting the release of the plugin.\n\nChuck Norris uses documentation as code\n\nIn the spirit of fun and adventure, Oleg Nenashev migrated the \"Chuck Norris plugin\" to GitHub documentation as code in a live Hackfest presentation May 26, 2020.\nLinks to the recording, the plugin migration guide, and the export tool are available from\"Migrating plugins to documentation-as-code\".\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nJenkins works with other technologies to solve automation challenges in many different environments.\nWe describe those environments in our\"Solution Pages\".\nAs part of the Hackfest, we’ve started a series of improvements to the solution pages.\n\nThe Docker solutions page now includes updated videos and a better page layout for easier reading and better navigation.\nOther solution pages will receive similar improvements in the future.\n\nSystem properties\n\nThe global configuration of Jenkins can be modified at startup by defining Java properties.\nSystem properties can change system defaults and can provide compatibility \"escape hatches\" when a new default configuration might be incompatible with existing installations.\n\nDaniel Beck has improved the navigation and user experience of the system properties page as part of the Hackfest.\nIt is now much easier to read and to reference, with embeddable links available with a mouse-over to the right of every property and labels that categorize and classify each property.\n\nPlugin site improvements\n\nDuring the Hackfest, Gavin Mogan has continued his efforts to improve the Jenkins Plugins Site so that users can easily access plugin changelogs and reported issues.\nOnce this pull request is merged, it will greatly improve the experience of those Jenkins users who want to update plugins and look for documentation about what has changed in them and what are the possible issues they might experience.\n\nExample of the incoming UI for the Jira plugin:\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThere is still much to do in Jenkins documentation and we need your help to do it.\nThere are many ways to participate in the Jenkins project, including documentation.\nSee the contributing guidelines for detailed instructions.\nJoin the documentation chat for personalized help and encouragement.\n\nThe Jenkins project has been also accepted to Google Season of Docs this year.\nThis open-source mentorship program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nWe are looking for technical writers who are interested to contribute to the project in September-December 2020.\nIt is a great opportunity to study Documentation-as-code tools and to learn more about contributing to open-source projects.\nYou can find Jenkins project ideas and more information here.","title":"Jenkins User Experience Hackfest Documentation

everyone !\n\nThis is one of the Jenkins project in GSoC 2020. We are working this new Machine Learning Plugin for this GSoC 2020.\nThis is my story about the community bonding of GSoC 2020. I am happy to share my journey with you.\n\nIntroducing Myself and my Fantastic 4 Mentors\n\nI am Loghi Perinpanayagam from University of Moratuwa. I was selected for GSoC 2020 for Machine Learning Plugin in Jenkins. I am glad to introduce my mentors to this project. I was assigned with four mentors who are really enthusiastic to help me on kicking off this summer of code.\n\nStudent\n\nLoghi Perinpanayagam\n\nMentors\n\nBruno P. Kinoshita\n\nIoannis Moutsatsos\n\nMarky Jackson\n\nShivay Lamba\n\nHow was my preparation last year ?\n\nI learned about this open source program in my second year. But atleast I tried last year on a different organization’s project that was related to Data Visualization Recommendation for Data Science. But the problem was I did not contribute as much as this year and was too late in the application process. As usual Machine learning related projects have a lot of competition compared to other projects. I prepared on learning Data visualization in Machine Learning and existing Models for the recommendation system. Finally I wrote a proposal with the SeqToSeq model without much knowledge on neural networks at that time. And I did not communicate much through the dedicated slack channel.  That may be one of the reasons for the failure. But the main reason was my latency for GSoC 2019.\n\nHow did I hurdle GSoC 2020 ?\n\nSince the time I realized how open source is needed and helpful for the community, I have been passionate about contributing to open source projects. At the instance, I finished my internship in Bangalore, India in 2019, I immediately focused on participating in GSoC. This is my last year (2020) as a student of my BSc Computer Science life, I wanted to get selected this year as a student.\n\nThere was a guidance seminar organized by our department, I got to know that Jenkins had opened their project ideas. That was an extremely impressive beginning of my GSoC 2020 journey. I walked through all the draft and accepted projects in the Jenkins.io page. As I am already interested in Machine Learning and I am familiar with Java, I picked the most impressive idea for me that does not have an initial repo. That means I wanted to use my knowledge to think and research a lot with this project. But I had to contribute and want to know about the infrastructure of Jenkins codebase. Because that makes the selection panel easy to pick up the student for the project.  Then I repeatedly searched to contribute to Jenkins. I found issues that were easy for me to work from the git plugin and git client plugin. I started to contribute some test issues on git plugin and git client plugin. After I got a clear knowledge on how a plugin works in Jenkins, I started working on the POC with the hint provided in the project idea page. Actually, that was fun to code.\n\nMentors have helped many students during the application process. I was able to do a working POC that had a minimum capability to do the task of the project. Finally mentors opened for proposal submission. I hurried to prepare a draft proposal. After I got reviews from mentors, I started to improve the proposal. At the end of the proposal submission, I was able to deliver a good proposal for this project. As I was curious about this plugin, I dug into more on how to integrate Jupyter notebook with this plugin. I published an medium article as a result of my research during the acceptance waiting period.\n\nResults released\n\nThe result was going to be announced on 4th May, I believed in my project proposal and POC and I got selected for this GSoC 2020. Whoa ! That was a goosebumping moment in my entire life. The feeling was like Something I achieved. As a result of my hard work, I deserved that.\nFor example, I spent 7 days continuously making the POC work without any collision between maven artifacts.\n\nCommunity Bonding\n\nAfter the release of results, I was preparing myself for the community bonding. There are lots of interactions happening between me and mentors than before.I had to update my project page and my profile in Jenkins.io. We had our first meeting with lots of excitement and love on 10th of May. Mentors and I introduced ourselves even though we know each other. We discussed the high level view of GSoC and I asked some questions that I had in my mind. As my plugin was a new repository, most of the discussion was related to the repository and its name. I had  to find a name for the new plugin. We had regular conversations about the blogpost and presentations at the end.\n\nIn the second meeting, We discussed the process for hosting a new plugin in Jenkins, tracking issues with JIRA, blog posts and high level road map for the project. And I suggested some interesting plugin names but they were not matching to the goal of the project, mentors told me to try other names which perfectly describe the project. I was advised to read all the research guidelines and plugin naming conventions. We discussed how code reviews will be done and source code management through the git. After this meeting, our meeting has shifted to the official Jenkins Zoom account.\n\nOur third meeting was quite serious about our project planning. I had been preparing my design document for the project with the help of mentors before the meeting day. Hence I got lots of reviews and useful examples for my future work on phase 1. At this point, we decided with the plugin name Machine Learning Plugin which was accepted by all mentors and I created the repo and requested a Jira ticket for the plugin hosting request. We were planning to remind the Jira ticket within the next 3 days. Mentors want me to make sure I updated the Jenkins GSoC page before the community period ends. Lots of discussion carried about the design document that I had been preparing last week before the meeting. Some important points from the meeting notes follows :\n\nDefine features in the design document\n\nDiagrams for the operations\n\nHow plugin works in distributed environment\n\nCode editor library\n\nRequirements for the first Plugin release\n\nBlog post draft document\n\nToDo works for me for next week\n\nTherefore, I had to work hard after this meeting, this made me involved in the project more. I have to put my huge effort to make this opportunity golden. Our team has the willingness to complete this project and will definitely help the Data Science community with this plugin.\nKudos to my team for the amazing work so far!!!\n\nThis was my entire journey until now. Hope you enjoyed it and hope you learned the mistakes I made last year and corrected in this summer.\nThanks for reading, and Stay tuned I will be uploading blog posts for those of you interested.\n\nResources and Links\n\nProject page\n\nDesign document","title":"Machine Learning Plugin project - community bonding blog post","tags":["machinelearning","datascience","plugins","communitybonding","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/9b030/loghijiaha.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/f38b5/loghijiaha.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/bcd2b/loghijiaha.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/ceea6/loghijiaha.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/45b82/loghijiaha.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/933cd/loghijiaha.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/6c13d/loghijiaha.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":158}}},"blog":null,"github":"loghijiaha","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Computer Science and Engineering Student at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

Some plugins need support added and certain controls\ncould have some improvements done to render better.\n\nHow can I use it?\n\nThese permissions are currently available in beta and for now disabled by default.\nYou can enable them by installing the Extended read permission plugin v3.2 or above.\n\nThen you will need to add the following permissions to a user / group depending on your use case:\n\nOverall/SystemRead\n\nJob/ExtendedRead\n\nAgent/ExtendedRead\n\nNote: You will need to set the Overall/Read and Job/Read permissions as well.  You might\nwant to consider creating a role containing the required permissions.\n\nHere is an example using the Configuration as Code plugin and the Folder-based Authorization Strategy plugin :\n\njenkins:\n  authorizationStrategy:\n    folderBased:\n      globalRoles:\n        - name: \"admin\"\n          permissions:\n            - id: \"Overall/Administer\"\n          sids:\n            - \"admin\"\n        - name: \"global read\"\n          permissions:\n            - id: \"Agent/ExtendedRead\"\n            - id: \"Overall/SystemRead\"\n            - id: \"Overall/Read\"\n            - id: \"Job/Read\"\n            - id: \"Job/ExtendedRead\"\n          sids:\n            - \"reader\"\n\nI can’t see a configuration that I think should be allowed\n\nMost of Jenkins itself has been updated to support read-only Jenkins, but not very many plugins.\nPlease create an enhancement issue on the plugins issue tracker.\nIf the plugin uses Jira to track issues, then you can add it to the jira:JENKINS-12548[] epic.\n\nHow do I update my plugin to support it\n\nSee the Read only view section of the developer documentation.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nIn this release we introduce a foundation feature which is already supported in all key Jenkins core controls and in some plugins.\nThere are many plugins which contribute to global configurations and diagnostics which still need to be adapted to support the new mode.\nWe will keep working on this feature and its adoption so that the next LTS baseline in September provides a full-fledged user experience for Jenkins admins.\n\nSystem read permission is a featured project in the UI/UX Hackfest\nhappening May 25-29 2020.

would like to announce the availability of official Windows agent images for Docker.\nThese images allow provisioning Jenkins agents with Windows OS on Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nNew images\n\nAll official Docker images for agents now provide nanoserver-1809 and windowsservercore-1809 tags which include Windows images and, at the moment, Java 8 (these are like the latest tag).\nWe also provide tags with explicit Java selection, e.g. jdk8-windowsservercore-1809 or jdk11-nanoserver-1809.\nVersion tags are also available, e.g. jenkins/agent:4.3-4-jdk8-nanoserver-1809.\n\njenkins/agent is a basic agent which bundles the agent.jar for agent ⇐ ⇒ controller communication. This is most useful as a base image for other images.\nWindows images are available starting from version 4.3-4\n\njenkins/inbound-agent is an agent that is based on the jenkins/agent image above. It provides a wrapper script written in PowerShell to help specify the parameters to agent.jar.\nWindows images are available starting from version 4.3-4\n\njenkins/ssh-agent is an image which has OpenSSH installed and should be used with the SSH Build Agents Plugin.\nWindows images are available starting from version 2.1.0\n\nUsing Windows Docker images\n\nTo use the new images, you will need a proper Docker or Kubernetes environment which supports running Windows containers.\nFor Windows desktop users, the easiest way is to use Docker for Windows.\nWindows support in Kubernetes is documented here.\n\njenkins/agent\n\nThe jenkins/agent image is a simple agent with the JDK and the agent.jar (Jenkins Remoting library).\n\nThere are two main use cases for this image:\n\nAs a base image for other Docker images (e.g., FROM jenkins/agent:jdk8-nanoserver-1809 in your Dockerfile). The jenkins/inbound-agent is based on this image.\n\nThis image may also be used to launch an agent using the Launch method of Launch agent via execution of command on the master.  This allows the controller to launch the agent inside the docker container automatically.\n\nTo run the agent for the second use case, you would specify the following command on the Jenkins controller after setting Remote root directory to C:\\Users\\jenkins\\agent :\n\ndocker run -i --rm --name agent --init jenkins/agent:jdk8-windowsservercore-1809 java -jar C:/ProgramData/Jenkins/agent.jar\n\njenkins/inbound-agent\n\nThe inbound-agent Docker image tries to provide a higher level interaction with the agent.jar executable. It provides a PowerShell wrapper script around agent.jar and it is specified as the entrypoint so that you just need to pass in some command line arguments to run the agent. A pull request has been opened which documents these command line parameters and environment variables.\n\nExample:\n\ndocker run jenkins/inbound-agent:windowsservercore-1809 `\n   -Url http://jenkins-server:port `\n   -WorkDir=C:/Users/jenkins/Agent `\n   -Secret `\n   -Name\n\nExample using environment variables:\n\ndocker run -e \"JENKINS_URL=http://jenkins-server:port\" -e \"JENKINS_AGENT_NAME=AGENTNAME\" `\n   jenkins/inbound-agent:windowsservercore-1809 `\n   -WorkDir=C:/Users/jenkins/Agent `\n   -Secret `\n   -Name\n\nThe -Url, -Name and -Secret parameters are required, but can be specified as either command line parameters or environment variables.\n\njenkins/ssh-agent\n\nAs mentioned above the jenkins/ssh-agent docker image is based on SSH communication with the controller, rather than the remoting TCP or WebSocket protocols. The image sets up a jenkins user and the OpenSSH server so that the controller can connect to the agent via SSH. The image expects an SSH public key as a parameter and puts that key into the authorized_keys file for the jenkins user. The private key should be specified in the agent configuration on the controller to allow the controller to connect.\n\nExample:\n\ndocker run jenkins/ssh-agent:jdk8-windowsservercore-1809 \"\"\n\nYou can also pass the public key as an environment variable when using docker run.\n\nExample:\n\ndocker run -e \"JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=\" jenkins/ssh-agent:jdk8-windowsservercore-1809\n\nYou will then be able to connect this agent using the SSH Build Agents Plugin as \"jenkins\" with the matching private key.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe are considering providing versions based on Windows Server 2019 build 1909 so that Jenkins users can run these images on GKE clusters (see this issue).\n\nWe are also looking into providing multiarch manifests which would allow Windows images to be part of the latest tag.\n\nThere is also an open pull-request to create a Windows based Docker image for a Jenkins controller. There hasn’t been a lot of requests for this, but to make the offerings complete for Windows users, the pull request was created.\n\nFor plans unrelated to Windows, please see the Docker images for agents: New names and What’s next blogpost.","title":"Windows Docker Agent Images: General Availability","tags":["announcement","docker","platform-sig","windows"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#988878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/19e71/slide_o_mix.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/77b35/slide_o_mix.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/d4a57/slide_o_mix.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/19e71/slide_o_mix.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/ef6ff/slide_o_mix.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/8257c/slide_o_mix.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/6766a/slide_o_mix.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"slide","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Alex comes from a .NET background but likes to get his hands dirty in many different languages and frameworks.

would like to announce the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.\nIt does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.\nThis article provides information about the new official names, upgrade procedure, and the support policy for the old images.\nWe will also talk about what’s next for the Docker packaging in Jenkins.\n\nNew image names\n\njenkins/agent is the new name of the old jenkins/slave image,\nstarting from 4.3-2\n\njenkins/inbound-agent is the new name of the jenkins/jnlp-slave image,\nstarting from 4.3-2\n\njenkins/ssh-agent is the new name of the old jenkins/ssh-slave image,\nstarting from 2.0.0\n\nSee the upgrade guidelines below.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe \"slave\" term is widely considered inappropriate in open source communities.\nIt has been officially deprecated in Jenkins 2.0 in 2016, but there are remaining usages in some Jenkins components.\nThe jira:JENKINS-42816[Slave to Agent renaming leftovers] EPIC tracks cleanup of such usages.\nOfficial Docker agent images were a glaring case, it was not easy to fix that with the previous versions of the image release Pipelines on DockerHub.\nIt is great to have the image naming issue finally fixed by this update.\n\nAnother notable change is replacing the JNLP agent term with inbound agent.\nHistorically \"JNLP\" has been used as a name of Remoting protocols.\nJNLP stands for Java Network Launch Protocol which is a part of the Java Web Start.\nJenkins supports Java Web Start mode for agents when running agents on Java 1.8,\nbut our networking protocols are based on TCP and have nothing to do with Java Network Launch Protocol.\nThis name has been very confusing since the beginning\nand became worse with the introduction of WebSocket support in Jenkins 2.217 (jep:222[]).\nDocker agent images support WebSockets, so we decided to change the image name to jenkins/inbound-agent so that it prevents further confusion.\nInbound agent term refers to agent protocols in which the agent initiates the connection to the Jenkins controller through different protocols.\n\nThanks a lot to Alex Earl and krufab for the repository restructuring groundwork which made the renaming possible!\nAlso thanks to Tim Jacomb, Marky Jackson, Mark Waite, Ivan Fernandez Calvo and other contributors for their reviews and testing.\n\nUpgrading and Compatibility Notes\n\nGood news, there are no breaking changes caused by this renaming.\nAll images have been already modified to use the new terminology internally.\nIf you use the recent versions of the previous images,\nyou can just replace the old names with the new ones.\nThese names may be referenced in your Dockerfiles, scripts, and Jenkins configurations.\n\nWe will keep updating the old images on DockerHub for at least 3 months (until August 05, 2020).\nThere will be no new configurations and platforms added to the old images,\nbut all existing ones will remain available (Debian for Java 1.8 and 11, Alpine for Java 1.8, etc.).\nAfter August 05, 2020, the old images will no longer receive updates, but previous versions will remain available to users on DockerHub.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe will continue renaming of the Docker images in Jenkins components which reference old image names.\nThere is also a set of convenience Docker images which include build tools like Maven or Gradle which will be renamed later.\nThe jenkins/ssh-agent image might be renamed again in the future as well;\nsee the ongoing discussion in this developer mailing list thread.\n\nIf you are rather interested in new features in Jenkins Docker packaging,\nstay tuned for future announcements!\nThere are multiple ongoing initiatives which you can find on the public Jenkins roadmap\n(in the draft stage, see jep:14[]).\nSome stories:\n\nGeneral availability of Windows images.\n\nSupport for more platforms (AArch64, IBM s390x, PowerPC).\n\nSwitching to AdoptOpenJDK.\n\nIntroducing multi-platform Docker images.\n\nIf you are interested in any of these projects and would like to contribute,\nplease reach out to the Platform Special Interest Group which coordinates initiatives related to Jenkins in Docker.\n\nRegarding the agent terminology cleanup outside Docker images,\nwe will keep working on this project in the Advocacy & Outreach SIG.\nIf you see the usage of the obsolete \"slave\" term anywhere in the Jenkins organization (Web UI, documentation, etc.),\nplease feel free to submit a pull request or to report an issue in the jira:JENKINS-42816[Slave to Agent renaming leftovers] EPIC.\nThere are \"just\" 3000 occurences left in the jenkinsci GitHub organization, but we will get there.\nAny contributions will be appreciated!","title":"Docker images for agents: New names and What's

of the things we loved about going to developer conferences was meeting Jenkins users — newbies and old-timers alike — who are excited to talk about their projects and share tips on how to move forward using Jenkins.\nSince the coronavirus pandemic, we’re learning to rely more on new ways to gather, and it’s happening via Jenkins online meetups, GitHub collaborations, and Twitter threads, to name a few.\n\nIt’s a significant change.\nBut what hasn’t changed is the need to share stories about the things users have built, the solutions they’ve developed, and the excellent results they’re getting from some really innovative Jenkins implementations.\nThen we wondered, why isn’t anyone collecting these user stories and sharing them with the Jenkins community.\n\nIntroducing Jenkins is the Way\n\nSo we took the first step to record and archive all the great stuff everyone in our community is building with Jenkins.\nThis way, Jenkins users old and new can come to an archive and search for Jenkins solutions for inspiration.\nWe foresee a vast library of solutions from all around the world, solving a wide array of challenges in every industry imaginable.\nWe decided to call this archive \" Jenkins Is The Way\" and host it at https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io.\n\nTo aggregate all these stories, we built a simple online questionnaire so that Jenkins users can submit their own experience using this leading open source automation server.\nWith so many plugins to support building, deploying, and automating your projects, we expect to see a vast collection of stories.\n\nWe’ve already received a handful, including stories that illustrate how Jenkins Is The Way :\n\nto code your own release pipelines\n\nto cast magic of continuous delivery\n\nto understand and simplify your

No more need for 'bot' users or figuring out who should be the owner of 2FA or OAuth tokens.\n\nImproved security and tighter permissions - GitHub Apps offer much finer-grained permissions compared to a service user and its personal access tokens. This lets the Jenkins GitHub app require a much smaller set of privileges to run properly.\n\nAccess to GitHub Checks API - GitHub Apps can access the the GitHub Checks API to create check runs and check suites from Jenkins jobs and provide detailed feedback on commits as well as code annotation\n\nGetting started\n\nInstall the GitHub Branch Source plugin,\nmake sure the version is 2.7.1 or above.\n\nConfiguring the GitHub Organization Folder\n\nFollow the GitHub App Authentication setup guide.  These instructions are also linked from the plugin’s README on GitHub.\n\nOnce you’ve finished setting it up, Jenkins will validate your credential and you should see your new rate limit.\nHere’s an example on a large org:\n\nHow do I get an API token in my pipeline?\n\nIn addition to usage of GitHub App authentication for Multi-Branch Pipeline, you can also use app authentication directly in your Pipelines.\nYou can access the Bearer token for the GitHub API by just loading a 'Username/Password' credential as usual,\nthe plugin will handle authenticating with GitHub in the background.\n\nThis could be used to call additional GitHub API endpoints from your pipeline, possibly the\ndeployments api or you may wish to implement your own\nchecks api integration until Jenkins supports this out of the box.\n\nNote: the API token you get will only be valid for one hour, don’t get it at the start of the pipeline and assume it will be valid all the way through\n\nExample: Let’s submit a check run to Jenkins from our Pipeline:\n\npipeline {\n  agent any\n\n  stages{\n    stage('Check run') {\n      steps {\n        withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'githubapp-jenkins',\n                                          usernameVariable: 'GITHUB_APP',\n                                          passwordVariable: 'GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN')]) {\n            sh '''\n            curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n                 -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github.antiope-preview+json\" \\\n                 -H \"authorization: Bearer ${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}\" \\\n                 -d '{ \"name\": \"check_run\", \\\n                       \"head_sha\": \"'${GIT_COMMIT}'\", \\\n                       \"status\": \"in_progress\", \\\n                       \"external_id\": \"42\", \\\n                       \"started_at\": \"2020-03-05T11:14:52Z\", \\\n                       \"output\": { \"title\": \"Check run from Jenkins!\", \\\n                                   \"summary\": \"This is a check run which has been generated from Jenkins as GitHub App\", \\\n                                   \"text\": \"...and that is awesome\"}}' https://api.github.com/repos/ / /check-runs\n            '''\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhat’s next\n\nGitHub Apps authentication in Jenkins is a huge improvement.  Many teams have already started using it and have helped improve it by giving pre-release feedback. There are more improvements on the way.\n\nThere’s a proposed Google Summer of Code project: GitHub Checks API for Jenkins Plugins.\nIt will look at integrating with the Checks API,\nwith a focus on reporting issues found using the warnings-ng plugin\ndirectly onto the GitHub pull requests, along with test results summary on GitHub.\nHopefully it will make the Pipeline example below much simpler for Jenkins users :)\nIf you want to get involved with this, join the GSoC Gitter channel\nand ask how you can help.","title":"GitHub App authentication support released","tags":["github","github-branch-source","pipeline","announcement"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"timja","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer, along with slack, azure-keyvault and configuration-as-code plugins.\nTim started using Jenkins in 2013 and became an active contributor in 2018.\nTim enjoys working on open source software in his “free” time.</p>\n</div>","id":"timja","irc":null,"linkedin":"tim-jacomb-98043174","name":"Tim Jacomb","slug":"/blog/authors/timja","twitter":"Tjaynz"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":80,"numPages":100,"currentPage":11}},
