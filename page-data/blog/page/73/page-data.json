For example, it automatically archives your build artifacts, fingerprints all the relevant information, and so on. These are good things, and naturally, it cost time. +\n +\n\n+\nBut the slow down they are seeing was substantial, and this is a complaint I've heard from others as well. So I started looking into it. +\n +\n\n+\nWith a help of https://linux.die.net/man/8/tc[artificial delay] induced to my network interface and several custom scripts to probe into the running processes, I was able to understand what was going on and make some good improvements. +\n +\n\n+\nFirst, in Maven plugin 2.0, we've made a change in the way we archive artifacts from Maven. Previously, the artifacts were copied between the controller and the Maven JVM, and for a reason I'll mention later, this was very slow, especially in a network that has a large latency. With Maven plugin 2.0 and onward, artifacts are archived between the controller and the agent JVM. +\n +\n\n+\nThe second problem that I discovered was that the spy program we put inside Maven is causing excessive amount of unnecessary classloading. Some classes have static initializers that too eagerly refer to other classes, which in turn brings in other classes, and so on. Despite https://jenkins-ci.org/content/faster-slave-classloading[the jar file caching that we do], these classloading still sometimes requires precious roundtrips to the controller, which costs in the order of 10s of ms. I was able to make various changes in Jenkins core to cut this down, and these fixes will land in Jenkins 1.559 (ETA is April 14th.) The classloading overhead is independent of the size of your Maven build, so this improvement is more for people who have lots of small Maven builds, like https://ci.jenkins.io/[Jenkins building Jenkins plugins]. +\n +\n\n+\nNow, on to the biggest fruit of this investigation I was able to discover and fix. Imagine the Maven JVM has a lot of data to send to the controller, say you are archiving test reports or code coverage report. A good implementation would send these data as fast as possible to the controller, paying respect to the limit of flow control to avoid overwhelming the controller. +\n +\n\n+\nIt turns out that the way we set up this communication channel was far from optimal. Instead of having the Maven JVM push data with flow control, we were relying on the controller to pull data. That is, controller has to send out a request to the agent to fetch the next batch of data (8KB), then once it receives that data, it sends out another request to fetch the next batch of data, and so on. If your network latency is 10ms, this scheme only lets us send 500KB/sec, even if you have a gigabit ethernet. No wonder it was so slow! +\n +\n\n+\nThis fix is in in Maven plugin 2.2. See https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-22354[JENKINS-22354] if you want to know more about the actual diffs and such. +\n +\nUnfortunately, none of these are available for those who are on 1.532.x LTS, but http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2014/jenkins.2014-04-02-18.02.html[the next 1.554.1 LTS] will be able to run the newer Maven 2.2 plugin. So the help is on the way! +\n +","title":"Maven job type performance improvements in Maven plugin 2.2","tags":["development","plugins","releases"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"5310f9d3-4ee4-5c01-b1d2-55f71e342385","slug":"/blog/2014/04/01/your-java-web-start-slaves-will-be-always-clean/","strippedHtml":"+ +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIf you have agents that connect through https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-LaunchslaveagentviaJavaWebStart[Java Web Start] (such as https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+as+a+Windows+service#InstallingJenkinsasaWindowsservice-InstallSlaveasaWindowsservice%28require.NET2.0framework%29[agents installed as Windows services]), we have a good news for you. +\n +\n\n+\nIn case of a connection loss, this type of agents has been designed to automatically attempt to reconnect to the controller. This makes sense because you want these agents to remain online all the time, even if your janitor trips over the ethernet cable. Unfortunately, it also means that over the time, these agents accumulate gunk, such as mutated static states, any left-over threads or memory leaks, or https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-20913[native libraries that are loaded into JVM]. +\n +\n\n+\nTo prevent that, a better approach is to https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-19055[restart the agent JVM (JENKINS-19055)] and have the new JVM reconnect, instead of having the same JVM reconnect. That would ensure that the agent always stays clean. I've planned to make this change for a while now, and I'm happy to report that this change is finally landing to the upcoming 1.559. +\n +\n\n+\nRestarting JVM is easy on Unix, where I could just https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html[exec(3)] to itself. We've been doing this for ages on controllers, for example when you update a plugin and tell Jenkins to restart. +\n +\n\n+\nThe hard part is to do this for Windows, where the most of the time was spent. I had to improve https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw[windows service wrapper] to support self-restarting services, which turned out to be trickier because Windows service control manager doesn't provide \"restart\" as an atomic operation. It also kills not just the service process itself but all the processes in the group. So I had to double-fork the service wrapper into a separate process group just to restart a service from within itself. +\n +\n\n+\nIn any case, the end result is that if https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+as+a+Windows+service#InstallingJenkinsasaWindowsservice-InstallSlaveasaWindowsservice%28require.NET2.0framework%29[you have installed a service through GUI], be it on Windows, Unix, or OS X, agents will restart themselves every time it gets disconnected from the controller. +\n +\n\n+\nI've also taken the opportunity to make `+jenkins-slave.exe+` on the agent self-updating. Every time it connects to the controller, it gets the latest version from the controller. +\n +\n\n+\nIf you have installed Web Start agents as services, make sure to update the local copy of `+agent.jar+` on these agents to 2.37 or later. This \"restart on reconnect\" feature only kicks in when you are running this very recent version of `+agent.jar+`. And yes, we realize it'd be nice for `+agent.jar+` to update itself, which is tracked as https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-22454[JENKINS-22454].

I did my part in https://bobbickel.blogspot.com/2013/10/kk-jenkins-and-triumph-of-technology.html[signing bobble heads] and answering questions, and I was able to finally put faces to some of the people who I actively interact in the community but never met before. +\n +\n\n+\nI tried to https://www.flickr.com/photos/12508267@N00/sets/72157637144035034/[take as many pictures as I can], and https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.700790069940324.1073741828.150316981654305&type=3[Lisa and Alyssa had posted their pictures as well].

So I thought the least I can do is to give them a spotlight and talk about who they are and what they do: +\n +\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nPlatinum Sponsor\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n**https://www.blogger.com/null[]**https://www.cloudbees.com/[*image:https://www.cloudbees.com/sites/default/files/CloudBees-web.png[image]*] +\n +\n\n+\n\n+\n\nCloudBees is the lead organizer for JUC and offers Jenkins in whatever\nform you wish to use it - on-premises or in the cloud.
