This week was 10 steps forward, and about 1.5 backwards…​\n\nThere were two releases this week, b19 and b20. Unfortunately, b20 had to\nbe released shortly after b19 hit the Update Center as an incompatible API\nchange in a 3rd party plugin was discovered.\n\nRegardless, the latest b20 has a lot of important improvements, and some\nvery nice new features.\n\nA first cut of the \"Create Pipeline\" UX, seen above, allowing you to create Git\nbased Multibranch Pipelines like you have never seen before.\n\nHandling network disconnections from the browser to server (eg server\nrestart, network etc) gracefully with a nice UI.\n\nMore precise time information for steps and running Pipelines.\n\nMore information when a Pipeline is blocked on infrastructure, such as when\nthe Pipeline is waiting for an agent to become available.\n\nFixed a really embarrassing typo (a prize if you spot it).\n\nTest reports now include stdout and stderr\n\nBetter support for parallel visualisation, such as when a parallel step exists outside of a stage.\n\nThe Visual Editor also had another release, with the \"sheets\" visual component\nand better validation.\n\nCreation\n\nCurrently this is hidden behind a\nfeature toggle,\nto access append?blueCreate to the URL in you browser, and then press the\n\"New Pipeline\" button. Currently it lets you quickly create a Pipeline from\nGit, add credentials, etc, in a very nice UX. More SCM types are being added to\nsupport this.\n\nReconnect/disconnect\n\nAs Blue Ocean is a very \"live\" style of UX, if your network becomes\nunavailable, or the server is restarted, it is good to know in case you\nwere staring at the screen waiting for something to happen (don’t you have\nanything better to do??). When this happens, now you get a polite message,\nand then when the connection is restored, even if you are waiting for a\nPipeline run to finish, it will then notice this, and refresh things for\nyou:\n\nNote the opacity changes to make it clear even if you don’t see the little\nmessage. Very nice addition for those of us who work on a train far to often.\n\nUp next\n\nWhat is up next:\n\nSCM Api changes should land, making things much better for users of\nGitHub, Bitbucket, and many more.\n\nCreating Pipelines from GitHub (including automatic discovery).\n\nLots of fixes and enhancements in the Pipeline from all over the place\n\nMore ATH [ 1 ] coverage against regressions\n\nMore Visual Editor releases as Declarative Pipeline reaches version 1.0\n\nImprovements to i18n\n\nThere was also a couple of \"alternative beta\" releases in the \"Experimental\nUpdate Center\" to help test the new SCM API improvements for better use of\nGitHub APIs (based on\nthis branch)\nI do not recommend trying this branch unless you know what you are doing,\nas this will migrate some data, but help testing it would be appreciated!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nIf you’re interested in helping to make Blue Ocean a great user experience for\nJenkins, please join the Blue Ocean development team on\nGitter!\n\n1.

It does this by:\n\nAdding two types of Conditional BuildStep (\"Single\" and \"Multiple\") -\nthese build steps contain one or more other build steps to be run when the configured\ncondition is met\n\nAdding a set of Condition operations -\nthese control whether the Conditional BuildStep execute the contained step(s)\n\nLeveraging the Token Macro facility -\nthese provide values to the Conditions for evaluation\n\nIn the example below, this project will run the shell script step when the value of the\nREQUESTED_ACTION token equals \"greeting\".\n\nHere’s the output when I run this project with REQUESTED_ACTION set to \"greeting\":\n\nRun condition [Strings match] enabling prebuild for step [Execute shell]\nStrings match run condition: string 1=[greeting], string 2=[greeting]\nRun condition [Strings match] enabling perform for step [Execute shell]\n[freestyle-conditional] $ /bin/sh -xe /var/folders/hp/f7yc_mwj2tq1hmbv_5n10v2c0000gn/T/hudson5963233933358491209.sh\n+ echo 'Hello, bitwiseman!'\nHello, bitwiseman!\nFinished: SUCCESS\n\nAnd when I pass the value \"silence\":\n\nRun condition [Strings match] enabling prebuild for step [Execute shell]\nStrings match run condition: string 1=[silence], string 2=[greeting]\nRun condition [Strings match] preventing perform for step [Execute shell]\nFinished: SUCCESS\n\nThis is a simple example but the conditional step can contain any regular build step.\nWhen combined with other plugins, it can control whether to send notifications,\ngather data from other sources, wait for user feedback, or call other projects.\n\nThe Conditional BuildStep plugin does a great job of leveraging strengths of\nthe Jenkins web UI, Freestyle jobs, and UI-based programming,\nbut it is also hampered by their limitations.\nThe Jenkins web UI can be clunky and confusing at times.\nLike the steps in any Freestyle job, these conditional steps are only\nstored and viewable in Jenkins.\nThey are not versioned with other product or build code and can’t be code reviewed.\nLike any number of UI-based programming tools, it has to make trade-offs between clarity\nand flexibility: more options or clearer presentation.\nThere’s only so much space on the screen.\n\nConverting to Pipeline\n\nJenkins Pipeline, on the other hand, enables users to implement their pipeline as code.\nPipeline code can be written directly in the Jenkins Web UI or in any text editor.\nIt is a full-featured programming language,\nwhich gives users access to much broader set of conditional statements\nwithout the restrictions of UI-based programming.\n\nSo, taking the example above, the Pipeline equivalent is:\n\n// Declarative //\npipeline {\n    agent any\n    parameters {\n        choice(\n            choices: ['greeting' , 'silence'],\n            description: '',\n            name: 'REQUESTED_ACTION')\n    }\n\n    stages {\n        stage ('Speak') {\n            when {\n                // Only say hello if a \"greeting\" is requested\n                expression { params.REQUESTED_ACTION == 'greeting' }\n            }\n            steps {\n                echo \"Hello, bitwiseman!\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n// Script //\nproperties ([\n    parameters ([\n        choice (\n            choices: ['greeting', 'silence'],\n            description: '',\n            name : 'REQUESTED_ACTION')\n    ])\n])\n\nnode {\n    stage ('Speak') {\n        // Only say hello if a \"greeting\" is requested\n        if (params.REQUESTED_ACTION == 'greeting') {\n            echo \"Hello, bitwiseman!\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen I run this project with REQUESTED_ACTION set to \"greeting\", here’s the output:\n\n[Pipeline] node\nRunning on osx_mbp in /Users/bitwiseman/jenkins/agents/osx_mbp/workspace/pipeline-conditional\n[Pipeline] {\n[Pipeline] stage\n[Pipeline] { (Speak)\n[Pipeline] echo\nHello, bitwiseman!\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // stage\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // node\n[Pipeline] End of Pipeline\nFinished: SUCCESS\n\nWhen I pass the value \"silence\", the only change is \"Hello, bitwiseman!\" is not printed.\n\nSome might argue that the Pipeline code is a bit harder to understand on first reading.\nOthers would say the UI is just as confusing if not more so.\nEither way, the Pipeline representation is considerably more compact than the Jenkins UI presentation.\nPipeline also lets us add helpful comments, which we can’t do in the Freestyle UI.\nAnd we can easily put this Pipeline in a Jenkinsfile to be code-reviewed, checked-in, and versioned\nalong with the rest of our code.\n\nConditions\n\nThe previous example showed the \"Strings match\" condition and its Pipeline equivalent.\nLet’s look at couple more interesting conditions and their Jenkins Pipeline equivalents.\n\nBoolean condition\n\nYou might think that a boolean condition would be the simplest condition, but it isn’t.\nSince it works with string values from tokens, the Conditional BuildStep plugin offers\na number of ways to indicate true or false.\nTruth is a case insensitive match of one of the following:\n1 (the number one), Y, YES, T, TRUE, ON or RUN.\n\nPipeline can duplicate these, but depending on the scenario we might consider\nwhether a simpler expression would suffice.\n\nPipeline\n\n// Declarative //\nwhen {\n    // case insensitive regular expression for truthy values\n    expression { return token ==~ /(?i)(Y|YES|T|TRUE|ON|RUN)/ }\n}\nsteps {\n    /* step */\n}\n\n// Script //\n// case insensitive regular expression for truthy values\nif (token ==~ /(?i)(Y|YES|T|TRUE|ON|RUN)/) {\n    /* step */\n}\n\nLogical \"OR\" of conditions\n\nThis condition wraps other conditions.\nIt takes their results as inputs and performs a logical \"or\" of the results.\nThe AND and NOT conditions do the same, performing their respective operations.\n\nPipeline\n\n// Declarative //\nwhen {\n    // A or B\n    expression { return A || B }\n}\nsteps {\n    /* step */\n}\n\n// Script //\n// A or B\nif (A || B) {\n    /* step */\n}\n\nTokens\n\nTokens can be considerably more work than conditions.\nThere are more of them and they cover a much broader range of behaviors.\nThe previous example showed one of the simpler cases, accessing a build parameter,\nwhere the token has a direct equivalent in Pipeline.\nHowever, many tokens don’t have direct equivalents,\nsome take a parameters (adding to their complexity),\nand some provide information that is simply not exposed in Pipeline yet.\nSo, determining how to migrate tokens needs to be done on case-by-case basis.\n\nLet’s look at a few examples.\n\n\"FILE\" token\n\nExpands to the contents of a file. The file path is relative to the build workspace root.\n\n${FILE,path=\"PATH\"}\n\nThis token maps directly to the readFile step.\nThe only difference is the file path for readFile is relative to the\ncurrent working directory on the agent, but that is the workspace root by default.\nNo problem.\n\nPipeline\n\n// Declarative //\nwhen {\n    expression { return readFile('pom.xml').contains('mycomponent') }\n}\nsteps {\n    /* step */\n}\n\n// Script //\nif (readFile('pom.xml').contains('mycomponent')) {\n    /* step */\n}\n\nGIT_BRANCH\n\nExpands to the name of the branch that was built.\n\nParameters (descriptions omitted): all, fullName.\n\nThis information may or may not be exposed in Pipeline.  If you’re using the\nPipeline Multibranch plugin\nenv.BRANCH_NAME will give similar basic information, but doesn’t offer the parameters.\nThere are also\nseveral\nissues\nfiled around GIT_* tokens in Pipeline.\nUntil they are addressed fully, we can follow the pattern shown in\npipeline-examples,\nexecuting a shell to get the information we need.\n\nPipeline\n\nGIT_BRANCH = sh(returnStdout: true, script: 'git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD').trim()\n\nCHANGES_SINCE_LAST_SUCCESS\n\nDisplays the changes since the last successful build.\n\nParameters (descriptions omitted):\nreverse, format, changesFormat, showPaths, pathFormat,\nshowDependencies, dateFormat, regex, replace, default.\n\nNot only is the information provided by this token not exposed in Pipeline,\nthe token has ten optional parameters, including format strings and regular expression\nsearches. There are a number of ways we might get similar information in Pipeline.\nEach have their own particular limitations and ways they differ from the token output.\nThen we’ll need to consider how each of the parameters changes the output.\nIf nothing else, translating this token is clearly beyond the scope of this post.\n\nSlightly More Complex Example\n\nLet’s do one more example that shows some of these conditions and tokens.\nThis time we’ll perform different build steps depending on what branch we’re building.\nWe’ll take two build parameters: BRANCH_PATTERN and FORCE_FULL_BUILD.\nBased on BRANCH_PATTERN, we’ll checkout a repository.\nIf we’re building on the master branch or the user checked FORCE_FULL_BUILD,\nwe’ll call three other builds in parallel\n( full-build-linux, full-build-mac, and full-build-windows),\nwait for them to finish, and report the result.\nIf we’re not building on the master branch and the user did not check FORCE_FULL_BUILD,\nwe’ll print a message saying we skipped the full builds.\n\nFreestyle\n\nHere’s the configuration for Freestyle version.\n(It’s pretty long.  Feel free to skip down to the Pipeline version):\n\nThe Pipeline version of this job determines the GIT_BRANCH branch by\nrunning a shell script that returns the current local branch name.\nThis means that the Pipeline version must checkout to a local branch (not a detached head).\n\nFreestyle version of this job does not require a local branch, GIT_BRANCH is set automatically.\nHowever, to maintain functional parity, the Freestyle version of this job includes\n\"Checkout to Specific Local Branch\" as well.\n\nPipeline\n\nHere’s the equivalent Pipeline:\n\nFreestyle version of this job is not stored in source control.\n\nIn general, the Pipeline version of this job would be stored in source control,\nwould checkout scm, and would run that same repository.\nHowever, to maintain functional parity, the Pipeline version shown does a checkout\nfrom source control but is not stored in that repository.\n\nPipeline\n\n// Script //\nproperties ([\n    parameters ([\n        string

said before, the Conditional BuildStep plugin is great.\nIt provides a clear, easy to understand way to add conditional logic to any Freestyle job.\nBefore Pipeline, it was one of the few plugins to do this and it remains one of the most popular plugins.\nNow that we have Pipeline, we can implement conditional logic directly in code.\n\nThis is blog post discussed how to approach converting conditional build steps to Pipeline\nand showed a couple concrete examples.  Overall, I’m pleased with the results so far.\nI found scenarios which could not easily be migrated to Pipeline, but even those\nare only more difficult, rather than impossible.\n\nThe next thing to do is add a section to the\nJenkins Handbook documenting the Pipeline\nequivalent of all of the Conditions and the most commonly used Tokens.\nLook for it soon!\n\nLinks\n\nConditional BuildStep

8 back in last November, and now reaching 58% two months later.\n\nIf we only look at Jenkins 2.x, then we reach 72%.\n\nJava 8 runtime is known from the field to be more stable\n\nMany developers have been wanting to be allowed to leverage the improvements that Java 8 provides to the language and platform\n(lambdas, Date/Time API…​ just to name a few).\nBeing also a developer community, we want Jenkins to be appealing to contributors.\n\nIf you have questions or feedback about this announcement, please feel free to post it to the Jenkins developers mailing list.","title":"Jenkins

regressions\ndiscovered after release have now been resolved and this post has been updated with the correct plugin version numbers.\n\nSee this post for more details.\n\nWe are announcing the\nSCM API\n2.0.x and\nBranch API\n2.0.x release lines.\n\nDownstream of this there are also some great improvements to a number of popular plugins including:\n\nGitHub Branch Source\n\nBitBucket branch source\n\nGit\n\nMercurial\n\nPipeline Multibranch\n\nGitHub Organization Folders\n\nThere are some gotcha’s that Jenkins administrators will need to be aware of.\n\nAlways take a backup of your JENKINS_HOME before upgrading any plugins.\n\nWe want to give you the whole story, but the take home message is this:\n\nWhen updating the\nSCM API\nand/or\nBranch API\nplugins to the 2.0.x release lines, if you have any of the\nGitHub Organization Folders,\nGitHub Branch Source\nand/or\nBitBucket branch source\nplugins installed then you must upgrade them all to 2.0.x at the same time or Bad Things™ will happen.\n\n— A Jenkins Administrator\n\nDo NOT upgrade some of these plugins but not others!\nDoing so may cause your jobs to fail to load.\n\nIf you don’t care about the hows and whys, you can just skip down to this section but if you are curious…​ here we go!\n\nThe back-story\n\nWay back in September 2013 we announced the\nLiterate plugin,\nas an experimental new way of modeling branch development in Jenkins.\n\nWhen you are performing an experiment, the recommendation is to do just enough work to let you perform the test.\nHowever, the culture in Jenkins is to always try and produce reusable components that others can use in ways you have not anticipated.\n\nSo when releasing the initial version of the\nLiterate plugin\nwe also separated the Literate specific bits from the SCM specific concepts and multi-branch concepts.\nThese were lower level concepts were organized into the following plugins:\n\nSCM API -\nwhich was intended to be a plugin to hold a next generation API for interacting with source control systems.\n\nBranch API -\nwhich was intended to be a plugin to hold the multi-branch functionality that was abstracted from the usage by the Literate plugin.\n\nIn addition, we released updates to three of the more common SCM plugins which included implementations of the SCM API:\n\nGit plugin\n\nSubversion plugin\n\nMercurial plugin\n\nWhile there was some interest in the Literate plugin, it did not gain much traction - there are only 39 Jenkins instances running the Literate plugin as of December 2016.\n\nIn terms of the reusable components, we had only made a minimal implementation with some limitations:\n\nVery basic event support - events can only trigger a re-scan of the entire repository.\nThis was acceptable at the time because the only three implementations use a local cache of the remote state so re-scanning is quick.\n\nNo implementation of the SCMFileSystem API.\nAs a result it is not possible for plugins like\nPipeline Multibranch\nto get the Jenkinsfile from the remote repository without needing to checkout the repository into a workspace.\n\nNo documentation on how plugin developers are supposed to implement the SCM API\n\nNo documentation on how plugin developers are supposed to consume the SCM API (if they wanted to do something like Branch API but not the same way as Branch API)\n\nNo documentation on how plugin developers are supposed to implement the Branch API to create their own multi-branch project types\n\nNo documentation on for users on how the Branch API based project types are expected to work.\n\nRoll forward to November 2015 and Jenkins Pipeline got a release of the\nPipeline Multibranch.\nIt seems that pairing Pipeline with Branch API style multi-branch is much more successful than Literate - there are close to 60,000 instances running the pipeline multi-branch plugin as of December 2016.\n\nThere also were two new SCM plugins implementing the SCM API:\n\nGitHub Branch Source Plugin\n\nBitBucket Branch Source Plugin\n\nUnlike the previous implementations of the SCM API, however, these plugins do not maintain a local cache of the repository state.\nRather they make queries via the GitHub / BitBucket REST APIs on demand.\n\nThe above design decision exposed one of the initial MVP compromises of the SCM API plugin: very basic event support.\nUnder the SCM API 1.x model, the only event that an SCMSource can signal is something changed, go look at everything again.\nWhen you are accessing an API that only allows 5,000 API calls per hour, performing a full scan of the entire repository just to pick up a change in one branch does not make optimum usage of that 5,000 calls/hour rate limit.\n\nSo we decided that perhaps the SCM API and Branch API plugins have left their Minimum Viability Experiment state and the corresponding limitations should be addressed.\n\nEnter SCM API 2.0.x and Branch API 2.0.x\n\nSo what has changed in the\nSCM API\n2.0.x and\nBranch API\n2.0.x release lines?\nThese plugin releases include:\n\ndocumentation on how plugin developers are supposed to\nimplement the SCM API\n\ndocumentation on how plugin developers are supposed to\nconsume the SCM API\n(if they wanted to do something like Branch API but not the same way as Branch API)\n\ndocumentation on how plugin developers are supposed to\nimplement the Branch API\nto create their own multi-branch project types\n\ngeneric documentation for users on\nhow Branch API based project types are intended to work\n\na full featured\nevent system\nthat allows implementers to provide fine grained notifications to consumers\n\nlots\nand\nlots\nof new automated tests\n\na mock implementation\nof the SCM API to help consumers of the SCM API test their usage.\n\nIn addition, we have upgraded the following plugins to include the new fine-grained event support:\n\nGit Plugin\n\nMercurial Plugin\n\nOk, that was the good news.\nHere is the bad news.\n\nWe found out that the GitHub Branch Source and BitBucket Branch Source plugins had made invalid assumptions about how to implement the SCM API.\nTo be clear, this was not the plugin developers fault: at the time there was no documentation on how to implement the SCM API.\n\nBut fixing the issues that we found means that you have to be careful about which specific combinations of plugin versions you have installed.\n\nSCM API Plugin\n\nTechnically, the 2.0.x line of this plugin is both API and on-disk compatible with plugins compiled against older version lines.\n\nHowever, the 1.x lines of both the GitHub Branch Source and BitBucket Branch Source plugins have hard-coded assumptions about internal implementation of the SCM API that are no longer valid in the 2.0.x line.\n\nIf you upgrade to SCM API 2.0.x and you have either the GitHub Branch Source or the BitBucket Branch Source plugins and you do not upgrade those instances to the 2.0.x line then your Jenkins instance will fail to start-up correctly.\n\nThe solution is just to upgrade the GitHub Branch Source or the BitBucket Branch Source plugin (as appropriate) to the 2.0.x line.\n\nIf you upgrade the SCM API plugin to the 2.0.x line and do not upgrade the Branch API plugin to the 2.0.x line then you will not get any of the benefits of the new version of the SCM API plugin.\n\nBranch API Plugin\n\nThe 2.0.x line of this plugin makes on-disk file format changes that mean you will be unable to roll back to the 1.x line after an upgrade without restoring the old data files from a back-up.\nTechnically, the API is compatible with plugins compiled against older version lines.\n\nThe 1.x lines of both the GitHub Branch Source and BitBucket Branch Source plugins have implemented hacks that make assumptions about internal implementation of the Branch API that are no longer valid in the 2.0.x line.\n\nThe Pipeline Multibranch plugin made a few minor invalid assumptions about how to implement a Multibranch project type.\nFor example, if you do not upgrade the Pipeline Multibranch plugin in tandem then you will be unable to manually delete an orphaned item before the orphaned item retention strategy runs, which should be significantly less frequently with the new event support.\n\nIf you upgrade to Branch API 2.0.x and you have either the GitHub Branch Source or the BitBucket Branch Source plugins and you do not upgrade those instances to the 2.0.x line then your Jenkins instance will fail to start-up correctly.\n\nThe solution is just to upgrade the GitHub Branch Source or the BitBucket Branch Source plugin (as appropriate) to the 2.0.x line.\n\nGit Plugin\n\nThe new releases of this plugin are both API and on-disk compatible with plugins compiled against the previous releases.\n\nThe 2.0.x lines of both the GitHub Branch Source and BitBucket Branch Source plugins require that you upgrade your Git Plugin to one of the versions that supports SCM API 2.0.x.\nIn general, the required upgrade will be performed automatically when you upgrade your GitHub Branch Source and BitBucket Branch Source plugins.\n\nMercurial Plugin\n\nThe new release of this plugin is both API and on-disk compatible with plugins compiled against the previous releases.\n\nThe 2.0.x line of the BitBucket Branch Source plugins require that you upgrade your Mercurial Plugin to the 2.0.x line.\nIn general, the required upgrade will be performed automatically when you upgrade your  BitBucket Branch Source plugins.\n\nBitBucket Branch Source Plugin\n\nThe 2.0.x line of this plugin makes on-disk file format changes that mean you will be unable to roll back to the 1.x line after an upgrade without restoring the old data files from a back-up.\n\nGitHub Branch Source Plugin\n\nThe 2.0.x line of this plugin makes on-disk file format changes that mean you will be unable to roll back to the 1.x line after an upgrade without restoring the old data files from a back-up.\n\nIf you upgrade to GitHub Branch Source 2.0.x and you have the GitHub Organization Folders plugin installed, you must upgrade that plugin to the tombstone release.\n\nGitHub Organization Folders Plugin\n\nThe functionality of this plugin has been migrated to the GitHub Branch Source plugin.\nYou will need to upgrade to the tombstone release in order to ensure all the data has been migrated to the classes in the GitHub Branch Source plugin.\n\nOnce you have upgraded to the tombstone version and all GitHub Organization Folders have had a full scan completed successfully, you can disable and uninstall the GitHub Organization Folders plugin.\nThere will be no more releases of this plugin after the tombstone.\nThe tombstone is only required for data migration.\n\nSummary for busy Jenkins Administrators\n\nUpgrading should make multi-branch projects much better.\nWhen you are ready to upgrade you must ensure that you upgrade all the required plugins.\nIf you miss some, just upgrade them and restart to fix the issue.\n\nFolders Plugin\n\n5.16 5.17 or newer\n\nSCM API Plugin\n\n2.0.1 2.0.2 or newer\n\nBranch API Plugin\n\n2.0.0 2.0.2 or newer\n\nGit Plugin\n\nEither 2.6.2 2.6.4 or newer in the 2.6.x line or 3.0.2 3.0.4 or newer\n\nMercurial Plugin\n\n2.0.0 or newer\n\nGitHub Branch Source Plugin\n\n2.0.0 2.0.1 or newer\n\nBitBucket Branch Source Plugin\n\n2.0.0 2.0.2 or newer\n\nGitHub Organization Folders Plugin\n\n1.6\n\nPipeline Multibranch Plugin\n\n2.10 2.12 or newer\n\nIf you are using the Blue Ocean plugin\n\nBlue Ocean Plugin\n\n1.0.0-b22 or newer\n\nOther plugins that may require updating:\n\nGitHub API Plugin\n\n1.84 or newer\n\nGitHub Plugin\n\n1.25.0 or newer\n\nAfter an upgrade you will see the data migration warning (see the screenshot in JENKINS-41608 for an example) this is normal and expected.\nThe unreadable data will be removed by the next scan / index or can be removed manually using the Discard Unreadable Data button.\nThe warning will disappear on the next restart after the unreadable data has been removed.\n\nSummary for busy Jenkins users\n\nSCM API 2.0.x adds fine-grained event support.\nThis should significantly improve the responsiveness of multi-branch projects.\nThis should significantly reduce your GitHub API rate limit usage.\n\nIf you are using the\nGitHub Branch Source\nor\nGitHub Organization Folders\nplugins then upgrading will significantly reduce the API calls made by Jenkins to GitHub.\n\nIf you are using any of the upgraded SCM plugins (e.g. Git, Mercurial, GitHub Branch Source, BitBucket Branch Source) then upgrading will significantly improve the responsiveness to push event notifications.\n\nSummary for busy SCM plugin developers\n\nYou should read the new\ndocumentation\non how plugin developers are supposed to implement the SCM API\n\nWhere to now dear Literate Plugin\n\nThe persistent reader may be wondering what happens now to the Literate plugin.\n\nFor me, the logical heir of the Literate Plugin is the\nPipeline Model Definition plugin.\nThis new plugin has the advantage of an easy to read pipeline syntax with the extra functionality that I suspect was preventing people from adopting Literate.\n\nThe good news is that the Pipeline Model Definition already has 5000 installations as of December 2016 and I expect up-take to keep on growing.","title":"SCM API turns 2.0 and what that

The agent any and\nagent none configurations work the same as previously, but label, docker\nand dockerfile now look like the following:\n\nJust specifying a label is simple.\n\n// Declarative //\nagent {\n    label \"some-label\"\n}\n// Script //\n\nIf you’re just specifying a Docker image, you can use this simple syntax.\n\n// Declarative //\nagent {\n    docker \"ubuntu:16.04\"\n}\n// Script //\n\nWhen you are specifying a label or other arguments, docker looks like this:\n\n// Declarative //\nagent {\n    docker {\n        image \"ubuntu:16.04\"\n        label \"docker-label\"\n        args \"-v /tmp:/tmp -p 8000:8000\"\n    }\n}\n// Script //\n\nWhen you’re building an image from \"Dockerfile\" in your repository and\ndon’t care what node is used or have additional arguments, you can again\nuse a simple syntax.\n\n// Declarative //\nagent {\n    dockerfile true\n}\n// Script //\n\nWhen you’re building an image from a different file, or have a label or other\narguments, use the following syntax:\n\n// Declarative //\nagent {\n    dockerfile {\n        filename \"OtherDockerfile\"\n        label \"docker-label\"\n        args \"-v /tmp:/tmp -p 8000:8000\"\n    }\n}\n// Script //\n\nImproved \"when\" conditions\n\nWe introduced the when section a couple releases ago, but have made some\nchanges to its syntax here in 0.8.1. We wanted to add some simpler ways to\nspecify common conditions, and that required we re-work the syntax accordingly.\n\nBranch\n\nOne of the most common conditions is running a stage only if you’re on a\nspecific branch. You can also use wildcards like \"*/master\".\n\n// Declarative //\nwhen {\n    branch \"master\"\n}\n// Script //\n\nEnvironment\n\nAnother built-in condition is the environment condition, which checks to see\nif a given environment variable is set to a given value.\n\n// Declarative //\nwhen {\n    environment name: \"SOME_ENV_VAR\", value: \"SOME_VALUE\"\n}\n// Script //\n\nExpression\n\nLastly, there’s the expression condition, which resolves an arbitrary\nPipeline expression. If the return value of that expression isn’t false or\nnull, the stage will execute.\n\n// Declarative //\nwhen {\n    expression {\n        echo \"Should I run?\"\n        return \"foo\" == \"bar\"\n    }\n}\n// Script //\n\n\"options\" replaces \"properties\" and \"wrappers\"\n\nWe’ve renamed the properties section to options, due to needing to add new\nDeclarative-specific options and to cut down on confusion. The options section\nis now where you’ll put general Pipeline options like buildDiscarder,\nDeclarative-specific options like skipDefaultCheckout, and block-scoped steps\nthat should wrap the execution of the entire build, like timeout or\ntimestamps.\n\n// Declarative //\n\noptions {\n    buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr:'1'))\n    skipDefaultCheckout()\n    timeout(time: 5, unit: 'MINUTES')\n}\n// Script //\n\nHeading towards 1.0!\n\nWhile we may still add more functionality to the Declarative Pipeline syntax,\nwe won’t be making any changes to existing syntax for the 1.0 release. This\nmeans that any pipelines you write against the 0.8.1 syntax will keep working\nfor the foreseeable future without any changes. So if you’re already using\nDeclarative Pipelines, make sure to update your `Jenkinsfile`s after upgrading\nto 0.8.1, and if you haven’t been using Declarative Pipelines yet, install the\nPipeline: Model Definition plugin and\ngive them a try!","title":"Declarative Pipeline Syntax Beta 2 release","tags":["plugins","pipeline"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"abayer","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Andrew was a core committer to Hudson and the author of numerous plugins.</p>\n</div>","id":"abayer","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Andrew Bayer","slug":"/blog/authors/abayer","twitter":"abayer"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b6d5d789-c4f4-5f71-bda6-b5ab5196b7e9","slug":"/blog/2017/01/11/jenkins-world-2017-cfp/","strippedHtml":"The largest Jenkins event, Jenkins\nWorld is coming to San Francisco, California on August 28 - 31, 2017, at the\nMarriott Marquis.
