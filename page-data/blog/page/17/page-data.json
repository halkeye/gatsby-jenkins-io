This presents a couple of challenges especially when you try to run Jenkins in the cloud:\n\nAs the number of artifacts grow, your Jenkins controller will run out of disk space. Eventually, performance can be impacted.\n\nFrequent transfer of files between agents and controller may cause load, CPU or network issues which are always hard to diagnose.\n\nSeveral existing plugins allow you to manage your artifacts externally. To use these plugins, you need to know how they work and perform specific steps in your job’s configuration. And if you are new to Jenkins, you may find it hard to follow existing samples in Jenkins tutorial like Recording tests and artifacts.\n\nSo, if you are running Jenkins in Azure, you can consider automatically managing new artifacts on Azure Storage. The new Azure Artifact Management plugin allows you to store artifacts in Azure blob storage and simplify your existing Jenkins jobs that contain Jenkins general artifacts management steps. This approach will give you all the advantages of a cloud storage, with less effort on your part to maintain your Jenkins instance.\n\nConfiguration\n\nAzure storage account\n\nFirst, you need to have an Azure Storage account. You can skip this section if you already have one. Otherwise, create an Azure storage account for storing your artifacts. Follow this tutorial to quickly create one. Then navigate to Access keys in the Settings section to get the storage account name and one of its keys.\n\nExisting Jenkins instance\n\nFor existing Jenkins instance, make sure you install the Azure Artifact Manager plugin. Then you can go to your Jenkins System Configuration page and locate the Artifact Management for Builds section. Select the Add button to configure an Azure Artifact Storage. Fill in the following parameters:\n\nStorage Type: Azure storage supports several storage types like blob, file, queue etc. This plugin currently supports blob storage only.\n\nStorage Credentials: Credentials used to authenticate with Azure storage. If you do not have an existing Azure storage credential in you Jenkins credential store, click the Add button and choose Microsoft Azure Storage kind to create one.\n\nAzure Container Name: The container under which to keep your artifacts. If the container name does not exist in the blob, this plugin automatically creates one for you when artifacts are uploaded to the blob.\n\nBase Prefix: Prefix added to your artifact paths stored in your container, a forward slash will be parsed as a folder. In the following screenshot, all your artifacts will be stored in the “staging” folder in the container “Jenkins”.\n\nNew Jenkins instance\n\nIf you need to create a new Jenkins controller, follow this tutorial to quickly create an Jenkins instance on Azure. In the Integration Settings section, you can now set up Azure Artifact Manager directly. Note that you can change any of the configuration after your Jenkins instance is created. Azure storage account and credential, in this case, are still prerequisites.\n\nUsage\n\nJenkins Pipeline\n\nHere are a few commonly used artifact related steps in pipeline jobs; all are supported to push artifacts to the Azure Storage blob specified.\n\nYou can use archiveArtifacts step to archive target artifacts into Azure storage. For more details about archiveArtifacts step, see the Jenkins archiveArtifacts setp documentation.\n\nnode {\n  //...\n  stage('Archive') {\n    archiveArtifacts \"pattern\"\n  }\n}\n\nYou can use the unarchive step to retrieve the artifacts from Azure storage. For more details about unarchive step, please see unarchive step documentation.\n\nnode {\n  //...\n  stage('Unarchive') {\n    unarchive mapping: [\"pattern\": '.']\n  }\n}\n\nTo save a set of files so that you can use them later in the same build (generally on another node or workspace), you can use stash step to store files into Azure storage for later use. Stash step documentation can be found here.\n\nnode {\n  //...\n  stash name: 'name', includes: '*'\n}\n\nYou can use unstash step to retrieve the files saved with stash step from Azure storage to the local workspace. Unstash documentation can be found here.\n\nnode {\n  //...\n  unstash 'name'\n}\n\nFreeStyle Job\n\nFor a FreeStyle Jenkins job, you can use Archive the artifacts step in Post-build Actions to upload the target artifacts into Azure storage.\n\nThis Azure Artifact Manager plugin is also compatible with some other popular management plugins, such as the Copy Artifact plugin. You can still use these plugins without changing anything.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions when using Azure Artifact Manager plugin, you can file a ticket on Jenkins JIRA for the azure-artifact-manager-plugin component.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Azure Artifact Manager enables a more cloud-native Jenkins. This is the first step in the Cloud Native project. We have a long way to go to get Jenkins to run on cloud environments as a true “Cloud Native” application. We need help and welcome your participation and contributions to make Jenkins better.

With Mr. Zheng we made a change so the plugin now is able to check the difference in code coverage between pull requests and target branches.\n\nIn lots of projects it is a common practice to track if unit tests code coverage doesn’t decrease. So, with this plugin, you may skip separate services that track code coverage and have this feature right in your favorite CI system.\n\nHow it works\n\nWhen you build a PR in Jenkins, using plugins like Github or Bitbucket Branch Source, that use SCM API Plugin, your PR knows what target branch commit it is based on. (The commit may change because of Discover pull requests from origin strategies). To calculate the diff, when you publish your coverage from PR, it looks for the target branch build for the commit that your PR was based on. If it finds the build on the target branch, it looks for any published code coverage for this target branch build. In case the build has it, the plugin calculates the percentage diff for the line coverage and shows it on the pull request build page. Also, it gives you a link to the target branch build that was used for the comparison.\n\nThat it how it looks like:\n\nDecreased coverage\n\nIncreased coverage\n\nHow to enable code coverage diff for pull requests\n\nTo enable this behavior you need to publish your code coverage with the calculateDiffForChangeRequests flag equals true, like this:\n.Jenkinsfile\n\nnode(...) {\n  ...\n  // Here we are using the istanbulCoberturaAdapter\n  publishCoverage adapters: [istanbulCoberturaAdapter('cobertura-coverage.xml')],\n    sourceFileResolver: sourceFiles('NEVER_STORE'),\n    calculateDiffForChangeRequests: true\n\n  ...\n}\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nIf you have some questions about this behavior, please ask me in email.\n\nYou are free to contribute to this plugin to make it better for everyone. There are a lot of interesting features that can be added and issues that can be solved. Also, you can write some new plugins for other code coverage formats that use the Code Coverage API plugin as a base.\n\nHere is the repo of the plugin - Code Coverage API Plugin\n\nThank you.","title":"Jenkins code coverage diff in pull requests","tags":["plugins","codecoverage"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/6ea2a73294a8396d74efba91c53e1bfe/19e71/asavanchuk.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/6ea2a73294a8396d74efba91c53e1bfe/77b35/asavanchuk.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/6ea2a73294a8396d74efba91c53e1bfe/d4a57/asavanchuk.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/6ea2a73294a8396d74efba91c53e1bfe/19e71/asavanchuk.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/6ea2a73294a8396d74efba91c53e1bfe/68974/asavanchuk.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/6ea2a73294a8396d74efba91c53e1bfe/ef6ff/asavanchuk.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/6ea2a73294a8396d74efba91c53e1bfe/8257c/asavanchuk.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/6ea2a73294a8396d74efba91c53e1bfe/6766a/asavanchuk.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/6ea2a73294a8396d74efba91c53e1bfe/22bfc/asavanchuk.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/6ea2a73294a8396d74efba91c53e1bfe/asavanchuk.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"tempora-mutantur","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Software developer from Minsk, Belarus.</p>\n</div>","id":"asavanchuk","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Aliaksei Savanchuk","slug":"/blog/authors/asavanchuk/","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9f73ac2f-d418-5bf3-8f3c-f90ae712af6e","slug":"/blog/2019/07/17/DevOps-World-Jenkins-World-2019-San-Francisco-Lunch-Demos/","strippedHtml":"If you’re looking for more opportunities to learn Jenkins and Jenkins X during the lunch hours while at DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco , come join us at the Jenkins and Jenkins X Community Booth!\n\nIf you don’t yet have your pass for DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco , and don’t want to miss out on the fun, you can get yours using JWFOSS for a 30% discount.\n\nDuring lunch hours we are scheduling the following demo briefs at the Jenkins and Jenkins X Community Booth:\n\nWednesday  August 14, 2019\n\n12:10 - 12:25pm \tFaster Git Mark Waite\n\nAttendees will learn the techniques they can use with Jenkins to make their systems clone and update git repositories faster and with less disc space.\n\n12:25 - 12:40pm\tObservability in Jenkins X Oscar Medina\n\nIf you are using Jenkins X, you’re already building at rapid pace.

A new solution was needed to detect pipeline changes and show these changes in Jenkins.\nSo we developed Pipeline Configuration History.\n\nDuring every pipeline run the Jenkinsfile and related shared libraries are saved in the builds directory of the job.\nPipeline Configuration History saves changes of the pipeline files between the last run and the previous run as history events.\nTherefore when a pipeline job ceases to build successfully, you can check if something has changed on any used pipeline file.\nYou can also see the build where changes occurred.\n\nBecause a pipeline configuration can consist of several files where changes could have occurred, only files with changes between two builds are shown in the diff.\nThat makes the whole thing more compact and effective:\n\nBut sometimes you may want to show more than the differences between pipeline files.  You may want to see which pipeline files are in use or the content of those files when they were used.\nSo it’s possible to view all files and their content.\nIf required you can download them as well:\n\nConclusion\n\nWe use Pipeline Configuration History successfully in production. It has helped us from the very first day as we solved problems that occurred due to pipeline configuration changes.\nPipeline Configuration History won’t replace Job Configuration History.\nThe plugins have different use cases.\nMany times small changes on job or pipeline configurations also have big impacts.\nBecause of the correlation in time between changes of job or pipeline configurations and different build behavior, it is now possible to substantially reduce the time and effort to analyze build failures.\nThe Job Configuration History and Pipeline Configuration History plugins let us help our users in consulting and in solving issues.  We resolve problems much faster through easy access to the configuration history of jobs.  These plugins are essential for our daily work.","title":"Introducing the Pipeline Configuration History Plugin","tags":["pipeline","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"Jochen-A-Fuerbacher","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jochen is a software developer for development infrastructure at 1&amp;1 Telecommunication.\nHe has been working with Jenkins for many years and develops some Jenkins plugins.</p>\n</div>","id":"jochenafuerbacher","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Jochen A.

My project for Google Summer of Code 2019 is Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features. This is the first time I have contributed for Jenkins and I am very excited to announce the features that have been done in Phase 1.\n\nProject Introduction\n\nCurrent version of Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin requires users to manually configure the entire system which includes Zookeeper, Kafka and remoting agents. It also doesn’t support dynamic agent provisioning so scalability is harder to achieve. My project aims to solve two problems:\n\nOut-of-the-box solution to provision Apache Kafka cluster.\n\nDynamic agent provisioning in a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nCurrent State\n\nKubernetes connector with credentials supported.\n\nApache Kafka provisioning in Kubernetes feature is fully implemented.\n\nHelm chart is partially implemented.\n\nApache Kafka provisioning in Kubernetes\n\nThis feature is part of 2.0 version so it is not yet released officially. You can try out the feature by using the Experimental Update Center to update to 2.0.0-alpha version or building directly from master branch:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting-kafka-plugin.git\ncd remoting-kafka-plugin/plugin\nmvn hpi:run\n\nOn the Global Configuration page, users can input Kubernetes server information and credentials. Then they can start Apache Kafka with only one button click.\n\nWhen users click Start Kafka on Kubernetes button, Jenkins will create a Kubernetes client from the information and then apply Zookeeper and Kafka YAML specification files from resources.\n\nHelm Chart\n\nHelm chart for Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin is based on stable/jenkins chart and incubator/kafka chart. As of now, the chart is still a Work in Progress because it is still waiting for Cloud API implementation in Phase 2. However, you can check out the demo chart with a single standalone Remoting Kafka Agent:\n\ngit clone -b demo-helm-phase-1 https://github.com/longngn/remoting-kafka-plugin.git\ncd remoting-kafka-plugin\nK8S_NODE=./helm/jenkins-remoting-kafka/do.sh start\n\nThe command do.sh start will do the following steps:\n\nInstall the chart (with Jenkins and Kafka).\n\nLaunch a Kafka computer on Jenkins controller by applying the following JCasC.\n\njenkins:\n  nodes:\n    - permanent:\n        name: \"test\"\n        remoteFS: \"/home/jenkins\"\n        launcher:\n          kafka: {}\n\nLaunch a single Remoting Kafka Agent pod.\n\nYou can check the chart state by running kubectl, for example:\n\n$ kubectl get all -n demo-helm\nNAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/demo-jenkins-998bcdfd4-tjmjs        2/2     Running   0          6m30s\npod/demo-jenkins-remoting-kafka-agent   1/1     Running   0          4m10s\npod/demo-kafka-0                        1/1     Running   0          6m30s\npod/demo-zookeeper-0                    1/1     Running   0          6m30s\n\nNAME                              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE\nservice/demo-0-external           NodePort    10.106.254.187 19092:31090/TCP              6m30s\nservice/demo-jenkins              NodePort    10.101.84.33 8080:31465/TCP               6m31s\nservice/demo-jenkins-agent        ClusterIP   10.97.169.65 50000/TCP                    6m31s\nservice/demo-kafka                ClusterIP   10.106.248.10 9092/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-kafka-headless       ClusterIP   None 9092/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-zookeeper            ClusterIP   10.109.222.63 2181/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-zookeeper-headless   ClusterIP   None 2181/TCP,3888/TCP,2888/TCP   6m31s\n\nNAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/demo-jenkins   1/1     1            1           6m30s\n\nNAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\nreplicaset.apps/demo-jenkins-998bcdfd4   1         1         1       6m30s\n\nNAME                              READY   AGE\nstatefulset.apps/demo-kafka       1/1     6m30s\nstatefulset.apps/demo-zookeeper   1/1     6m30s\n\nNext Phase Plan\n\nImplement Cloud API to provision Remoting Kafka Agent.

Jobs that run outside of configured working hours are held until the next allowable build time.\n\nFor the first code phase at Google Summer of Code, I’ve been working on Working Hours Project, which needed improvements on usability.\n\nRather than classical Jelly pages, React seems to be more prefered when we want to design a much customized UI with a huge amount of libraries we could use, especially the open source components such as date pickers.\n\nBut we have to face a challenge of the integration of React and Jenkins, which I’m currently working on.\n\nAchievements For The First Code Phase\n\nFor the first code phase, we are focusing on the UI improvements, we’ve achieved following major improvements:\n\nA standalone webapp which could be then integrated.\n\nSlider for choosing a time range.\n\nMore fields when setting a excluded date.\n\nPresets for choosing a excluded date.\n\nA Jenkins styling UI.\n\nHow We Integrate React Into Jenkins\n\nA solution doc for integration could be found at\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1JLRCDg9JNBWR0Dfq8w3pTI9mrl6i9JU29pBoH6bO0J8\n\nAt first, we found BlueOcean is a great example for using React in Jenkins, but yet it’s not a choice for common development with plugins. So we need to find out another way to integrate.\n\nHere are the steps to do the integration:\n\nA mount point in your jelly file, usually it’s a element with a unique id.\n\nWrite your React Application, but need to set the mount point to the id you set above.\n\nCopy the output after you build the Project into the plugin’s webapp dir.\n\nAdd your files using a script tag in your jelly file.\n\nOnce we are using React, the traditional jelly request won’t be available anymore, another way to process requests will be using stapler. You can define a process function like below.\n[source, java]\n\npublic HttpResponse doDynamic(StaplerRequest request) {\n        if (config == null) {\n            config = ExtensionList.lookup(WorkingHoursPlugin.class).get(0);\n        }\n        String restOfPath = request.getRestOfPath();\n        String[] pathTokens = restOfPath.split(\"/\");\n        List params = new ArrayList<>();\n        switch (params.get(0)) {\n            case \"list-excluded-dates\":\n                return listExcludedDate(request);\n            case \"set-excluded-dates\":\n                return setExcludedDates(request);\n            case \"list-time-ranges\":\n                return listTimeRanges(request);\n            case \"set-time-ranges\":\n                return setTimeRanges(request);\n        }\n    }\n\nRun Our Application\n\nIf you would like to take a look at our plugin, you can go to the repo\nworking-hours-plugin\n\nJust follow the README file, then you could run a copy of your working hours plugin.\n\nScreenshots\n\nThe current plugin’s outlook is a bit simple and the plugin is a bit unconvinient for use.\n\nOne of the problems is that if we want to input a excluded date, it’ll be a string in a constant format like 15/9/2019, but the new UI choosed React so we could use a datepicker to improve this.\n\nCurrent Plugin\n\nNew (Time Ranges)\n\nNew (Exclude Dates)\n\nHelpful links\n\nIf you have any questions or advices, we are glad to hear from you.\n\nSeveral useful links are listed below:\n\nDevelop Repo\n\nMain Repo\n\nDesign Doc\n\nDoc for React Integration Solution\n\nGitter Chat\n\nSlides for Phase 1 Demo\n\nVideo Recording for Phase 1","title":"GSOC Phase 1 Updates On Working Hours Plugin","tags":["react","plugins","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/77b35/jackshen.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/d4a57/jackshen.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/14734/jackshen.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ef6ff/jackshen.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/8257c/jackshen.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/f4bd7/jackshen.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/65cd2/jackshen.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":129}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/jackshen.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"ShenJack","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Shen is a student from Beijing Forestry University.

This issue made it difficult to quickly identify why a build was unstable, and forced users to read through builds logs and the Jenkinsfile to figure out what actually happened.\n\nIn order to fix this issue, we introduced a new Pipeline API that can be used to attach additional result information to individual Pipeline steps. Visualization tools like Blue Ocean use this new API when deciding how a given stage should be displayed. Steps like junit that used to set only the overall build result now additionally use the new API to set step-level result information. We created the new unstable and warnError steps so that Pipeline authors with more complicated use cases can still take advantage of this new API.\n\nThe core fixes for the issue are present in the following plugins, all of which require Jenkins 2.138.4 or newer:\n\nPipeline: API 2.34\n\nPipeline: Basic Steps 2.18 (requires a simultaneous update to Pipeline: Groovy 2.70)\n\nPipeline: Graph Analysis 1.10\n\nPipeline: Declarative 1.3.9\n\nBlue Ocean 1.17.0\n\nHere is a screenshot from Blue Ocean of a Pipeline using the unstable step where only the failing stage is marked as unstable:\n\nExamples\n\nHere are some examples of how to update your Pipelines to use the new improvements:\n\nUse the new warnError step to catch errors and mark the build and stage as unstable. warnError requires a single String parameter, which is a message to log when an error is caught. When warnError catches an error, it logs the message  and the error and sets the build and stage result to unstable. Using it looks like this:\n\nwarnError('Script failed!') {\n  sh('false')\n}\n\nUse the new unstable step to set the build and stage result to unstable. This step can be used as a direct replacement for currentBuild.result = 'UNSTABLE', and may be useful in cases where warnError is not flexible enough. unstable requires a single String parameter, which is a message to log when the step runs. Using it might look like this:\n\ntry {\n  sh('false')\n} catch (ex) {\n  unstable('Script failed!')\n}\n\nJUnit Plugin : Update to version 1.28 or newer to pick up fixes for the junit step so that it correctly marks the stage as unstable.\n\nWarnings Next Generation Plugin : Update to version 5.2.0 or newer to pick up fixes for the publishIssues and recordIssues steps so that they correctly mark the stage as unstable.\n\nOther Plugins : If your Pipeline is marked as unstable by a step in another plugin, please file a new issue with the component set to that plugin (after checking for duplicates), clearly describing which step has the problem and under what circumstances it occurs, and link to the developer section of this post as a reference for how the maintainer might be able to address the problem.\n\nLimitations\n\nIf you do not migrate to the unstable or warnError steps, or update plugins that set the build result to versions that integrate with the new API, then in cases where the build is unstable, Blue Ocean will not show any stages as unstable.\n\nEven after these changes, currentBuild.result continues to refer only to the overall build result. Unfortunately, it was not possible to adapt the currentBuild global variable to make it track step or stage-level results, since it is implemented as a global variable, which means it does not have any step-level context through which it could use the new API.\n\nPipeline Stage View Plugin has not yet been updated to use the new API, so these changes do not affect the visualization it provides.\n\nHistory\n\nJenkins Pipeline steps can complete in one of two ways: successfully, by returning a (possibly null) result, or unsuccessfully, by throwing an exception. When a step fails by throwing an exception, that exception propagates throughout the Pipeline until another step or Groovy code catches it, or it reaches the top level of the Pipeline, which causes the Pipeline itself to fail. Depending on the type of exception thrown, the final result of the Pipeline may be something other than failure (for example in some cases it will be aborted). Because of the way the exception propagates, it is easy for tools like Blue Ocean to identify steps (and therefore stages) which failed due to an exception.\n\nIn order for Pipelines to be able to interact with established Jenkins APIs, it was also necessary for Pipeline builds to have an overall build result that can be modified during the build. Among other things, this allows Pipelines to use build steps and wrappers that were originally written for use in Freestyle projects.\n\nIn some cases, it is desirable for a Pipeline step to be able to complete successfully so that the rest of the Pipeline continues normal execution, but for it to be able to note that some kind of error occurred so that visualizations are able to identify that something went wrong with the step, even though it didn’t fail completely. A good example of this is the junit step. This step looks at specified test results, and if there were any failures, marks the overall build result as unstable. This kind of behavior is problematic for visualization tools like Blue Ocean, because the step completed successfully, and there is no programmatic way to associate the overall build result with the step that ended up setting that result.\n\nLooking at JENKINS-39203 again, we see that there were essentially two options for the visualization. If the overall build result was unstable, either all steps that completed successfully could be shown as unstable, because they may have been the step that caused the build to become unstable, or they could be shown as successful, because we have no way to relate the setting of the build result to a specific step. In the end, the first option was chosen.\n\nTo work around this issue, some users tried to do things like throw exceptions and add try/catch blocks around stages that handle exceptions so that Blue Ocean would be able to use the exceptions to mark step and stage results as desired, and then by catching the exception the Pipeline would be able to continue normal execution. These kinds of workarounds were hard to understand, fragile, and did not work well (if at all) for Declarative Pipelines.\n\nDevelopers\n\nIf you are a developer of a plugin that integrates with Pipeline using a step, and want to take advantage of the new API so that your step can report an non-successful result without throwing an exception, please see this post to the Jenkins Developers mailing list, and respond there if you have any questions.","title":"Jenkins Pipeline Stage Result Visualization Improvements","tags":["pipeline","blueocean"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"dwnusbaum","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Devin has worked on various areas of Jenkins for the past two years as a software engineer at CloudBees.

We instead decided to start by converting the\ninstall-plugins.sh bash script in Jenkins Docker to Java.\nThere are several issues with the install-plugins.sh script - namely, that it is a bash script and has limited extensibility.\nFurthermore, it does not retrieve all of the most-up-to-date update center metadata.\n\nAlpha Release Details\n\nMimicking what was done in the install-plugins.sh script from the official Jenkins Docker image, the new plugin management library takes in a list of plugins, their versions,\nand/or urls from which to download the plugins, and downloads the requested plugins and their dependencies. The plugins are downloaded from the update center\nto a specified directory, and can then be loaded into Jenkins. Currently, the plugins to be downloaded can be specified via a plugins.txt file and/or the -plugins cli option, but we plan to further expand the input formats that can be accepted.\nCustom version specifiers for different update centers are also supported.\n\nThe library will first check if any of the requested plugins are currently either installed in the user-specified download location or user-specified Jenkins war file.\nAlready installed plugins will be ignored or upgraded if a higher version is requested or required as a dependency.  After determining the plugin download URL, the library\nwill download the plugins and resolve and download their dependencies.\n\nThis is just the beginning: the plugin manager library and cli tool are very much still a work in progress.\nFor the most up-to-date information on CLI options and how to run the tool, see the repository README.md.\nMore robust input parsing, support for security warnings and available updates, Docker integration, and additional features coming soon!\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nFeel free to reach out through\nthe Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list.
