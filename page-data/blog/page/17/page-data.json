As a result, teams struggle with keeping the status of work updated and understanding the overall health of their delivery pipeline.\n\nTo solve this problem, I am excited to announce that we built an official Jenkins plugin for Jira Software Cloud. The plugin automatically associates build and deployment information from Jenkins with relevant Jira issues and exposes key information about your pipeline across Jira issues, boards and via JQL. This means you can use Jira Software to automatically update and track issues through your complete development pipeline, from backlog to release.\n\nI hope this plugin adds value to you and your team. If you are interested in contributing or forking this plug-in you can head over to our project on the Jenkins GitHub repo to get started.\n\nBetter collaboration between teams\n\nThis new information view is so powerful because historically it was dispersed across multiple tools only accessible to a few members of your team. Now anyone involved in the software delivery process can self-serve this information. For example, product managers, QA, and support teams can view which features have been deployed to customers and which are still waiting in staging environments.\n\nWith better information sharing between tools in your delivery stack, you can also improve cross-collaboration between teams. Teams such as QA and operations can collaborate in the software teams next sprint. For example, you can use build information in Jira Software to create a workflow between QA and developers and create a rapid feedback loop for testing at any point in your development process.\n\nUse Jira’s Querying Language for advanced views\n\nIn addition to building better ways to collaborate, these integrations also give your team deeper insight into the development pipeline from within Jira Software. You can now create powerful views into your delivery pipeline with JQL queries across multiple connected tools. For example, you can write a custom JQL query to report all Jira issues that have been deployed to production but still have an open PR.\n\ndeploymentEnvironmentType ~ “production“ AND development[pullrequests].open\n\nGet started\n\nIn Jira Software Cloud\n\nCreate OAuth credentials in Jira for Jenkins\n\nNavigate to Jira home > Jira settings > Apps.\n\nSelect OAuth credentials.\n\nSelect Create credentials.\n\nEnter the following details:\n\nApp name - Jenkins\n\nApp logo - A URL to the Jenkins logo, which will be used as an icon in the list of credentials. Eg: https://jenkins.yourcompany.com/logo.png\n\nServer base URL - The URL to your Jenkins server. Eg: https://jenkins.yourcompany.com\n\nIn Jenkins\n\nInstall the Jenkins plugin\n\nLogin to your Jenkins server and navigate to the Plugin Manager.\n\nSelect the 'Available' tab and search for 'Atlassian Jira Software Cloud' as the plugin name then install it.\n\nThe open-source plugin is hosted in the Jenkins GitHub account. You can check it out here.\n\nSet up Jenkins credentials\n\nIn Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System screen and scroll to the Jira Software Cloud integration section.\n\nSelect Add Jira Cloud Site > Jira Cloud Site. The Site name, ClientID, and Secret fields display.\n\nEnter the following details:\n\nSite name: The URL for your Jira Cloud site, for example yourcompany.atlassian.net.\n\nClient ID: Copy from OAuth credentials screen (Client ID column).\n\nSecret: Select Add > Jenkins.\n\nFor Kind, select Secret text.\n\nFor Secret, copy from OAuth credentials screen (Secret column).\n\nFor Description, provide a helpful description\n\nSelect Test settings to make sure your credentials are valid for your Jira site.\n\nHow to use the plugin\n\nTo start using the integration:\n\nGo into a specific pipeline in Jenkins ( Note: Your pipeline must be a 'Multibranch Pipeline' ).\n\nFrom the left-hand menu, select Pipeline Syntax.\n\nIn the Snippet Generator, select jiraSendDeploymentInfo or jiraSendBuildInfo from the dropdown list of Sample Steps and fill in the relevant details.\n\nSelect Generate Pipeline Script and copy/paste the output into your Jenkinsfile on the relevant Repository you are using. This will be used to notify Jira when you run that pipeline on that repo.\n\nFor sending build information\n\nThis is an example snippet of a very simple ‘build’ stage set up in a Jenkinsfile. After the pipeline is run, it will post the build information to your Jira Cloud site by looking at the branch name. If there is a Jira issue key (e.g. “TEST-123”) in the branch name, it will send the data over to Jira.\n\nJenkinsfile example\n\npipeline {\n     agent any\n     stages {\n         stage('Build') {\n             steps {\n                 echo 'Building...'\n             }\n             post {\n                 always {\n                     jiraSendBuildInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net'\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n     }\n }\n\nFor sending deployment information\n\nThis is an example snippet of two stages that run on any change to the staging or master branch. Again, we use a post step to send deployment data to Jira and the relevant issues. Here, the environmentId, environmentName, and environmentType need to be set to whatever you want to appear in Jira.\n\nJenkinsfile example\n\npipeline {\n     agent any\n     stages {\n         stage('Deploy - Staging') {\n             when {\n                 branch 'master'\n             }\n             steps {\n                 echo 'Deploying to Staging from master...'\n             }\n             post {\n                 always {\n                     jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-stg-1', environmentName: 'us-stg-1', environmentType: 'staging'\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n         stage('Deploy - Production') {\n            when {\n                branch 'master'\n            }\n            steps {\n                echo 'Deploying to Production from master...'\n            }\n            post {\n                always {\n                    jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-prod-1', environmentName: 'us-prod-1', environmentType: 'production'\n                }\n            }\n         }\n     }\n }\n\nThe entire Jenkinsfile may look something like this. This is only meant to represent an example of what the Jira snippets could look like within a stage or step.\n\nJenkinsfile example\n\npipeline {\n     agent any\n     stages {\n         stage('Build') {\n             steps {\n                 echo 'Building...'\n             }\n             post {\n                 always {\n                     jiraSendBuildInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net'\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n         stage('Deploy - Staging') {\n             when {\n                 branch 'master'\n             }\n             steps {\n                 echo 'Deploying to Staging from master...'\n             }\n             post {\n                 always {\n                     jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-stg-1', environmentName: 'us-stg-1', environmentType: 'staging'\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n         stage('Deploy - Production') {\n            when {\n                branch 'master'\n            }\n            steps {\n                echo 'Deploying to Production from master...'\n            }\n            post {\n                always {\n                    jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-prod-1', environmentName: 'us-prod-1', environmentType: 'production'\n                }\n            }\n         }\n     }\n }\n\nQuestions or feedback?\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact Atlassian support and they will route it to the correct team to help you.","title":"Introducing the Jira Software plugin for Jenkins","tags":["jira","plugin","pipeline"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"rafalmyslek","html":"","id":"rafalmyslek","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rafal Myslek","slug":"/blog/authors/rafalmyslek","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ddc369d5-a5e4-57f5-8fb7-5ebe49126b06","slug":"/blog/2019/08/30/jenkins-cli/","strippedHtml":"As a developer, I usually use Jenkins like this:\n\nFind a job which is related with my current work\n\nTrigger that job\n\nCheck the output of the build log\n\nSometimes, I might need to check the update center. Maybe a new plugin is needed, or I need to update an existing plugin.\nOr, I want to upload a plugin from my computer. For all these cases, I just don’t need a UI or even a browser.\nI like to use a CLI to complete most of my tasks. For example, I use kubectl to manage my Kubernetes cluster,\nto create or modify the kubernetes resources. So, I start to think, 'Why not use a CLI to manage my Jenkins?'.\n\nWhy create a new one?\n\nFirst, I almost forgot about the existing Jenkins CLI, written in Java. Let me introduce how to use that one.\n\nVisit Jenkins page from http://localhost:8080/jenkins/cli/ . You’ll see a command like java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/jenkins/ help. So, a jar file needs to be download.\nWe can use this command to complete this task wget http://localhost:8080/jenkins/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar .\n\nNow you can see that this is not a Linux-style CLI. Please consider some points below:\n\nThe users must have a JRE. This is not convenient for developers who don’t use Java.\n\nThe CLI is too wordy. We always need to type java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/jenkins/ as the initial command.\n\nCannot install it by some popular package manager, like brew or yum.\n\nOf course, the Java CLI client is more native with Jenkins. But I’d like to use this more easily.\nSo I decided to create a new CLI tool which would be written in Go and which would natively run on modern platforms.\n\nThat’s the story of creating jcli.\n\nFeatures\n\nEasy to maintain config file for jcli\n\nMultiple Jenkins support\n\nPlugins management (list, search, install, upload)\n\nJob management (search, build, log)\n\nOpen your Jenkins with a browser\n\nRestart your Jenkins\n\nConnection with proxy support\n\nHow to get it?\n\nYou can clone jcli from the jenkins-cli repo. For now, we support\nthese three most popular OS platforms: MacOS, Linux, and Windows.\n\nMacOS\n\nYou can use brew to install jcli.\n\nbrew tap jenkins-zh/jcli\nbrew install jcli\n\nLinux\n\nIt’s very simple to install jcli into your Linux OS. Just need to execute a command line at below:\n\ncurl -L https://github.com/jenkins-zh/jenkins-cli/releases/latest/download/jcli-linux-amd64.tar.gz|tar xzv\nsudo mv jcli /usr/local/bin/\n\nWindows\n\nYou can find the latest version by clicking here. Then download the tar file, cp the uncompressed jcli directory into your system path.\n\nHow to get started?\n\nIt’s very simple to use this. Once you get jcli on your computer, use this command to generate a sample configuration:\n\n$ jcli config generate\ncurrent: yourServer\njenkins_servers:\n- name: yourServer\n  url: http://localhost:8080/jenkins\n  username: admin\n  token: 111e3a2f0231198855dceaff96f20540a9\n  proxy: \"\"\n  proxyAuth: \"\"\n# Goto 'http://localhost:8080/jenkins/me/configure', then you can generate your token.\n\nIn most cases, you should modify three fields which are url, username and token. OK, I believe you’re ready. Please check whether you install the github plugin in your Jenkins:\n\njcli plugin list --filter name=github\n\nThat’s the end. It’s still in very early development stage. Any contribution is welcome.","title":"Managing Jenkins with jcli","tags":["general","jcli","cli","tools"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#989898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/77b35/linuxsuren.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/d4a57/linuxsuren.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/68974/linuxsuren.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/ef6ff/linuxsuren.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/8257c/linuxsuren.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/6766a/linuxsuren.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/22bfc/linuxsuren.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"LinuxSuRen","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Rick is a big fan of Jenkins, also as a contributor leading the Jenkins China community.</p>\n</div>","id":"linuxsuren","irc":null,"linkedin":"linuxsuren","name":"赵晓杰(Rick)","slug":"/blog/authors/linuxsuren","twitter":"LinuxSuRen"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ec0ca077-b2d0-53a4-8b1d-2ecb784b35fd","slug":"/blog/2019/08/26/role-strategy-performance/","strippedHtml":"The task for my Google Summer of Code program was to improve the performance\nof the Role Strategy Plugin. The performance issues for Role Strategy Plugin\nhad been reported multiple times on Jenkins JIRA. With a large number of roles\nand with complex regular expressions, a large slow-down was visible on the Web UI.\nEven before GSoC started, there were a number of patches which tried to improve\nperformance of the plugin (by Deepansh Nagaria\nand others).\n\nAt the time, there was no way to reliably measure improvements in performance.\nTherefore, we started by creating a\nframework\nfor running micro-benchmarks on Jenkins Plugins. Benchmarks using the framework\nwere added to the Role Strategy Plugin find performance\ncritical parts of the plugins and to measure the improvements of a change.\nThis blog post summarizes the changes that were made and performance improvements\nmeasured.\n\nCaching matching roles\n\nA couple of major changes were made to the Role Strategy Plugin to improve its\nperformance. First, we started collection of roles that matched a given\nproject name. The Role Strategy plugin before version 2.12 used to run over\nregular expressions for every role that it had for every permission checking\nrequest it got. Storing this produced set of roles in the memory provides us\nlarge improvements in performance and avoids repeated matching of project names\nwith regular expressions. For keeping the plugin working securely, we invalidate\nthe cache whenever any update is made to the roles.\n\nAfter this change, we were able to observe performance improvements of up to\n3300%. These improvements were visualized using\nJMH Visualizer.\n\nMore information is available at pull request on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/pull/81\n\nCalculating Implying Permisions when plugin is loaded\n\nJenkins' permission model allows one permissions to imply other permissions.\nWhen a permission check is made, we need to check if the user has any of\npermissions that would imply this permisison. For every permission checking\nrequest that that the Role Strategy, it used to calculate all the implying\npermissions. To avoid this, we now calculate and store implying permissions\nfor every permission in the Jenkins system when the plugin gets loaded.\n\nAfter both of these changes, we were able to experience improvements of up to\n10000%. The benchmark results show it better:\n\nMore information about this change can be found at the GitHub pull request:\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/pull/83\n\nBoth of these changes were integrated into the Role Strategy Plugin and the\nimprovements can be experienced starting with version\n2.13.\n\nBonus: Configuration-as-Code export now works for Role Strategy\n\nWith Configuration-as-Code plugin version\n1.24\nand above, export of your configuration as YAML now works!\n\nAs an alternative to\nRole Strategy Plugin, I also created the brand new Folder Authorization Plugin.\nYou can check out the blog post for\nmore information about the plugin.\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nI would love to hear your comments and suggestions. Please feel free to reach\nout to me through either the\nRole Strategy Plugin Gitter chat or through\nJenkins Developer Mailing list.\n\nPresentation slides for final evaluation of GSoC\n\nThe Folder Authorization Plugin\n\nDemo for the final evaluations","title":"Performance Improvements to Role Strategy Plugin","tags":["plugins","security","performance","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/ff5b9/abhyudayasharma.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/f4523/abhyudayasharma.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/1e7bb/abhyudayasharma.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/ff5b9/abhyudayasharma.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/b48b6/abhyudayasharma.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/1fd06/abhyudayasharma.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/9edd6/abhyudayasharma.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/f5f75/abhyudayasharma.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/05d06/abhyudayasharma.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":142}}},"blog":null,"github":"AbhyudayaSharma","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Abhyudaya is a Computer Science student at Shiv Nadar University, India.\nHe is participating in Google Summer of Code 2019 to improve the performance\nof the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin\">Role Strategy Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"abhyudayasharma","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Abhyudaya Sharma","slug":"/blog/authors/abhyudayasharma","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d12bee04-3e3b-5a23-9775-d800d9abf794","slug":"/blog/2019/08/25/jenkinsworld-contrib-summit-ask-the-expert-booth/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins turns 15 years old!\nJenkins World brings together DevOps thought leaders, IT executives, continuous delivery practitioners and the Jenkins\ncommunity and ecosystem in one global event, providing attendees with the opportunity to learn, explore, network\nface-to-face and help shape the next evolution of Jenkins development and solutions for DevOps.\n\nThere is also the Jenkins Contributor Summit in San Francisco.

This was a chance for everyone to get together and talk about\ncontributions and put faces to names. Most people I had only met via video chat or on gitter so I was super excited.\nWe gathered to hear about the start of the Jenkins open source landscape.\n\nNext up was the BoF/Unconference. I was leading these sessions and I felt they went really well.\nWe had fellow org admins Martin d’Anjou and Jeff Pearce give a talk about Google Summer of Code projects.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code student Natasha Stopa presented her project, Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool. This is\na super cool project and very well received in the community.\n\nWe closed out the session with a presentation from Steven Terrana from Booz Allen Hamilton and the awesome Jenkins\nTemplating Engine.

There is a lot of marketing data regarding the increased usage of\nKubernetes but I was seriously surprised by the massive interest in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nOf course there were opportunities for selfie requests.\n\nLunch time demos got underway and we had a busy schedule.\nFirst up was the awesome Mark Waite to talk about the\nGit plugin. A lot of people use git in\nJenkins.\nThank you so much for all that you do Mark.\n\nJenkins org admin Martin d’Anjou was next on deck to talk about the Google Summer of Code. So amazing to think that the\nGoogle Summer of Code is also in its 15th year like Jenkins!\n\nNatasha Stopa is a Google Summer of Code student and she presented her project Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool.\nNatasha really put a lot of hard work in to this plugin and it was really awesome to see the turn out and support during\nher presentation.\n\nFinally there was me. I presented the Sysdig Secure Scanning Jenkins plugin which I am a maintainer of. I thank everyone who attended\n\nRight after the lunch time demos I also oversaw the Jenkins open space. This was an opportunity for the community to talk\nabout items and let them flow organically. I really enjoyed this session and felt it was also well received.\n\nWe closed out the day and the event with a picture of some of the Jenkins org admins and Google Summer of Code students.\nMissing from this photos are fellow org admins, Lloyd Chang and Oleg Nenashev\n\nClosing\n\nThis was an amazing experience.

The Working Hours Plugin repository can be found at Working Hours Plugin.\n\nOverview\n\nDeveloping plugin for Jenkins has always been easy to do with its Jelly based UI render system, but Jelly seems to be pretty heavy when we want to use more modernized frameworks like React, or if we need to make the plugin UI more customized. This is what this template is built for.\n\nAnd with React integrated, development of Jenkins plugin is more modernized, developer can now use tons of React libraries, the way to use libraries is now tinier and safer with webpack, in short, coding with Jenkins plugin can be much easier.\n\nFeatures\n\nFeature\nSummary\n\nReact Integrated\nReact is integrated, you can take full control of the UI\n\nUsing Iframe\nUsing iframe can create a new javascript env, we can get rid of some side effects of some polyfills which was added globally.(such as Prototype.js)\n\nMaven Lifecycle\nnpm commands are integrated into Maven lifecycle with help of Frontend Maven Plugin\n\nWebpack\nWebpack helps us reduce the size of the bundle, also avoids pollution on the global namespace.\n\nJenkins Crumb attached\nCrumb is attached to Axios client, now you can send requests in the way you used to do in React.\n\nExpress as devserver\nYou can run your react app in a standalone page so you can develop in webpack hot reload mode, also with webpack proxy, the standalone app is still accessible to the jenkins dev server.\n\nAxios as http client\nAxios hugely simplify the way to make requests.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExample Plugin UI\n\nManagement Link\n\nGetting Started\n\nClone the repo:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/react-plugin-template.git\ncd react-plugin-template\n\nInstall the Maven dependencies and node modules.\n\nmvn install -DskipTests\n\nRun standalone React app with hot reload\n\nnpm run start\n\nRun plugin\n\nmvn hpi:run -Dskip.npm -f pom.xml\n\nSend HTTP requests\n\nAs Crumb Issuer is default enabled in Jenkins and each ajax request is required to contain a Jenkins Crumb in request header, so be sure to use the axiosInstance which is already set up with Jenkins Crumb and exported at src/main/react/app/api.js.\n\nexport const apiGetData = () => {\n  return axiosInstance.post(\"/data\");\n};\n\nOr if you want to use your own http client, remember to add the Jenkins Crumb to your request’s header, the Crumb’s key and content could be found at src/main/react/app/utils/urlConfig.js, then you can set the header like below.\n\nconst headers = {};\nconst crumbHeaderName = UrlConfig.getCrumbHeaderName();\n\nif (crumbHeaderName) {\n  headers[crumbHeaderName] = UrlConfig.getCrumbToken();\n}\n\nWrite your own request handler\n\nNow you can customize your request pattern as you want, also we need to write a handler.\n\nJenkins is using stapler to preprocess the requests, so if you need a request handler. For example and also in this template, you can use an Action class to create a sub-url, and then a StaplerProxy to proxy the request like a router. More info about handlers can be found in the Stapler Reference.\n\nExample handler\n\nManagementLink would get the request and then hand it off to the PluginUI\n\n@Extension\npublic class PluginManagementLink extends ManagementLink implements StaplerProxy {\n\n    PluginUI webapp;\n\n    public Object getTarget() {\n        return webapp;\n    }\n\n    public String getUrlName() {\n        return \"react-plugin-template\";\n    }\n}\n\nPluginUI, stapler would then find methods in the target class, in this case, it finds doDynamic, then we can choose the next handler by return the methods result, in this case, getTodos or setTodos, and PluginUI just function like a url router.\n\npublic class PluginUI{\n    public HttpResponse doDynamic(StaplerRequest request) {\n        ...\n\n        List params = getRequestParams(request);\n\n        switch (params.get(0)) {\n        case \"get-todos\":\n            return getTodos();\n        case \"set-todos\":\n            return setTodos(request);\n        }\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nData Persistence\n\nYou can save your data with a descriptor\n\n@Extension\npublic class PluginConfig extends Descriptor implements Describable\n\nAnd after each time you change data, call save() to persist them.\n\npublic void setTodos(\n            @CheckForNull List value) {\n        this.todos = value;\n        save();\n    }\n\nAnd in your handler, you can get the config class by calling\n\nconfig = ExtensionList.lookup(PluginConfig.class).get(0);\n\nCustomize your plugin\n\nBe sure to modify all the occurrence of react-template\n\nAt org/jenkinsci/plugins/reactplugintemplate/PluginUI/index.jelly, change the iframe’s id and its source url.\n\nAt src/main/react/app/utils/urlConfig.js change\n\nAt src/main/react/server/config.js, change the proxy route.\n\nAt src/main/react/package.json, change the start script’s BASE_URL\n\nAt pom.xml, change the artifactId\n\nAt org/jenkinsci/plugins/reactplugintemplate/PluginManagementLink.java, change names.\n\nAlso use the same value to modify the occurrence in src\\main\\react\\app\\utils\\urlConfig.js.\n\nCustomize a page for your plugin\n\nA management Link is recommended, which would get your plugin a standalone page, along with a entry button in the /manage system manage page.\n\nHow does this template work?\n\nThis template is putting a webpack project inside a Maven project, and this template is just chaining the build result by copy the webpack output to the plugin’s webapp folder to make it accessible from the iframe, then Jelly render the iframe and the client gets the Plugin UI.\n\nWhy iframe?\n\nOver time, Jenkins has added a lot of various javascript libraries to every regular page, which now causes problems for using modern Javascript tooling and as such, we decided to inline the new react based pages in their own sandbox which prevents collisions with other libraries, and maybe the iframe is a good sandbox case.\n\nLinks\n\nGithub: React Plugin Template\n\nGithub: Working Hours Plugin","title":"Introduce React Plugin Template","tags":["react","plugins","template","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/77b35/jackshen.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/d4a57/jackshen.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/14734/jackshen.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ef6ff/jackshen.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/8257c/jackshen.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/f4bd7/jackshen.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/65cd2/jackshen.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":129}}},"blog":null,"github":"ShenJack","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Shen is a student from Beijing Forestry University.

It allows you to create job based on GitLab user or group or subgroup project(s). You can either:\n\nImport a single project’s branches as jobs from a GitLab user/group/subgroup (Multibranch Pipeline Job)\n\nImport all or a subset of projects as jobs from a GitLab user/group/subgroup (GitLab Group Job or GitLab Folder Organization)\n\nThe GitLab Group project scans the projects, importing the pipeline jobs it identifies based on the criteria provided. After a project is imported, Jenkins immediately runs the jobs based on the Jenkinsfile pipeline script and notifies the status to GitLab Pipeline Status. This plugin unlike other Branch Source Plugins provides GitLab server configuration which can be configured in Configure System. Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) can also be used to configure the server. To learn more about server configuration see my previous blog post.\n\nRequirements\n\nJenkins - 2.176.2 (LTS)\n\nGitLab - v11.0+\n\nCreating a Job\n\nTo create a Multibranch Pipeline Job (with GitLab branch source) or GitLab Group Job, you must have GitLab Personal Access Token added to the server configuration. The credentials is used to fetch meta data of the project(s) and to set up hooks on GitLab Server. If the token has admin access you can also set up System Hooks while Web Hooks can be set up from any user token.\n\nCreate a Multibranch Pipeline Job\n\nGo to Jenkins > New Item > Multibranch Pipeline > Add Source > GitLab Project\n\nServer - Select your desired GitLab server from the dropdown, needs to be configured before creating this job.\n\nCheckout Credentials - Add credentials of type SSHPrivateKey or Username/Password if there are any private projects to be built by the plugin. If all projects are public then no checkout credentials required. Checkout credential is different from the credential (of type GitLab Personal Access Token) setup in GitLab server config.\n\nOwner - Can be a user, group or subgroup. Depending on this the Projects field is populated.\n\nProjects - Select the project you want to build from the dropdown.\n\nBehaviours - These traits are very powerful tool to configure the build logic and post build logic. We have defined new traits. You can see all the information in repository documentation.\n\nSave and wait for the branches indexing. You are free to navigate from here, the job progress is displayed to the left hand side.\n\nAfter the indexing, the imported project listed all the branches, merge requests and tags as jobs.\n\nOn visiting each job, you will find some action items on the left hand side:\n\nYou can trigger the job manually by selecting Build Now.\n\nYou can visiting the particular branch/merge request/tag on your GitLab Server by selecting the corresponding button.\n\nCreate a GitLab Group Job Type\n\nGo to Jenkins > New Item > GitLab Group\n\nYou can notice the configuration is very similar to Multibranch Pipeline Job with only Projects field missing. You can add all the projects inside your Owner i.e. User/Group/Subgroup. The form validation will check with your GitLab server if the owner is valid. You can add Discover subgroup project trait which allows you to discover this child projects of all subgroups inside a Group or Subgroup but this trait is not applicable to User. While indexing, web hook is created in each project. GitLab Api doesn’t support creation of Group web hooks so this plugin doesn’t support that feature which is only available in GitLab EE.\n\nYou can now explore your imported projects, configuring different settings on each of those folders if needed.\n\nGitLab Pipeline Status Notification\n\nGitLab is notified about build status from the point of queuing of jobs.\n\nSuccess - the job was successful\n\nFailure - the job failed and the merge request is not ready to be merged\n\nError - something unexpected happened; example: the job was aborted in Jenkins\n\nPending - the job is waiting in the build queue\n\nOn GitLab Pipeline status are hyperlinks to the corresponding Jenkins job build. To see the Pipeline Stages and the console output you will be required to visit your Jenkins server. We also planned to notify the pipeline stages to GitLab but it came with some drawbacks which has been addressed so far but there is future plan to add it as trait.\n\nYou can also skip notifying GitLab about the pipeline status by selecting Skip pipeline status notifications from the traits list.\n\nMerge Requests\n\nImplementing support for Merge Requests for the projects was challenging. First, MRs are of 2 types i.e. Origin branches and Forked Project branches so there had to be different implementation for each head. Second, MRs from forks can be from untrusted sources, so a new strategy Trust Members was implemented which allows CI to build MRs only from trusted users who have accesslevel of Developer / Maintainer / Owner.\n\nThird, MRs from forks do not support pipeline status notification due to GitLab issue, see this. You can add a trait Log Build Status as Comment on GitLab that allows you to add a sudo user (leave empty if you want owner user) to comment on the commit/tag/mrs the build result. To add a sudo user your token must have admin access. By default only failure/error are logged as comment but you can also enable logging of success build by ticking the checkbox.\n\nSometimes, Merge Requests fail due to external errors so you want to trigger rebuild of mr by commenting jenkins rebuild. To enable this trigger add the trait Trigger build on merge request comment. The comment body can be changed in the trait. For security reasons, commentor should have Developer / Maintainer / Owner accesslevel in the project.\n\nHooks\n\nWeb hooks are automatically created on your projects if configured to do so in server configuration. Web hooks are ensured to pass through a CSRF filter. Jenkins listens to web hooks on the path /gitlab-webhook/post. On GitLab web hooks are triggered on the following events:\n\nPush Event - when a commit or branch is pushed\n\nTag Event - when a new tag is created\n\nMerge Request Event - when a merge request is created/updated\n\nNote Event - when a comment is made on a merge request\n\nYou can also set up System Hooks on your GitLab server if your token has admin access. System hooks are triggered when new projects are created, Jenkins triggers a rescan of the new project based on the configuration and sets up web hook on it. Jenkins listens to system hooks on the path /gitlab-systemhook/post. On GitLab system hooks are triigered on Repository Update Events.\n\nYou can also use Override Hook Management mode trait to override the default hook management and choose if you want to use a different context (say Item) or disable it altogether.\n\nJob DSL and JCasC\n\nYou can use Job DSL to create jobs. Here’s an example of Job DSL script:\n\norganizationFolder('GitLab Organization Folder') {\n    description(\"GitLab org folder created with Job DSL\")\n    displayName('My Project')\n    // \"Projects\"\n    organizations {\n        gitLabSCMNavigator {\n            projectOwner(\"baymac\")\n            credentialsId(\"i<3GitLab\")\n            serverName(\"gitlab-3214\")\n            // \"Traits\" (\"Behaviours\" in the GUI) that are \"declarative-compatible\"\n            traits {\n                subGroupProjectDiscoveryTrait() // discover projects inside subgroups\n                gitLabBranchDiscovery {\n                    strategyId(3) // discover all branches\n                }\n                originMergeRequestDiscoveryTrait {\n                    strategyId(1) // discover MRs and merge them with target branch\n                }\n                gitLabTagDiscovery() // discover tags\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // \"Traits\" (\"Behaviours\" in the GUI) that are NOT \"declarative-compatible\"\n    // For some 'traits, we need to configure this stuff by hand until JobDSL handles it\n    // https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-45504\n    configure {\n        def traits = it / navigators / 'io.jenkins.plugins.gitlabbranchsource.GitLabSCMNavigator' / traits\n        traits\n\nYou can also use JCasC to directly create job from a Job DSL script. For example see the plugin repository.\n\nHow to talk to us about bugs or new features?\n\nThis project uses Jenkins JIRA to track issues. You can file issues under gitlab-branch-source-plugin component.\n\nSend your mail in the Developer Mailing list.\n\nJoin our Gitter channel.\n\nFuture work\n\nActively maintain GitLab Branch Source Plugin and take feedbacks from users to improve the plugin’s user experience.\n\nExtend support for GitLab Pipeline to Blueocean.\n\nResources\n\nGitLab API Plugin\n\nGitLab API Plugin Wiki\n\nGitLab Branch Source Plugin\n\nProject Summary\n\nGitHub Branch Source Plugin Release\n\nThank you Jenkins and Google Summer of Code :)","title":"Introducing new GitLab Branch Source Plugin","tags":["gitlab","plugins","pipeline","multibranch","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/20305/baymac.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/eb017/baymac.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/ed0e7/baymac.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/20305/baymac.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/b3c75/baymac.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/bcdad/baymac.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/21187/baymac.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/33025/baymac.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/d386c/baymac.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":192}}},"blog":null,"github":"baymac","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2019 student under Jenkins project.

It was\nan amazing experience getting to meet people from all over world who are trying\nto make the development and release process easier and more efficient. I enjoyed\nlearning more about industry tools, processes, and standards, and meeting CI/CD\nexperts and contributors in the open source community.\n\nBelow is a summary of my experience. Thank you to the Jenkins project and CloudBees for making\n my trip and attendance possible!\n\nDay 1\n\nMonday was the Continuous Delivery Contributor Summit, which focused on projects\nunder the CDF umbrella.  After checking in and grabbing my badge, I was able to\nmeet up with some of the Google Summer of Code org admins. It was great\nbeing able to actually meet them in person after talking to them over video\nconferencing and chats all summer!\n\nTracy Miranda started the summit out by introducing the Continuous Delivery Foundation,\nwhich aims to provide a vendor neutral home to help and sustain open source projects\nfocusing on all aspects of continuous delivery.  Currently, Jenkins, Tekton, Spinnaker,\nand JenkinsX have joined the foundation.  Project updates were given for Jenkins,\nTekton, and JenkinsX.  In the afternoon, attendees split into different groups for\nunconference sessions.  I presented my project to the Jenkins group.  Afterwards,\nthere was free time to chat with other attendees about my project and the other Jenkins\nprojects. Lastly, lightning talks were given before everyone headed to the contributor\nappreciation event to grab some food and drinks.\n\nDay 2\n\nI attended the Jenkins Pipeline Fundamentals Short Course in the morning. Even\nthough I’m working on a project for Jenkins, there’s still a lot I don’t know so\nI just wanted to try to learn more.\n\nA lot of the afternoon sessions filled up, so I spent the afternoon trying to meet\nother people at the conference, before heading to the keynote. The keynote\ntalked more about the CDF and some of the backstory behind its origin.  This year is also a big anniversary for Jenkins - it has now been\naround for 15 years.\n\nAfter the keynote, I checked out a Women in Tech mixer and\nthe opening of the exibition hall. Probably my favorite swag I picked up was the\n\"Will Code for Beer\" stickers and a bottle of hot sauce.\n\nDay 3\n\nThe morning began with another keynote. Shawn Ahmed of CloudBees talked about the\nchallenges of visibility into bottlenecks of the development process and Rajeev Mahajan\ndiscussed how HSBC tackled DevOps.  The rest of the day I attended different sessions\non container tooling, implementing CI/CD in a cloud native environment, running\nJenkins on Jenkins, and database DevOps.\n\nAfter the sessions finished, I wandered\naround the expo until it closed, then joined some of the other conference attendees\nto have some fun at a ping pong bar nearby.\n\nDay 4\n\nThe final and last day of the conference was probably my favorite.  The morning\nkeynote revealed that Zhao Xiaojie had won an award for his work on Jenkins advocacy,\nsome other DevOps award panelists talked about their approaches to different challenges,\nthen David Stanke gave an enjoyable presentation about cloud native CI/CD. I was\nable to present my summer project and attend a few more sessions, including one\nabout DevOps at scale, and another about use cases for machine learning in CI/CD pipelines.\n\nThe last keynote given by James Governor was a thoughtful look into the current and\nfuture states of tech. How does tech look like it will scale in the coming years\nin the U.S. and across the world? How can we make tech more inclusive and accessible?\nWhat can we do to minimize our environmental footprint?  In particular, his points\non welcoming people from a non-traditional computer science background resonated with\nme since I’m currently undergoing my own career transition to tech.\n\nAfter the conference ended, I said goodbye to the remaining GSoC org admins before\nmeeting an old friend for dinner and bringing along some new friends I met at the\nconference.  I spent the remaining part of the night singing karaoke with\nthem before heading out of San Francisco the next morning.\n\nThanks again to everyone who supported me and encouraged me leading up to and during\nmy presentation, patiently answered my questions as I tried to gather more context\nabout CI/CD tools and practices, and made my first DevOps conference so enjoyable!","title":"My DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 Experience","tags":["pluginmanagement","devopsworld2019","gsoc","gsoc2019","community","events"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#280818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/405b9/stopalopa.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7b6be/stopalopa.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/ebcfb/stopalopa.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/0ade5/stopalopa.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/5b0b1/stopalopa.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/96834/stopalopa.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/805f6/stopalopa.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":184}}},"blog":null,"github":"stopalopa","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Natasha is a Master&#8217;s student at Penn State University.

My project for Google Summer of Code 2019 is Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features. After a successful Phase 1, finally the 2.0 version of the plugin has been released. The 2.0 version provides seamless integration with Kubernetes environment.\n\n2.0 version features\n\nStart a simple Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes.\n\nDynamically provision Remoting Kafka Agent in Kubernetes.\n\nHelm chart to bootstrap the whole system in Kubernetes.\n\nStart a simple Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes\n\nUse of the plugin requires that users have a configured Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka server, which could be intimidating for people who just want to try out the plugin. Now, users can start a simple, single-node Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes environment with just one button click.\n\nOn the Global Configuration page, users can input Kubernetes server information and credentials. When users click Start Kafka on Kubernetes button, Jenkins will create a Kubernetes client from the information and then apply Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka YAML specification files from resources. After downloading images and creating containers, it will automatically update Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka URLs into respective fields.\n\nDynamically provision Remoting Kafka Agent in Kubernetes\n\nWith previous version, users have to manually add/remove nodes so it is hard to scale builds quickly. Kubernetes plugin allows us to dynamically provision agents in Kubernetes but it is designed for JNLP agent. With this new version, Remoting Kafka agent can also be provisioned automatically in Kubernetes environment.\n\nUsers can find the new feature in Cloud section in /configure. Here users could input Kubernetes connection parameters and desired Remoting Kafka agent properties including labels. When new build with matching labels gets started and there are no free nodes, Cloud will automatically provision Remoting Kafka agent pod in Kubernetes to run the build.\n\nHelm Chart\n\nHelm chart for Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin is based on stable/jenkins chart and incubator/kafka chart. You can follow the instruction here to install a demo ready-to-use Helm release. Your kubectl get all should look like this:\n\nNAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/demo-jenkins-64dbd87987-bmndf   1/1     Running   0          2m21s\npod/demo-kafka-0                    1/1     Running   0          2m21s\npod/demo-zookeeper-0                1/1     Running   0          2m21s\n\nNAME                              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE\nservice/demo-jenkins              NodePort    10.108.238.56 8080:30386/TCP               2m21s\nservice/demo-jenkins-agent        ClusterIP   10.98.85.184 50000/TCP                    2m21s\nservice/demo-kafka                ClusterIP   10.109.231.58 9092/TCP                     2m21s\nservice/demo-kafka-headless       ClusterIP   None 9092/TCP                     2m21s\nservice/demo-zookeeper            ClusterIP   10.103.2.231 2181/TCP                     2m21s\nservice/demo-zookeeper-headless   ClusterIP   None 2181/TCP,3888/TCP,2888/TCP   2m21s\n\nNAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/demo-jenkins   1/1     1            1           2m21s\n\nNAME                                      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\nreplicaset.apps/demo-jenkins-64dbd87987   1         1         1       2m21s\n\nNAME                              READY   AGE\nstatefulset.apps/demo-kafka       1/1     2m21s\nstatefulset.apps/demo-zookeeper   1/1     2m21s\n\nHow to Contribute\n\nYou are welcome to try out the plugin and integrate it into your current setup.
