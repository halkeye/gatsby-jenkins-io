of Code is much more than a summer internship program, it is a year-round effort for the organization and some community members.\nNow, after the DevOps World | Jenkins World conference in Lisbon and final retrospective meetings, we can say that GSoC 2019 is officially over.\nWe would like to start by thanking all participants: students, mentors, subject matter experts and all other contributors who proposed project ideas, participated in student selection, in community bonding and in further discussions and reviews.\nGoogle Summer of Code is a major effort which would not be possible without the active participation of the Jenkins community.\n\nIn this blogpost we would like to share the results and our experience from the previous year.\n\nResults\n\nFive GSoC projects were successfully completed this year:\nRole Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements,\nPlugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library,\nWorking Hours Plugin - UI Improvements,\nRemoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features,\nMulti-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM.\nWe will talk about the projects a little later in the document.\n\nProject details\n\nWe held the final presentations as Jenkins Online Meetups in late August and Google published the results on Sept 3rd.\nThe final presentations can be found here:\nPart 1,\nPart 2,\nPart 3.\nWe also presented the\n2019 Jenkins GSoC report\nat the DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco\nand at the\nDevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Lisbon conferences.\n\nIn the following sections, we present a brief summary of each project, links to the coding phase 3 presentations, and to the final products.\n\nRole Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements\n\nRole Strategy Plugin is one of the most widely used authorization plugins for Jenkins,\nbut it has never been famous for performance due to architecture issues and regular expression checks for project roles.\nAbhyudaya Sharma was working on this project together with hist mentors:\nOleg Nenashev, Runze Xia and Supun Wanniarachchi.\nHe started the project from creating a new Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins based on JMH,\ncreated benchmarks and achieved a 3501% improvement on some real-world scenarios.\nThen he went further and created a new Folder-based Authorization Strategy Plugin which offers even better performance for Jenkins instances where permissions are scoped to folders.\nDuring his project Abhyudaya also fixed the Jenkins Configuration-as-Code support in Role Strategy and contributed several improvements and fixes to the JCasC Plugin itself.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins,\nIntroducing new Folder Authorization Plugin, Performance Improvements to Role Strategy Plugin\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nSource code: Role Strategy Plugin, Folder Authorization Plugin\n\nPlugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library\n\nNatasha Stopa was working on a new CLI tool for plugin management,\nwhich should unify features available in other tools like install-plugins.sh in Docker images.\nIt also introduced many new features like YAML configuration format support, listing of available updates and security fixes.\nThe newly created tool should eventually replace the previous ones.\nNatasha’s mentors: Kristin Whetstone, Jon Brohauge and Arnab Banerjee.\nAlso, many contributors from Platform SIG and JCasC plugin team joined the project as a key stakeholders and subject-matter experts.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: alpha release announcement,\ncoding phase 2 updates\n\nFinal evaluation: slides,\nvideo\n\nSource code: Plugin installation manager tool\n\nWorking Hours Plugin - UI Improvements\n\nJenkins UI and frontend framework are a common topic in the Jenkins project,\nespecially in recent months after the new UX SIG was established.\nJack Shen was working on exploring new ways to build Jenkins Web UI together with his mentor Jeff Pearce.\nJack updated the Working Hours Plugin to use UI controls provided by standard React libraries.\nThen he documented his experienced and created template for plugins with React-based UI.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: Updates on Working Hours Plugin UI,\nReact Plugin Template\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nSource code: Working Hours Plugin, Template for Jenkins plugins with React-based UI\n\nRemoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features\n\nLong Le Vu Nguyen was working on extended Kubernetes support in the Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin.\nHis mentors were Andrey Falco and Pham vu Tuan who was our GSoC 2018 student and the plugin creator.\nDuring this project Long has added a new agent launcher which provisions Jenkins agents in Kubernetes and connects them to the controller.\nHe also created a Cloud API implementation for it and a new Helm chart which can provision Jenkins as entire system in Kubernetes,\nwith Apache Kafka enabled by default.\nAll these features were released in Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog post for [Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nPlugin source code\n\nMulti-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM\n\nParichay Barpanda was working on the new GitLab Branch Source Plugin with Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs and Folder Organisation support.\nHis mentors were\nMarky Jackson-Taulia,\nJustin Harringa,\nZhao Xiaojie and\nJoseph Petersen.\nThe plugin scans the projects, importing the pipeline jobs it identifies based on the criteria provided.\nAfter a project is imported, Jenkins immediately runs the jobs based on the Jenkinsfile pipeline script and notifies the status to GitLab Pipeline Status.\nThis plugin also provides GitLab server configuration which can be configured in Configure System or via Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC).\nread more about this project in the GitLab Branch Source 1.0 announcement.\n\nProject page\n\nCoding phase 3 presentation\n\nGitlab Branch Source Plugin, Gitlab API plugin\n\nProjects which were not completed\n\nNot all projects have been completed this year.\nWe were also working on Artifact Promotion plugin for Jenkins Pipeline\nand on Cloud Features for External Workspace Manager Plugin,\nbut unfortunately both projects were stopped after coding phase 1.\nAnyway, we got a lot of experience and takeaways in these areas (see linked Jira tickets!.\nWe hope that these stories will be implemented by Jenkins contributors at some point.\nGoogle Summer of Code 2020 maybe?\n\nRunning the GSoC program at our organization level\n\nHere are some of the things our organization did before and during GSoC behind the scenes.\nTo prepare for the influx of students, we updated all our GSoC pages and wrote down all the knowledge we accumulated over the years of running the program.\nWe started preparing in October 2018, long before the official start of the program.\nThe main objective was to address the feedback we got during GSoC 2018 retrospectives.\n\nProject ideas.\nWe started gathering project ideas in the last months of 2018.\nWe prepared a list of project ideas in a Google doc, and we tracked ownership of each project in a table of that document.\nEach project idea was further elaborated in its own Google doc.\nWe find that when projects get complicated during the definition phase, perhaps they are really too complicated and should not be done.\n\nSince we wanted all the project ideas to be documented the same way, we created a template to guide the contributors.\nMost of the project idea documents were written by org admins or mentors, but occasionally a student proposed a genuine idea.\nWe also captured contact information in that document such as GitHub and Gitter handles, and a preliminary list of potential mentors for the project.\nWe embedded all the project documents on our website.\n\nMentor and student guidelines.\nWe updated the mentor information page with details on what we expect mentors to do during the program,\nincluding the number of hours that are expected from mentors,\nand we even have a section on preventing conflict of interest.\nWhen we recruit mentors, we point them to the mentor information page.\n\nWe also updated the student information page.\nWe find this is a huge time saver as every student contacting us has the same questions about joining and participating in the program.\nInstead of re-explaining the program each time, we send them a link to those pages.\n\nApplication phase.\nStudents started to reach out very early on as well, many weeks before GSoC officially started.\nThis was very motivating.\nSome students even started to work on project ideas before the official start of the program.\n\nProject selection. This year the org admin team had some very difficult decisions to make.\nWith lots of students, lots of projects and lots of mentors, we had to request the right number of slots and try to match the projects with the most chances of success.\nWe were trying to form mentor teams at the same time as we were requesting the number of slots, and it was hard to get responses from all mentors in time for the deadline.\nFinally we requested fewer slots than we could have filled.\nWhen we request slots, we submit two numbers: a minimum and a maximum. The GSoC guide states that:\n\nThe minimum is based on the projects that are so amazing they really want to see these projects occur over the summer,\n\nand the maximum number should be the number of solid and amazing projects they wish to mentor over the summer.\n\nWe were awarded minimum. So we had to make very hard decisions: we had to decide between \"amazing\" and \"solid\" proposals.\nFor some proposals, the very outstanding ones, it’s easy.\nBut for the others, it’s hard.\nWe know we cannot make the perfect decision, and by experience, we know that some students or some mentors will not be able to complete the program due to uncontrollable life events, even for the outstanding proposals.\nSo we have to make the best decision knowing that some of our choices won’t complete the program.\n\nCommunity Bonding.\nWe have found that the community bonding phase was crucial to the success of each project.\nUsually projects that don’t do well during community bonding have difficulties later on.\nIn order to get students involved in the community better, almost all projects were handled under the umbrella of Special Interest Groups so that there were more stakeholders and communications.\n\nCommunications.\nEvery year we have students who contact mentors via personal messages.\nStudents, if you are reading this, please do NOT send us personal messages about the projects, you will not receive any preferential treatment.\nObviously, in open source we want all discussions to be public, so students have to be reminded of that regularly.\nIn 2019 we are using Gitter chat for most communications, but from an admin point of view this is more fragmented than mailing lists.\nIt is also harder to search.\nChat rooms are very convenient because they are focused, but from an admin point of view, the lack of threads in Gitter makes it hard to get an overview.\nGitter threads were added recently (Nov 2019) but do not yet work well on Android and iOS.\nWe adopted Zoom Meetings towards the end of the program and we are finding it easier to work with than Google Hangouts.\n\nStatus tracking.\nAnother thing that was hard was to get an overview of how all the projects were doing once they were running.\nWe made extensive use of Google sheets to track lists of projects and participants during the program\nto rank projects and to track statuses of project phases (community bonding, coding, etc.).\nIt is a challenge to keep these sheets up to date, as each project involves several people and several links.\nWe have found it time consuming and a bit hard to keep these sheets up to date, accurate and complete, especially up until the start of the coding phase.\n\nPerhaps some kind of objective tracking tool would help.\nWe used Jenkins Jira for tracking projects, with each phase representing a separate sprint.\nIt helped a lot for successful projects.\nIn our organization, we try to get everyone to beat the deadlines by a couple of days, because we know that there might be events such as power outages,\nbad weather (happens even in Seattle!), or other uncontrolled interruptions, that might interfere with submitting project data.\nWe also know that when deadlines coincide with weekends, there is a risk that people may forget.\n\nRetrospective.\nAt the end of our project, we also held a retrospective and captured some ideas for the future.\nYou can find the notes here.\nWe already addressed the most important comments in our documentation and project ideas for the next year.\n\nRecognition\n\nLast year, we wanted to thank everyone who participated in the program by sending swag.\nThis year, we collected all the mailing addresses we could and sent to everyone we could the 15-year Jenkins special edition T-shirt, and some stickers.\nThis was a great feel good moment.\nI want to personally thank Alyssa Tong her help on setting aside the t-shirt and stickers.\n\nMentor summit\n\nEach year Google invites two or more mentors from each organization to the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit.\nAt this event, hundreds of open-source project maintainers and mentors meet together and have unconference sessions targeting GSoC, community management and various tools.\nThis year the summit was held in Munich,\nand we sent Marky Jackson and Oleg Nenashev as representatives there.\n\nApart from discussing projects and sharing chocolate, we also presented Jenkins there, conducted a lightning talk and hosted the unconference session about automation bots for GitHub.\nWe did not make a team photo there, so try to find Oleg and Marky on this photo:\n\nGSoC Team at DevOps World | Jenkins World\n\nWe traditionally use GSoC organization payments and travel grants to sponsor student trips to major Jenkins-related events.\nThis year four students traveled to the DevOps World | Jenkins World conferences in San-Francisco and Lisbon.\nStudents presented their projects at the community booth and at the contributor summits,\nand their presentations got a lot of traction in the community!\n\nThanks a lot to Google and CloudBees who made these trips possible.\nYou can find a travel report from Natasha Stopa here,\nmore travel reports are coming soon.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis year, five projects were successfully completed.\nWe find this to be normal and in line with what we hear from other participating organizations.\n\nTaking the time early to update our GSoC pages saved us a lot of time later because we did not have to repeat all the information every time someone contacted us.\nWe find that keeping track of all the mentors, the students, the projects, and the meta information is a necessary but time consuming task.\nWe wish we had a tool to help us do that.\nCoordinating meetings and reminding participants of what needs to be accomplished for deadlines is part of the cheerleading aspect of GSoC, we need to keep doing this.\n\nLastly, I want to thank again all participants, we could not do this without you.\nEach year we are impressed by the students who do great work and bring great contributions to the Jenkins community.\n\nGSoC 2020?\n\nYes, there will be Google Summer of Code 2020!\nWe plan to participate, and we are looking for project ideas, mentors and students.\nJenkins GSoC pages have been already updated towards the next year, and we invite everybody interested to join us next year!\n\nMain page with all contacts\n\nGSoC 2020 Project

If so, you rely on Jenkins update centers, website and issue tracker.\nAll these and many other services are maintained by the Jenkins Infrastructure Team.\nThis year the team handled more than 400 requests in the bugtracker, and many other informal requests.\nIn total, more than 30 people contributed to Jenkins infrastructure this year (website content is excluded).\nWe also deployed 4 new services, migrated 7 services from Azure Container Service to Azure Kubernetes Service and updated many other services.\nMore changes will happen in the next months, and we are looking for new INFRA team members!\n\nDocumentation.\nOnly last quarter we had 178 contributors to Jenkins documentation. It includes jenkins.io and other documentation hosted on GitHub, Wiki is not included.\nThere is also ongoing migration plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub ( announcement).\nSince the beginning of the project in Sep 2019, more than 150 plugin were migrated, and they got significant documentation revamp during the migration.\nYou can see the current status here.\nWe also work on introducing changelog automation in the project.\n123 plugins have already adopted the new changelog tools, powered by Release Drafter.\nAlso, we had more than 60 technical blog posts published on jenkins.io.\n\nConfiguration as Code was one of the most popular areas this year.\nJenkins Configuration as Code Plugin had more than 30 releases with new features and bug fixes.\nMore than 50 plugins have been also updated in order to offer better configuration-as-code support.\nAs a result, the JCasC Plugin got massive adoption this year (from 2000 to almost 8000 installations),\nand now it becomes a de-facto standard for managing Jenkins as code.\nThis year we also ran our very first CommunityBridge project devoted to JCasC Schema validation and developer tools.\n\nEvents and outreach programs.\nIn 2019 we participated in multiple conferences, including FOSDEM, DevOps World | Jenkins World, SCALE.\nMore than 40 Jenkins Area Meetups were organized across the world, and there were many other meetups devoted to Jenkins.\nWe also kept expanding our outreach programs.\nIn total we had 12 students who participated in Google Summer of Code, Outreachy and newly introduced Community Bridge.\nWe also had the biggest ever Hacktoberfest with 664 pull requests and 102 participants.\nThese outreach programs help us to deliver new features in Jenkins.\nFor example, this year we added Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab and a new Plugin Installation Manager Tool during GSoC,\nand Outreachy resulted in a new Audit Log Plugin.\n\nWhere did we get those stats?\nGitHub stats came from the CDF DevStats service.\nThese stats include all repositories in the jenkinsci organization and most popular repositories in jenkins-infra, Jenkins X and other organizations/repositories within the project are not included.\nOther stats came from project reports, component changelogs, Jenkins usage statistics service, plugin releases history.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nYear 2020 will be pretty busy for the Jenkins project.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want the project to succeed.\nAs it was written Board elections blogpost,\nthere are many areas to consider: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nIn the coming months there will be a lot of discussions in mailing lists and special interest groups,\nand we invite all teams to work on their roadmaps and to communicate them in the community.\n\nNext month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a Jenkins stand there.\nOn January 31st we will also host a traditional contributor summit in Brussels,\nwhere we will talk about next steps for the project, in terms of technical roadmaps and the project governance.\nIf you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join us at the summit!\nSee this thread for more information.\n\nWe also plan to continue all outreach programs.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement),\nand we will be also interested to consider non-coding projects as a part of other programs like CommunityBridge.\nWe also work on improving contribution guidelines for newcomers and expert contributors.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day.\nWe are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size.\nEverything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc.\nTHANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!","title":"Happy New Year!

Tyler Croy on the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nDaniel Beck was elected as Security Officer\n\nAlyssa Tong was elected as Events Officer\n\nNominations for Infrastructure, Release and Documentation officer positions were uncontested.\n\nOlivier Vernin was elected as Infrastructure Officer (uncontested)\n\nOliver Gondža was elected as Release Officer (uncontested)\n\nMark Waite was elected as Documentation Officer (uncontested)\n\nIf you are interested to learn more, please see the blog post below.\n\nBoard election details\n\nThe voting results are:\n\nOleg Nenashev (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nMark Waite loses to Oleg Nenashev by 181–127\n\nUllrich Hafner loses to Oleg Nenashev by 198–115, loses to Mark Waite by 171–133\n\nAlex Earl loses to Oleg Nenashev by 225–82, loses to Ullrich Hafner by 168–128\n\nOliver Gondža loses to Oleg Nenashev by 227–76, loses to Alex Earl by 151–136\n\nZhao Xiaojie (aka Rick) loses to Oleg Nenashev by 233–82, loses to Oliver Gondža by 160–131\n\nAlthough Mark Waite came second in the voting results, being on the board would violate the Corporate Involvement clause which states that \"the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%\".\nBased on that rule, the third seat Alex Earl will join the Jenkins board.\nAt the same time, Mark Waite will take the newly introduced role of Documentation officer.\n\nAll new board members are elected for a 2-year term, unless they step down earlier.\nThe estimated end of term for them is December 02, 2021.\nThe actual date will depend on the election schedule in 2021.\n\nOfficer election details\n\nWe have reelected all 5 officers for the new 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2020.\n\nAlyssa Tong won the biggest support as an Events officer ( voting results)\n\nDaniel Beck won the biggest support as a Security officer ( voting results)\n\nWhen an officer position has only one candidate that is willing to accept the nomination, there is no reason to vote on that position.\nThis year some nominees declined the nominations before the election happened, and 3 officer nominations were finally uncontested:\nOlivier Vernin - infrastructure officer,\nOliver Gondža - release officer,\nMark Waite - documentation officer.\n\nStatistics\n\nHere are some voting stats from these elections:\n\nTotal number of eligible accounts: 91,015\n\nTotal number of registered voters: 831\n\nTotal number of votes: 343\n\nThis election was hosted on the Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS).\nWhile preparing for the elections, we discovered that CIVS is unable to support our large number of eligible voters.\nWe created a voter registration system to identify voters and then registered those voters with CIVS.\nThe workaround required a slight voting delay.\nSpecial thanks to Olivier Vernin and Tracy Miranda who made it possible!\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nIn short term, the renewed board will focus on running the Jenkins governance processes (meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining next steps towards improving the project.\nOne of the priorities will be to organize knowledge and permission transfers to new board members so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThere are also pending activities like Jenkins' transition to Continuous Delivery Foundation which require attention from board members.\n\nFor longer term, there are some ideas floating around:\n  roadmap for key components,\n  long-anticipated architecture changes (UX revamp, pluggable storage, cloud native Jenkins),\n  adopting Linux Foundation best practices like Core Infrastructure Initiative,\n  contributor onboarding,\n  etc.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for further evolvement of the Jenkins project,\nand the board could help to facilitate them in the community.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to do so!\n\nFeedback\n\nWe will also also plan to conduct a public retrospective at one of the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meetings.\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process.\nPlease use the following channels for feedback and suggestions:\n\nThere is a Retrospective document in Google Docs.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\n\nFor ideas about the project improvements and next steps for the board,\nplease use the Jenkins Developers mailing list.\n\nFor private feedback, please send an email to the Jenkins Board or to Tracy Miranda.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2019 election announcement\n\n2019 election updates on Nov 08\n\nRetrospective

of Contents\n\nThe Problem\n\nCode Duplication And Security\nA Branch Is Not A Feature\nDocumentation\n\nThe Solution\n\nCode Duplication And Security\nA Branch Is Not A Feature\nDocumentation\n\nThis post will describe some common problems I’ve had with Jenkins and how I solved them by developing Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin.\n\nThe Problem\n\nI was often struggling with the same issues when working with Jenkins:\n\nCode duplication and security - Jenkinsfiles in every repository.\n\nA branch is not a feature - Parameterized jobs on master branch often mix parameters relevant for different features.\n\nPoorly documented trigger plugins - Proper documented services but poorly documented consuming plugins.\n\nCode Duplication And Security\n\nHaving Jenkinsfiles in every Git repository allows developers to let those files diverge. Developers pushes forward with their projects and it is hard to maintain patterns to share code.\n\nI have, almost, solved code duplication with shared libraries but it does not allow me to setup a strict pattern that must be followed. Any developer can still decide to not invoke the features provided by the shared library.\n\nThere is also the security aspect of letting developers run any code from the Jenkinsfiles. Developers might, for example, print passwords gathered from credentials. Letting developers execute any code on the Jenkins nodes just does not seem right to me.\n\nA Branch Is Not A Feature\n\nIn Bitbucket there are projects and each project has a collection of git repositories. Something like this:\n\nPROJ_1\n\nREPO_1\n\nREPO_2\n\nPROJ_2\n\nREPO_3\n\nLets think about some features we want to provide for these repositories:\n\nPull request verification\n\nBuilding snapshot (or pre release if you will)\n\nBuilding releases\n\nIf the developers are use to the repositories being organized like this in Bitbucket, should we not organize them the same way in Jenkins? And if they browse Jenkins should they not find one job per feature, like pull-request, snapshot and release? Each job with parameters only relevant for that feature. I think so! Like this:\n\n/ - Jenkins root\n\n/PROJ_1 - A folder, lists git repositories\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1 - A folder, lists jobs relevant for that repo.\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1/release - A job, performs releases.\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1/snapshot - A job, performs snapshot releases.\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1/pull-request - A job, verifies pull requests.\n\n…​\n\nIn this example, both snapshot and release jobs might work with the same git branch. The difference is the feature they provide. Their parameters can be well documented as you don’t have to mix parameters relevant for releases and those relevant for snapshots. This cannot be done with Multibranch Pipeline Plugin where you specify parameters as properties per branch.\n\nDocumentation\n\nWebhooks are often well documented in the services providing them. See:\n\nBitbucket Cloud\n\nBitbucket Server\n\nGitHub\n\nGitLab\n\nGogs and Gitea\n\nAssembla\n\nJira\n\nIt bothered me that, even if I understood these webhooks, I was unable to use them. Because I needed to perform development in the plugin I was using in order to provide whatever value from the webhook to the build. That process could take months from PR to actual release. Such a simple thing should really not be an issue.\n\nThe Solution\n\nMy solution is pretty much back to basics : We have an automation server (Jenkins) and we want to trigger it on external webhooks. We want to gather information from that webhook and provide it to our build. In order to support it I have created the Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin.\n\nThe latest docs are available in the repo and I also have a fully working example with GitLab implemented using configuration-as-code. See the repository here.\n\nCode Duplication And Security\n\nI establish a convention that all developers must follow. Instead of letting the developers explicitly invoke the infrastructure from Jenkinsfiles. There are rules to follow, like:\n\nAll git repositories should be built from the root of the repo.\n\nIf it contains a gradlew\n\nBuild is done with./gradlew build\n\nRelease is done with./gradlew release\n\n…​ and so on\n\nIf it contains a package.json\n\nBuild is done with npm run build\n\nRelease is done with npm run release\n\n…​ and so on\n\nWith these rules, pipelines can be totally generic and no Jenkinsfiles are needed in the repositories. Some git repositories may, for some reason, need to disable test cases. That can be solved by allowing repositories to add a special file, perhaps jenkins-settings.json, let the infrastructure discover and act on its content.\n\nThis also helps the developers even when not doing CI. When they clone a new, to them unknown, repository they will know what commands can be issued and their semantics.\n\nA Branch Is Not A Feature\n\nI implement:\n\nJenkins job configurations - With Job DSL.\n\nJenkins build process - With Pipelines and Shared Library.\n\nBy integrating with the git service from Job DSL I can automatically find the git repositories. I create jobs dynamically organized in folders. Also invoking the git service to setup webhooks triggering those jobs. The jobs are ordinary pipelines, not multibranch, and they don’t use Jenkinsfile from Git but instead Jenksinfile configured in the job using Job DSL. So that all job configurations and pipelines are under version control. This is all happening here.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe plugin uses JSONPath, and also XPath, to extract values from JSON and provide them to the build. Letting the user pick whatever is needed from the webhook. It also has a regular expression filter to allow not triggering for some conditions.\n\nThe plugin is not very big, just being the glue between the webhook, JSONPath / XPath and regular expression. All these parts are very well documented already and I do my best supporting the plugin. That way this is a very well documented solution to use!","title":"Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin","tags":["webhooks","trigger","pipeline","security","scalability"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#98a8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/19e71/tomasbjerre.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/77b35/tomasbjerre.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/d4a57/tomasbjerre.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/19e71/tomasbjerre.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/68974/tomasbjerre.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/ef6ff/tomasbjerre.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/8257c/tomasbjerre.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/6766a/tomasbjerre.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/22bfc/tomasbjerre.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://bjurr.com/","github":"tomasbjerre","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Tomas Bjerre is an experienced fullstack software developer.
