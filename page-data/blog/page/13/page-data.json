If so, you rely on Jenkins update centers, website and issue tracker.\nAll these and many other services are maintained by the Jenkins Infrastructure Team.\nThis year the team handled more than 400 requests in the bugtracker, and many other informal requests.\nIn total, more than 30 people contributed to Jenkins infrastructure this year (website content is excluded).\nWe also deployed 4 new services, migrated 7 services from Azure Container Service to Azure Kubernetes Service and updated many other services.\nMore changes will happen in the next months, and we are looking for new INFRA team members!\n\nDocumentation.\nOnly last quarter we had 178 contributors to Jenkins documentation. It includes jenkins.io and other documentation hosted on GitHub, Wiki is not included.\nThere is also ongoing migration plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub ( announcement).\nSince the beginning of the project in Sep 2019, more than 150 plugin were migrated, and they got significant documentation revamp during the migration.\nYou can see the current status here.\nWe also work on introducing changelog automation in the project.\n123 plugins have already adopted the new changelog tools, powered by Release Drafter.\nAlso, we had more than 60 technical blog posts published on jenkins.io.\n\nConfiguration as Code was one of the most popular areas this year.\nJenkins Configuration as Code Plugin had more than 30 releases with new features and bug fixes.\nMore than 50 plugins have been also updated in order to offer better configuration-as-code support.\nAs a result, the JCasC Plugin got massive adoption this year (from 2000 to almost 8000 installations),\nand now it becomes a de-facto standard for managing Jenkins as code.\nThis year we also ran our very first CommunityBridge project devoted to JCasC Schema validation and developer tools.\n\nEvents and outreach programs.\nIn 2019 we participated in multiple conferences, including FOSDEM, DevOps World | Jenkins World, SCALE.\nMore than 40 Jenkins Area Meetups were organized across the world, and there were many other meetups devoted to Jenkins.\nWe also kept expanding our outreach programs.\nIn total we had 12 students who participated in Google Summer of Code, Outreachy and newly introduced Community Bridge.\nWe also had the biggest ever Hacktoberfest with 664 pull requests and 102 participants.\nThese outreach programs help us to deliver new features in Jenkins.\nFor example, this year we added Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab and a new Plugin Installation Manager Tool during GSoC,\nand Outreachy resulted in a new Audit Log Plugin.\n\nWhere did we get those stats?\nGitHub stats came from the CDF DevStats service.\nThese stats include all repositories in the jenkinsci organization and most popular repositories in jenkins-infra, Jenkins X and other organizations/repositories within the project are not included.\nOther stats came from project reports, component changelogs, Jenkins usage statistics service, plugin releases history.\n\nWhatâ€™s next?\n\nYear 2020 will be pretty busy for the Jenkins project.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want the project to succeed.\nAs it was written Board elections blogpost,\nthere are many areas to consider: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nIn the coming months there will be a lot of discussions in mailing lists and special interest groups,\nand we invite all teams to work on their roadmaps and to communicate them in the community.\n\nNext month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a Jenkins stand there.\nOn January 31st we will also host a traditional contributor summit in Brussels,\nwhere we will talk about next steps for the project, in terms of technical roadmaps and the project governance.\nIf you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join us at the summit!\nSee this thread for more information.\n\nWe also plan to continue all outreach programs.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement),\nand we will be also interested to consider non-coding projects as a part of other programs like CommunityBridge.\nWe also work on improving contribution guidelines for newcomers and expert contributors.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day.\nWe are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size.\nEverything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc.\nTHANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!","title":"Happy New Year!

Note that this list is subject to change.\n\nWhat does mentoring involve?\n\nPotential mentors are invited to read the information for mentors.\nNote that being a GSoC mentor does not require expert knowledge of Jenkins.\nMentors do not work alone. We make sure that every project has at least two mentors.\nGSoC org admins will help to find technical advisers, so you can study together with your students.\n\nMentoring takes about 5 to 8 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).\nMentors provide guidance, coaching, and sometimes a bit of cheerleading.\nThey review student proposals, pull-requests and the students presentations\nat the evaluation phase.\nThey fill in the Google provided evaluation report form at the end of coding periods.\n\nWhat do you get in exchange?\n\nIn return of mentoring, a student works on your project full time for four months.\nThink about the projects that youâ€™ve always wanted to do but never had the timeâ€¦â€‹\n\nHaving a mentoring opportunity also means that you get to improve your management and people skills.\n\nAs well, up to two mentors per organization are eligible to participate in the Google Mentor Summit taking place each year.\nThe Jenkins Org Admins try to send different mentors each year.\nIt is also possible to win an additional seat at the summit in the \"last minute draw\"\n(Google draws mentors at random to fill the cancellations and empty seats).\n\nSee this post from one of the 2019 mentors\non the kind of experience this was.\n\nGSoC is a pretty good return on the investment!\n\nFor any question, you can find the GSoC Org Admins,\nmentors and participants on the GSoC SIG Gitter chat.","title":"Google Summer of Code 2020 call for Project ideas and Mentors","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2020","community","events","developer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#7898d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/7b80f/martinda.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/4c2a5/martinda.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/8bef2/martinda.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/7b80f/martinda.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/2864c/martinda.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/5abcf/martinda.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/410d2/martinda.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/6f814/martinda.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/ca864/martinda.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":136}}},"blog":null,"github":"martinda","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Martin is a Jenkins community member.

Tyler Croy on the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nDaniel Beck was elected as Security Officer\n\nAlyssa Tong was elected as Events Officer\n\nNominations for Infrastructure, Release and Documentation officer positions were uncontested.\n\nOlivier Vernin was elected as Infrastructure Officer (uncontested)\n\nOliver GondÅ¾a was elected as Release Officer (uncontested)\n\nMark Waite was elected as Documentation Officer (uncontested)\n\nIf you are interested to learn more, please see the blog post below.\n\nBoard election details\n\nThe voting results are:\n\nOleg Nenashev (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nMark Waite loses to Oleg Nenashev by 181â€“127\n\nUllrich Hafner loses to Oleg Nenashev by 198â€“115, loses to Mark Waite by 171â€“133\n\nAlex Earl loses to Oleg Nenashev by 225â€“82, loses to Ullrich Hafner by 168â€“128\n\nOliver GondÅ¾a loses to Oleg Nenashev by 227â€“76, loses to Alex Earl by 151â€“136\n\nZhao Xiaojie (aka Rick) loses to Oleg Nenashev by 233â€“82, loses to Oliver GondÅ¾a by 160â€“131\n\nAlthough Mark Waite came second in the voting results, being on the board would violate the Corporate Involvement clause which states that \"the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%\".\nBased on that rule, the third seat Alex Earl will join the Jenkins board.\nAt the same time, Mark Waite will take the newly introduced role of Documentation officer.\n\nAll new board members are elected for a 2-year term, unless they step down earlier.\nThe estimated end of term for them is December 02, 2021.\nThe actual date will depend on the election schedule in 2021.\n\nOfficer election details\n\nWe have reelected all 5 officers for the new 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2020.\n\nAlyssa Tong won the biggest support as an Events officer ( voting results)\n\nDaniel Beck won the biggest support as a Security officer ( voting results)\n\nWhen an officer position has only one candidate that is willing to accept the nomination, there is no reason to vote on that position.\nThis year some nominees declined the nominations before the election happened, and 3 officer nominations were finally uncontested:\nOlivier Vernin - infrastructure officer,\nOliver GondÅ¾a - release officer,\nMark Waite - documentation officer.\n\nStatistics\n\nHere are some voting stats from these elections:\n\nTotal number of eligible accounts: 91,015\n\nTotal number of registered voters: 831\n\nTotal number of votes: 343\n\nThis election was hosted on the Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS).\nWhile preparing for the elections, we discovered that CIVS is unable to support our large number of eligible voters.\nWe created a voter registration system to identify voters and then registered those voters with CIVS.\nThe workaround required a slight voting delay.\nSpecial thanks to Olivier Vernin and Tracy Miranda who made it possible!\n\nWhatâ€™s next for the board?\n\nIn short term, the renewed board will focus on running the Jenkins governance processes (meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining next steps towards improving the project.\nOne of the priorities will be to organize knowledge and permission transfers to new board members so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThere are also pending activities like Jenkins' transition to Continuous Delivery Foundation which require attention from board members.\n\nFor longer term, there are some ideas floating around:\n  roadmap for key components,\n  long-anticipated architecture changes (UX revamp, pluggable storage, cloud native Jenkins),\n  adopting Linux Foundation best practices like Core Infrastructure Initiative,\n  contributor onboarding,\n  etc.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for further evolvement of the Jenkins project,\nand the board could help to facilitate them in the community.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about whatâ€™s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to do so!\n\nFeedback\n\nWe will also also plan to conduct a public retrospective at one of the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meetings.\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process.\nPlease use the following channels for feedback and suggestions:\n\nThere is a Retrospective document in Google Docs.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\n\nFor ideas about the project improvements and next steps for the board,\nplease use the Jenkins Developers mailing list.\n\nFor private feedback, please send an email to the Jenkins Board or to Tracy Miranda.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2019 election announcement\n\n2019 election updates on Nov 08\n\nRetrospective

of Contents\n\nThe Problem\n\nCode Duplication And Security\nA Branch Is Not A Feature\nDocumentation\n\nThe Solution\n\nCode Duplication And Security\nA Branch Is Not A Feature\nDocumentation\n\nThis post will describe some common problems Iâ€™ve had with Jenkins and how I solved them by developing Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin.\n\nThe Problem\n\nI was often struggling with the same issues when working with Jenkins:\n\nCode duplication and security - Jenkinsfiles in every repository.\n\nA branch is not a feature - Parameterized jobs on master branch often mix parameters relevant for different features.\n\nPoorly documented trigger plugins - Proper documented services but poorly documented consuming plugins.\n\nCode Duplication And Security\n\nHaving Jenkinsfiles in every Git repository allows developers to let those files diverge. Developers pushes forward with their projects and it is hard to maintain patterns to share code.\n\nI have, almost, solved code duplication with shared libraries but it does not allow me to setup a strict pattern that must be followed. Any developer can still decide to not invoke the features provided by the shared library.\n\nThere is also the security aspect of letting developers run any code from the Jenkinsfiles. Developers might, for example, print passwords gathered from credentials. Letting developers execute any code on the Jenkins nodes just does not seem right to me.\n\nA Branch Is Not A Feature\n\nIn Bitbucket there are projects and each project has a collection of git repositories. Something like this:\n\nPROJ_1\n\nREPO_1\n\nREPO_2\n\nPROJ_2\n\nREPO_3\n\nLets think about some features we want to provide for these repositories:\n\nPull request verification\n\nBuilding snapshot (or pre release if you will)\n\nBuilding releases\n\nIf the developers are use to the repositories being organized like this in Bitbucket, should we not organize them the same way in Jenkins? And if they browse Jenkins should they not find one job per feature, like pull-request, snapshot and release? Each job with parameters only relevant for that feature. I think so! Like this:\n\n/ - Jenkins root\n\n/PROJ_1 - A folder, lists git repositories\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1 - A folder, lists jobs relevant for that repo.\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1/release - A job, performs releases.\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1/snapshot - A job, performs snapshot releases.\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1/pull-request - A job, verifies pull requests.\n\nâ€¦â€‹\n\nIn this example, both snapshot and release jobs might work with the same git branch. The difference is the feature they provide. Their parameters can be well documented as you donâ€™t have to mix parameters relevant for releases and those relevant for snapshots. This cannot be done with Multibranch Pipeline Plugin where you specify parameters as properties per branch.\n\nDocumentation\n\nWebhooks are often well documented in the services providing them. See:\n\nBitbucket Cloud\n\nBitbucket Server\n\nGitHub\n\nGitLab\n\nGogs and Gitea\n\nAssembla\n\nJira\n\nIt bothered me that, even if I understood these webhooks, I was unable to use them. Because I needed to perform development in the plugin I was using in order to provide whatever value from the webhook to the build. That process could take months from PR to actual release. Such a simple thing should really not be an issue.\n\nThe Solution\n\nMy solution is pretty much back to basics : We have an automation server (Jenkins) and we want to trigger it on external webhooks. We want to gather information from that webhook and provide it to our build. In order to support it I have created the Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin.\n\nThe latest docs are available in the repo and I also have a fully working example with GitLab implemented using configuration-as-code. See the repository here.\n\nCode Duplication And Security\n\nI establish a convention that all developers must follow. Instead of letting the developers explicitly invoke the infrastructure from Jenkinsfiles. There are rules to follow, like:\n\nAll git repositories should be built from the root of the repo.\n\nIf it contains a gradlew\n\nBuild is done with./gradlew build\n\nRelease is done with./gradlew release\n\nâ€¦â€‹ and so on\n\nIf it contains a package.json\n\nBuild is done with npm run build\n\nRelease is done with npm run release\n\nâ€¦â€‹ and so on\n\nWith these rules, pipelines can be totally generic and no Jenkinsfiles are needed in the repositories. Some git repositories may, for some reason, need to disable test cases. That can be solved by allowing repositories to add a special file, perhaps jenkins-settings.json, let the infrastructure discover and act on its content.\n\nThis also helps the developers even when not doing CI. When they clone a new, to them unknown, repository they will know what commands can be issued and their semantics.\n\nA Branch Is Not A Feature\n\nI implement:\n\nJenkins job configurations - With Job DSL.\n\nJenkins build process - With Pipelines and Shared Library.\n\nBy integrating with the git service from Job DSL I can automatically find the git repositories. I create jobs dynamically organized in folders. Also invoking the git service to setup webhooks triggering those jobs. The jobs are ordinary pipelines, not multibranch, and they donâ€™t use Jenkinsfile from Git but instead Jenksinfile configured in the job using Job DSL. So that all job configurations and pipelines are under version control. This is all happening here.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe plugin uses JSONPath, and also XPath, to extract values from JSON and provide them to the build. Letting the user pick whatever is needed from the webhook. It also has a regular expression filter to allow not triggering for some conditions.\n\nThe plugin is not very big, just being the glue between the webhook, JSONPath / XPath and regular expression. All these parts are very well documented already and I do my best supporting the plugin. That way this is a very well documented solution to use!","title":"Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin","tags":["webhooks","trigger","pipeline","security","scalability"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#98a8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/19e71/tomasbjerre.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/77b35/tomasbjerre.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/d4a57/tomasbjerre.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/19e71/tomasbjerre.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/68974/tomasbjerre.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/ef6ff/tomasbjerre.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/8257c/tomasbjerre.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/6766a/tomasbjerre.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/22bfc/tomasbjerre.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://bjurr.com/","github":"tomasbjerre","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Tomas Bjerre is an experienced fullstack software developer.

In this post Iâ€™ll show how the new AWS Secrets Manager Credentials Provider plugin allows you to marshal your secrets into one place, and use them securely from Jenkins.\n\nWhen CI/CD pipelines moved to the public cloud, credential management did not evolve with them. If youâ€™re in this situation, you may have seen a number of tactical workarounds to keep Jenkins builds talking to the services they depend on. The workarounds range from bad (hardcoding plaintext secrets into Git) to merely painful (wrangling Hiera EYAML), but their common feature is that they tend to make copies of secrets beyond the reach of automation. This increases their attack surface, makes routine key rotation impractical, and makes remediation difficult after a breach.\n\nThe good news is that there is a better way!\n\nAWS Secrets Manager is a comprehensive solution for secure secret storage. You define a secret just once for your whole AWS account, then you give your consumers permission to use the secrets. Secrets Manager lets you manage a secret entry (name and metadata) separately from its value, and it integrates with other AWS services that you already use:\n\nSecret entry management: Manual (Web console, AWS CLI) or with an infrastructure management tool ( Terraform, CloudFormation etc.)\n\nSecret value management: Manual (Web console, AWS CLI) or automatic (secret rotation Lambda function).\n\nAccess control: AWS IAM policies (for both applications and human operators).\n\nSecret encryption: Amazon KMS automatically encrypts the secret value. Use either the accountâ€™s default KMS key, or a customer-managed KMS key.\n\nAuditing: AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Events.\n\nA couple of teams in my company started to use Secrets Manager from Jenkins jobs by calling the AWS CLI, but this remained a niche approach as it was quite unwieldy. There was clearly an appetite to integrate key developer apps with a centralised secrets store, but production-ready integrations were needed for wider adoption. So this year I created the AWS Secrets Manager Credentials Provider plugin for Jenkins, with help from friends in the Jenkins community, to do exactly that.\n\nThis is how you set it upâ€¦â€‹\n\nInstall the plugin from the Jenkins update center.\n\nGive Jenkins read-only access to Secrets Manager with an IAM policy.\n\n(Optional) Configure the plugin, either through the Global Configuration screen or Jenkins Configuration As Code.\n\nThis is how you use itâ€¦â€‹\n\nCreate your build secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. (You can start by uploading secrets via the AWS CLI. More sophisticated methods of secret creation are also available.)\n\nView the credentials in the Jenkins UI, to check that Jenkins can see them.\n\nBind the credentials by ID in your Jenkins job.\n\nThe provider supports the following standard Jenkins credential types:\n\nSecret Text\n\nUsername With Password\n\nSSH User Private Key\n\nPKCS#12 Certificate\n\nAnd it has powerful advantages over quick-fix tactical solutions:\n\nYour Jenkins jobs consume the credentials with no knowledge of Secrets Manager, so they stay vendor-independent.\n\nThe provider caches relevant Secrets Manager API calls, for a quicker and more reliable experience.\n\nThe provider integrates with the ecosystem of existing Jenkins credential consumers, such as the Git and SSH Agent plugins.\n\nThe provider records credential usage in the central Jenkins credentials tracking log.\n\nJenkins can use multiple credentials providers concurrently, so you can incrementally migrate credentials to Secrets Manager while consuming other credentials from your existing providers.\n\nAfter the pluginâ€™s first public release, developers at other companies adopted it too. It has had contributions so far from people at Elsevier, GoDaddy, and Northeastern University, as well as the fantastic Jenkins core team. We even got fan mail for our work!\n\nIn enterprise security, \"The important things are always simple. The simple things are always hard. The easy way is always mined.\" ( @thegrugq) Itâ€™s easy to buy a shiny â€˜next generation' security appliance and drop it into your network. But itâ€™s hard to embed the security fundamentals (like secrets management, OS patching, secure development) across your organisation. This Jenkins plugin is part of the effort [ 1 ] to take one of the persistent hard problems in security, and make it easier for everyone.\n\n1.

However, if you must use scripted pipeline, then\nIâ€™m going to cover how to matrix build platforms and tools using scripted\npipeline.  The examples in this post are modeled after the declarative pipeline\nmatrix examples.\n\nMatrix building with scripted pipeline\n\nThe following Jenkins scripted pipeline will build combinations across two\nmatrix axes.

So\nos:linux and browser:firefox are both valid agent labels.  The node\nexpression os:linux && browser:firefox will search for Jenkins agents which\nhave both labels.\n\nScreenshot of matrix pipeline\n\nThe following is a screenshot of the pipeline code above running in a sandbox\nJenkins environment.\n\nAdding static choices\n\nIt is useful for users to be able to customize building matrices when a build\nis triggered.  Adding static choices requires only a few changes to the above\nscript.  Static choices as in we hard code the question and matrix filters.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\n(response['PLATFORM'] == 'all' || response['PLATFORM'] == axis['PLATFORM']) &&\n    (response['BROWSER'] == 'all' || response['BROWSER'] == axis['BROWSER']) &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'safari' && axis['PLATFORM'] == 'linux') &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'edge' && axis['PLATFORM'] != 'windows')\n}\n\nThe pipeline code then renders the following choice dialog.\n\nWhen a user chooses the customized options, the pipeline reacts to the\nrequested options.\n\nAdding dynamic choices\n\nDynamic choices means the choice dialog for users to customize the build is\ngenerated from the Map matrix_axes rather than being something a pipeline\ndeveloper hard codes.\n\nFor user experience (UX), youâ€™ll want your choices to automatically reflect the\nmatrix axis options you have available.  For example, letâ€™s say you want to add\na new dimension for Java to the matrix.\n\n// you can add more axes and this will still work\nMap matrix_axes = [\n    PLATFORM: ['linux', 'windows', 'mac'],\n    JAVA: ['openjdk8', 'openjdk10', 'openjdk11'],\n    BROWSER: ['firefox', 'chrome', 'safari', 'edge']\n]\n\nTo support dynamic choices, your choice and matrix axis filter needs to be\nupdated to the following.\n\nchoice(\n                choices: ['all'] + options.sort(),\n                description: \"Choose a single ${key.toLowerCase()} or all to run tests.\",\n                name: key)\n        })\n}\n\n// filter the matrix axes since\n// Safari is not available on Linux and\n// Edge is only available on Windows\nList axes = getMatrixAxes(matrix_axes).findAll { axis ->\n    response.every { key, choice ->\n        choice == 'all' || choice == axis[key]\n    } &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'safari' && axis['PLATFORM'] == 'linux') &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'edge' && axis['PLATFORM'] != 'windows')\n}\n\nIt will dynamically generate choices based on available matrix axes and will\nautomatically filter if users customize it.  Hereâ€™s an example dialog and\nrendered choice when the pipeline executes.\n\nFull pipeline example with dynamic choices\n\nThe following script is the full pipeline example which contains dynamic\nchoices.\n\n// you can add more axes and this will still work\nMap matrix_axes = [\n    PLATFORM: ['linux', 'windows', 'mac'],\n    JAVA: ['openjdk8', 'openjdk10', 'openjdk11'],\n    BROWSER: ['firefox', 'chrome', 'safari', 'edge']\n]\n\n@NonCPS\nList getMatrixAxes(Map matrix_axes) {\n    List axes = []\n    matrix_axes.each { axis, values ->\n        List axisList = []\n        values.each { value ->\n            axisList << [(axis): value]\n        }\n        axes \nchoice(\n                choices: ['all'] + options.sort(),\n                description: \"Choose a single ${key.toLowerCase()} or all to run tests.\",\n                name: key)\n        })\n}\n\n// filter the matrix axes since\n// Safari is not available on Linux and\n// Edge is only available on Windows\nList axes = getMatrixAxes(matrix_axes).findAll { axis ->\n    response.every { key, choice ->\n        choice == 'all' || choice == axis[key]\n    } &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'safari' && axis['PLATFORM'] == 'linux') &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'edge' && axis['PLATFORM'] != 'windows')\n}\n\n// parallel task map\nMap tasks = [failFast: false]\n\nfor(int i = 0; i\"${k}=${v}\"\n    }\n    // let's say you have diverse agents among Windows, Mac and Linux all of\n    // which have proper labels for their platform and what browsers are\n    // available on those agents.\n    String nodeLabel = \"os:${axis['PLATFORM']} && browser:${axis['BROWSER']}\"\n    tasks[axisEnv.join(', ')] = { ->\n        node(nodeLabel) {\n            withEnv(axisEnv) {\n                stage(\"Build\") {\n                    echo nodeLabel\n                    sh 'echo Do Build for ${PLATFORM} - ${BROWSER}'\n                }\n                stage(\"Test\") {\n                    echo nodeLabel\n                    sh 'echo Do Build for ${PLATFORM} - ${BROWSER}'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstage(\"Matrix builds\") {\n    parallel(tasks)\n}\n\nBackground: How does it work?\n\nThe trick is in axes.combinations()*.sum().  Groovy combinations are a quick\nand easy way to perform a\ncartesian product.\n\nHereâ€™s a simpler example of how cartesian product works.  Take two simple lists\nand create combinations.\n\nList a = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nList b = [1, 2, 3]\n\n[a, b].combinations()\n\nThe result of [a, b].combinations() is the following.\n\n[\n    ['a', 1],\n    ['b', 1],\n    ['c', 1],\n    ['a', 2],\n    ['b', 2],\n    ['c', 2],\n    ['a', 3],\n    ['b', 3],\n    ['c', 3]\n]\n\nInstead of a, b, c and 1, 2, 3 letâ€™s do the same example again but instead using matrix maps.\n\nList java = [[java: 8], [java: 10]]\nList os = [[os: 'linux'], [os: 'freebsd']]\n\n[java, os].combinations()\n\nThe result of [java, os].combinations() is the following.\n\n[\n    [ [java:8],  [os:linux]   ],\n    [ [java:10], [os:linux]   ],\n    [ [java:8],  [os:freebsd] ],\n    [ [java:10], [os:freebsd] ]\n]\n\nIn order for us to easily use this as a single map we must add the maps\ntogether to create a single map.  For example, adding\n[java: 8] + [os: 'linux'] will render a single hashmap\n[java: 8, os: 'linux'].  This means we need our list of lists of maps to\nbecome a simple list of maps so that we can use them effectively in pipelines.\n\nTo accomplish this we make use of the\nGroovy spread\noperator ( *. in axes.combinations()*.sum()).\n\nLetâ€™s see the same java / os example again but with the spread operator being\nused.\n\nList java = [[java: 8], [java: 10]]\nList os = [[os: 'linux'], [os: 'freebsd']]\n\n[java, os].combinations()*.sum()\n\nThe result is the following.\n\n[\n    [ java: 8,  os: 'linux'],\n    [ java: 10, os: 'linux'],\n    [ java: 8,  os: 'freebsd'],\n    [ java: 10, os: 'freebsd']\n]\n\nWith the spread operator the end result of a list of maps which we can\neffectively use as matrix axes.  It also allows us to do neat matrix filtering\nwith the findAll {} Groovy List method.\n\nExposing a shared library pipeline step\n\nThe best user experience is to expose the above code as a shared library\npipeline step.  As an example, I have added\nvars/getMatrixAxes.groovy\nto Jervis.  This provides a flexible shared library step which you can copy\ninto your own shared pipeline libraries.\n\nThe step becomes easy to use in the following way with a simple one dimension matrix.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\nMap matrix_axes = [\n    PLATFORM: ['linux', 'windows', 'mac'],\n]\n\nList axes = getMatrixAxes(matrix_axes)\n\n// alternately with a user prompt\n//List axes = getMatrixAxes(matrix_axes, user_prompt: true)\n\nHereâ€™s a more complex example using a two dimensional matrix with filtering.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\n!(axis['BROWSER'] == 'safari' && axis['PLATFORM'] == 'linux') &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'edge' && axis['PLATFORM'] != 'windows')\n}\n\nAnd again with a three dimensional matrix with filtering and prompting for user\ninput.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\n!(axis['BROWSER'] == 'safari' && axis['PLATFORM'] == 'linux') &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'edge' && axis['PLATFORM'] != 'windows')\n}\n\nThe script approval is not necessary for\nShared Libraries.\n\nIf you donâ€™t want to provide a shared step.  In order to expose matrix building\nto end-users, you must allow the following method approval in the script\napproval configuration.\n\nScript approval\n\nstaticMethod org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.DefaultGroovyMethods combinations java.util.Collection\n\nSummary\n\nWe covered how to perform matrix builds using scripted pipeline as well as how\nto prompt users for customizing the matrix build.  Additionally, an example was\nprovided where we exposed getting buildable matrix axes to users as an easy to\nuse Shared Library\nstep via vars/getMatrixAxes.groovy.  Using a shared library step is\ndefinitely the recommended way for admins to support users rather than trying\nto whitelist groovy methods.\n\nJervis shared pipeline library has supported matrix building since 2017 in Jenkins scripted pipelines.\n( see here and\nhere\nfor an example).","title":"Matrix building in scripted pipeline","tags":["matrix","pipeline","plugins","scripted"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/bf8e1/sgleske.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/914ee/sgleske.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/1c9ce/sgleske.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/bf8e1/sgleske.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/acb7c/sgleske.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/ef6ff/sgleske.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/8257c/sgleske.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/6766a/sgleske.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/22bfc/sgleske.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"samrocketman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A Senior Software Engineer at <a href=\"https://integralads.com/\">Integral Ad\nScience</a>, he develops a Jenkins solution to scale CI/CD onboarding for the\nentire company.

Most of these plugins are developed by third party developers or companies and can assist the user in a range of ways. They can extend the core functions, they can offer solutions to repetitive tasks or they can help with using a service. For example, they could help with publishing to an artifact store or spinning up cloud instances. However, before a plugin can use a network based service that requires credentials to connect, those credentials have to be typed in and saved somewhere. This raises the question, are those credentials stored securely? Or not?\nWhen I started looking at different plugins this was one of the first areas I investigated. I found a Jenkins security advisory describing this issue and came to the conclusion that this could be a problem in some plugins, albeit one that could be fixed easily. I found an example of weakly stored credentials in the Publish Over Dropbox Plugin; this plugin used a simple web form with a textbox element to display the token in the pluginâ€™s settings page. This token was stored in plaintext:\n\nThe following Jelly code was behind the web form and shows that a password field wasnâ€™t used:\n\nThe related plugin .xml file contained the secret key in plaintext:\n\nGLOBAL\nwoodspeed\n\nlYD2VnNz\nlYD2VnNz\n\nJenkins offers at least two ways to store credentials in an encrypted format:\n\nUsing a Secret type offered by Jenkins\n\nThird party plugin called Credentials Plugin\n\nThe first case is the easiest solution, because Jenkins will automatically handle the encryption and decryption.\n\nDevelopers should also use the password field tag instead of the textbox field, as shown in the following Jelly control example:\n\nIf you would like to know what other vulnerabilities I discovered and how to fix them, come and join us for the presentation in Lisbon!\nIn case you are unable to attend the conference, you can read more at Story of a Hundred Vulnerable Jenkins Plugins.","title":"Do Plugins Store Credentials In A Secure Way? - DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019","tags":["jenkins world","jenkinsworld","devopsworld2019","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"woodspeed","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Viktor is a security consultant and the 2019 Jenkins Security MVP.</p>\n</div>","id":"woodspeed","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Viktor Gazdag","slug":"/blog/author/woodspeed","twitter":"wucpi"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":96,"numPages":100,"currentPage":13}},
