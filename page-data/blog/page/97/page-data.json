Frederic Simon and Yoav Landman from JFrog will be presenting at the Silicon Valley JavaFX Users Group meeting at the Googleplex. Frederic and Yoav will be discussing and demonstrating how JFrog’s Artifactory works with Hudson to combine continuous integration with release management.\n\nJoin with the Artifactory team to realize the benefits of managing your software development life-cycle through continuous integration.\n\nFrederic Simon (JFrog Chief Architect) and Yoav Landman (JFrog CTO) will demonstrate how to automate large-scale multi-module projects, using a fully-integrated platform with Artifactory and Hudson.\n\nUsing Maven, Gradle or Ivy builds, it is now possible to dynamically automate and manage the pyramidal stacks of Unit, Functional, and Integration Tests.\n\nThis demo-based session will show you how Artifactory and Hudson together make it much easier to promote certified builds to milestone releases , and finally to general availability, while making sure all builds are fully reproducible.\n\nStaying dynamic all through the development process avoids code freeze and provides very accurate feedback loops. This is crucial for Developers, QA teams, System and Integration testers, Users, Customers, and all the remaining actors of the development process.\n\nIf you’re interested in attending, you can RSVP on the meetup page","title":"Tag team: Automating massive projects with Hudson and Artifactory","tags":["feedback","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

One of Alan’s branches old-data-monitor was merged into trunk with r28147 bringing with it some changes to help migrate older plugin datasets to newer formats.\n\nWhen I reached out to Alan earlier today on IRC ( #hudson on the Freenode) about the subject he agreed that polling the community for beta testers would be a good idea; this is where you come in. Per Alan’s message to the dev@ mailing list:\n\nVisit your \"Manage Hudson\" screen to see if the notice about old/unreadable data appears. I’ll be curious to see which of the old deprecated data structures are actually out there in people’s XML files.\n\nInstead of waiting for the release candidate to be packaged Wednesday evening, I’ve gone ahead and published the artifact from build #4544 which can be downloaded here: hudson.war\n\nIf you have an old Hudson installation with, testing this build would be incredibly useful. Alan went on to say:\n\nIf people find issues with OldDataMonitor, they should file them at issues.hudson-ci.org in \"core\" component and assign them to \"mindless\".\n\nThis change does not mutate any data (or at least it shouldn’t) so it should be safe, be on the look out for exceptions in Hudson’s log on startup.","title":"Call for Testers: The older the better","tags":["development","core","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

This gives those of us in the Hudson development community a good sense of what’s really important to our users, which in turn helps us decide where to focus our efforts. If you’re interested, you can see the top voted issues over at our JIRA server.\n\nA good number of those issues have been high on the list for a while - I’m actually in the early stages of work on a plugin to answer HUDSON-682, the current #1 most voted-for issue, two and a half years after it was opened. But I’m sure there are some equally useful features Hudson users would like to see added which aren’t on that list. So I’m asking you, dear readers: what are you looking for in Hudson that isn’t already there? Take a look around the existing issues - you may find a request that fits what you want lurking just out of the top 10, needing only your vote to push it into the spotlight. If no one’s yet created an issue requesting your desired feature, well, create one.\n\nOr, better still, write a plugin or contribute a patch yourself!\n\nEditor’s Note: If you’re interested in writing a plugin, you can check out Hudson’s wiki and/or this guide on the subject.\n\nAndrew Bayer ( abayer) has been a contributor to Hudson since early 2009, contributing to the ClearCase plugin, Hudson’s core and a small number of other plugins.
