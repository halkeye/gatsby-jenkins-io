To reduce costs for such an event, compared to other Jenkins Conferences organized by CloudBees this year, lunch was not provided and conference program was \"packed\" into afternoon. This let praqma get a \"reasonable\" cost for this nice event, but still have a high quality conference, with printed programs, goodies, and coffee break. All praqma team was involved to make this event as pleasant as possible for all attendees, thanks a lot to them for contributing ! +\n +\n +\n +\nConference was sold-out on friday morning, with 80 attendees. +\n +\n +\n +\nAfter Lars Kruse welcome speak, and CloudBees to announce partnership with Praqma for DK, the conference started with two options : either an introduction to Jenkins, or an open-space discussion (~barcamp-like) for those that already know it well. I joined a small group first discussing about pre-tested commit, and then we divert speaking about best-practices, job and test performances issues, etc. Was a great exchange with interesting feedback. +\n +\n +\n +\nThe rest of the conference was single-track. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oCA1lQnDBeE/UEybtag0JmI/AAAAAAAAHuY/QSofsZ_ae1M/s1600/IMAG0408.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oCA1lQnDBeE/UEybtag0JmI/AAAAAAAAHuY/QSofsZ_ae1M/s400/IMAG0408.jpg[image,width=400,height=300]]\n\n+\n +\n +\n1rst session was about \"_facilitate strategic reuse of software_\" using jenkins CI. This session exposed how a industrial company changed it's internal software development practices and team organization to share components and be more efficient. This for sure introduced some coordinations and integration costs but resulted in a significant productivity improvement. This talk was interesting as it demonstrate that highly industrial companies (here, a low energy consuming water pumps producer) today follow development practice to share component and use continuous integration practice to help. I just wondered speaker said \"Clearcase facilitated\" sharing components  -I wouldn't expected those two words in same sentence :P +\n +\n +\n +\n\"_Tales from the trenches_\" was a funny session explaining how Nokia came from stone age (manual integration with code freezes) to modern development practices. After reinventing the wheel with ~15 home made, perl-script based CI tools, they switched to Jenkins and Git as common tooling. Explanation on Git selection, evaluating multiple DVCS popularity, then migration from ClearCase, [.underline]#helping a lot# early adopters, and later evaluating benefits (1 day / week / developer) was very interesting. Conclusion was that, \"some tools a radically better\" and \"deep process renewal depends heavily on tools renewal\". +\n +\n +\n +\n\"_Continuous Code Inspection_\" talk explained use of industrial C++ coding standard and normative coding convention, with dedicated analysis tools. After explanation on those rules and tooling, a dedicated jenkins plugin was demonstrated. Such jenkins integration makes QA mostly a single checkbox to enable, and provide history graphs, reports, and external tools integration. Introduction was a little slow imho but content was demonstrating the power of jenkins plugin model to adapt software factory to specific industrial needs. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vgq2K5JLj30/UEyfE86usmI/AAAAAAAAHuw/q4vbgqguyuY/s1600/IMAG0409.jpg[image:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vgq2K5JLj30/UEyfE86usmI/AAAAAAAAHuw/q4vbgqguyuY/s320/IMAG0409.jpg[image,width=320,height=240]]\n\n+\n +\n +\nCoffee break with delicious Danish chocolates ... +\n +\n +\n +\nSony was presenting its \"_Huge Jenkins Cluster_\", with 4 controllers, some of them handling up to 6000 jobs, 300 agents, 7000 builds a day an executing 175,000 tests a day for android platforms. Development teams use a dedicated agent machine with android devices connected through USB. +\n +\n +\n +\nSuch a build farm requires a dedicated support team and monitoring/maintenance tooling. IT only provides the computer and maintain the OS, but all Jenkins stuff is under the hands of a dedicated team. They evaluate plugins and core upgrades, educate teams, and analyse errors. +\n +\n +\n +\nWith 45Gb for a single full android build, they have to monitor available disk space, and developed maintenance scripts to delete old build artifacts and cleanup /tmp. They also use a local git mirror to speed-up cloning, and integrated with CFEngine-managed infrastructure to ensure no update occurs as a agent is running a build. They also significantly optimized build speed by switching from NFS to SAN, and are now evaluating XFS. +\n +\n +\n +\nRemaining issue is about jenkins build queue (subject discussed on Jenkins Code Camp) because a 9 in the morning, thousand users connect to jenkins controller and the UI widget to expose the queue status hits the queue synchronisation bottleneck. +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\nNext talk was mine, exposing https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb[Jenkins Enterprise] and demonstrating one ouf our Enterprise plugins. I'm not pleased by my talk, both because my english is crappy (maybe you already noticed?) and also because I was not confident with the standard JE slides. Assuming I had more time to prepare this talk, and as a tribute to this Danish event, I'd have used a bunch of lego bricks pictures to present Cloudbee plugins. So I quickly left the slides to run a demo, setting-up Jenkins Enterprise to run https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb[pre-tested commits].

This light, generalist talk was welcome as last one after a heavy-technical afternoon. Lars exposed reason to switch to open-source : +\n +\n +\n +\n\ncosts - for sure,\n\nbut also open standards and interoperability,\n\nand contribution to public good.\n\n+\nThis last point distinguish \"_innovators_\" that create new content and contribute to the oss project, and \"_free riders_\" that only want to save money and consume other efforts. Lars didn't went deeper into what \"contributing\" can be about, but spending some time joining the mailing lists, exposing detailled bug report, or writing blogs or documentation about the issues you encounter is already a huge contribution to opensource. Organizing such a great user event also is ;) +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\nMeeting ended with a \"socialize\" time, sponsored by Pragmatic Research, with beer and sandwiches.

The first meet-up in June was only announced 8 days before, but had very good attendance  - the second was completely booked (15 seats).\n\nThe agenda is a short presentation of continuous integration and software validation to inspire the use of Jenkins, then a few words and terms about Jenkins and finally a live demo.\nThe live demo starts from scratch by downloaded the latest Jenkins java web archive, starts it, define a job on one of our Maven based java projects on Github. We add two easy plugins (Warnings and Task Scanner). Second part of the demo is about unit testing and coverage and we show how easy it is to enable a JUnit report and add a Cobertura coverage report if there is already unit tests for the project.\n\nThe meetups have about 90 minutes scheduled, including questions and the discussion session after the demo, where we serve pizza, beer and cola. The theoretical presentation and live demo is typically finished within one hour, even though we encourage our guests to ask questions and discuss whatever comes into their mind on the way. The relatively short time used for the introduction demonstrates how easy it is to get started with continuous integration and software validation using Jenkins.\n\nAs the live demo is based on a Java/Maven project we ask the guests about their technologies and try to relate that to their setup, so they know there also is an easy approach for them to use Jenkins.\n\nThe meeting is quite informal, and limited to 15 participants, leaving plenty of time to dicsuss and answer questions both before and after the meeting. We are always a few developers from Praqma to facilitate the discussions about the participants individual setup and questions.\n\nThese informal discussions are one of the main gains for us in Praqma, as it  is very interesting to share our experience with our guests and hear about all of their interesting challenges, that might have brough them north of Copenhagento attend our meeting.\n\nBecause these first meet-ups have been so popular and interesting we have decided to arrange them regularly in the future. Not just the Jenkins introduction, which will be repeated as long as there is an interest, but we are also making plans for meetups about Git, Mercurial and other topics.\n\nIf you’re interested in more Jenkins and CI related meet-ups in the Copenhagen area, visit our homepage or follow the #pragma hashtag on Twitter.\n\nWe also have a Jenkins User Event in Copenhagen coming in September.","title":"Report: Intro to Jenkins meet-up in Copenhagen","tags":["general","meetup","jenkinsci"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"31159e40-acb9-519d-b304-b05b9bac834a","slug":"/blog/2012/07/26/jenkins-user-conference-san-francisco-call-for-papers/","strippedHtml":"+\nlink:/node/tags/juc[Jenkins User Conference] is touring around the world and coming back to San Francisco for this September, colocated with JavaOne. +\n +\n\n+\nAnd here is https://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb[the call for papers] — we'd love users and plugin developers to share their experience with others.

I have this impression that Israeli people form a close-knit community on their own (somewhat like Japanese people do), perhaps because of the difference in the language or the culture. One of the great things about those communities are that people are well connected, and so reaching the right ears and spreading the ideas are easier. JUC Israel turns out to be the biggets JUC we had this year. Shlomi told me that some 230 people registered and 240 people showed up, and this negative last-minute cancellation ratio is unheard of! We had booths from sponsors, 2 concurrent tracks of technical talks, and wonderful Israeli food, in a nice hotel by the beach. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/296/category/5/created-monthly-list-2012-7[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712090747-e447b7c7.jpg[image] +\n] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nFor me, the conference started the night before, when JFrog folks took us to the Hudson restaurant, which was a wonderful steak house.

This is one of the areas where we made a lot of improvements lately, and one that I highlighted in my talk. I've always been feeling that this feature needs to be advertised more, so it was just perfect in that regard. It was also very useful for me personally, as I got some inspirations about improvements while he talks. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/384/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093014-62a9271b.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nSacha then talked about why the future of server-side applications are in PaaS. He had this one point where he said increasing the failure rate of software projects isn't necessarily a bad thing — if in a time frame of a year, you can do 10 projects and 2 succeed, then while that's only 20% success rate, it's better than doing 4 projects in the same time and having only 1 succeed. IOW, a machine-gun does a far more damage than a pistol, even though their accuracy can be much lower. And PaaS/Continuous-delivery plays a central role here becauses those are what lets you deliver 10 features in a year, instead of 4. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/397/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093400-c7816855.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nEyal from RedHat and Ronen from Ginger did two sessions showing off their use of Jenkins. One of the common theme in them is to use a text format (Puppet for Eyal and Groovy DSL for Ronen) to manage definitions of a large number of jobs. I think there's a lot of value in managing job definitions outside the current GUI, and I'm going to encourage Ronen to move his Groovy DSL project into the Jenkins CI project. I also felt that the template feature in Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees was validated, as it provides a similar capability (and in my opinion more easily deployable.) +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/391/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093221-0c896346.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nAnother talk that made a strong impression on me was the introductory plugin development talk from Noam, who works for JFrog and develops the Jenkins Artifactory plugin. I expected there to be only like 20-30 people, but it turns out about half the audience is there, indicating the high degree of interest to customizing Jenkins! In the past, all my favorite JUC talks came from those who I call \"super Jenkins admins\" who not only figure out how to combine some plugins, but also developed a few glue plugins.

I will be talking about Jenkins during my talk about BioUno.\n\nBOSC 2012 will be held just before ISMB 2012, while registration is through ISMB you don’t have to register for ISMB in order to register for BOSC.\n\nI will be at the event with some Jenkins stickers and available to answer questions you might have about BioUno and Jenkins!\n\nAbout BioUno\n\nBioUno is a project that uses Jenkins as basis for building\nbiology workflows.\nBioUno provides an alternative update center with custom plug-ins for\nbioinformatics tools like\nMrBayes,\nStructure,\nFigtree,\nBeast,\namong others.\n\nWhile the actual task of analysing or displaying data is handled by specific\ntools, that are wrapped by plug-ins, Jenkins is responsible for user control,\nweb interface, notifications, distributed execution, job schedule and\nmanagement, as well as other important low level tasks.\n\nBioUno is similar to BioHPC,\nGalaxy and\nTaverna, in that all these tools enable creating and managing pipelines using different bioinformatics tools.\n\nHowever, as it is using Jenkins, BioUno has the advantage of having an Open Source community of hackers that can answer questions and provide assistance for creating new plug-ins. There is plenty documentation for extending Jenkins\nand troubleshooting issues, as well as plenty existing plug-ins (that can be used as reference while writing new plug-ins).\n\nThere are projects and plug-ins that enable Jenkins to use resources in clouds or turn Jenkins into a Hadoop node, for big data processing. The next steps of the project include the deployment of BioUno to a computer facility, basic infrastructure for BioUno, definition of the process for releasing plug-ins, the creation of more plug-ins and a study on how to handle large data structures, used by many bioinformatics tools.\n\nThe project is being developed by TupiLabs under MIT License, and contributions and new plug-ins are welcome.","title":"Jenkins and Bioinformatics, catch us at BOSC 2012","tags":["general","cia","meetup"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":624,"numPages":100,"currentPage":79}},
