Here are 3 ways you can give back to the community to ensure that everyone benefits and Jenkins keeps growing…​\n\nGiving it back to the community #1: vendor+community=win\n\n+\nJenkins is becoming ubiquitous enough that tool vendors and service providers often find their users asking them to provide Jenkins plugins. The challenge for these companies is that they don’t necessarily possess the necessary Jenkins expertise to do one. +\n +\n\n+\nHere at the Jenkins project, what we are trying to do is to work with these people to deliver a plugin. It gets the job done a whole lot more quickly if the vendor brings in their expertise on their tool/services and we bring in our expertise on Jenkins plugin development. +\n +\n\n+\nFor example, we recently worked with https://www.soasta.com/press-releases/soasta-and-cloudbees-partner-to-deliver-first-jenkins-plugin-for-continuous-integration-on-mobile-platforms/[SOASTA] to help them open-source the plugin they developed in house, then help them add a whole bunch of new functionalities. By open-sourcing a plugin in the Jenkins project, vendors win as the community helps fix bugs and improve plugins. The Jenkins project wins by building relationship with vendors. And finally the users win by having more integrations. +\n +\n\n+\nSo the next time you ask your vendor to provide a Jenkins integration, please tell them to drop us a note, and we are happy to talk. +\n +\n\nGiving it back to the community #2: scratch your itch and take credit\n\n+\n\n+\nIf you are working for a company and hacking some Jenkins plugins for your team, then you should definitely consider contributing those changes back. Let’s take https://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/11/22/sony-contributes-to-jenkins-software-tool/[Robert and Tomas] for example, who contributed a number of significant plugins from Sony Mobile. +\n +\n\n+\nThe company wins, because it shows off their technical excellence. Plus the flexibility to let engineers work on these OSS projects helps them retain and attract high-caliber developers. It also lets the community shoulder some of the burdens of maintaining plugins.\n\n+\nYou win, because now you have more things to show to future employers. After all, GitHub is your new resume! And when you aren’t sure how to go about implementing a feature or fixing a bug, open-sourcing your plugin lets us jump in and get you unstuck.\n\n+\nThe community wins, thanks to your new awesome plugin.\n\n+\nBesides all of those pragmatic reasons, when you share something with others and they tell you how much it helped them, even if it’s just one or two people, it’s a deeply moving experience.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIt just has so many advantages, it’s a no brainer! +\n +\n\nGiving it back to the community #3: contribute by proxy\n\n+\n\n+\nIf you are working for a company, wanting to see particular features/integrations in Jenkins but don’t have time to do it yourself, there’s yet another way, and that’s to contribute by proxy. +\n +\n\n+\nThe idea is that you contract with those who already know how to develop Jenkins plugins, and you have them produce/improve Jenkins plugins in open-source. https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Praqma[Praqma] is a great example of one such company. They are well connected in the community, with lots of experience under their belts, and your company takes the credit for the work. There are also a number of individuals who can do this for you. +\n +\n\n+\nWhy give it away something for free when you paid for it, you might ask. That’s because the code sitting in house rots when it’s not maintained by anybody. In contrast, when the rest of the world can hack on your code, you get occasional random bug fixes by strangers (the worst case), and sometimes it gets its own life (the best case.) +\n +\n\n+\nIf this way of giving back suits you better, feel free to send an e-mail to https://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html[the dev list].","title":"Giving Back to the Community:  3 Ways to Keep Jenkins Growing","tags":["development","core","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b63c9676-c7c0-58bd-b661-26cc6f952ad1","slug":"/blog/2013/04/30/registration-and-call-for-papers-open-for-juc-palo-alto/","strippedHtml":"This year, the West Coast Jenkins User Conference will be in Palo Alto rather than San Francisco.

Zaytsev and Abigail Morrison.

Scientists are arguably even worse off: most of them are not trained as software engineers, yet, in the last decades, creating custom software has become an integral part of virtually any research activity, be it data analysis, simulation or experiments. Frequently, there is a great emphasis on numerical accuracy and reproducibility of results, which requires extensive testing. As a coup de grâce, most publicly funded research projects are running on tight budgets, excluding the possibility of hiring professional contractors to outsource required software development work. +\n +\n\n+\nEnter Jenkins the Butler! +\n +\n\n+\nBack in 2011, Yury V. Zaytsev, a doctoral candidate now working at Jülich Research Center, Germany was supported by a Google Summer of Code stipend to design a continuous integration infrastructure for http://www.nest-initiative.org[NEST], a spiking neuronal network simulator for neuroscientific research released under the GPL license. An overwhelmingly positive experience with this new setup motivated him to write up https://www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/10.3389/fninf.2012.00031/abstract[a case study], which was recently published in \"Frontiers in Neuroinformatics\", an open access scientific journal. +\n +\n\n+\n\"The new CI system boosts our productivity, because it helps us find and fix breakages very quickly, even when they only occur for obscure combinations of configuration options. Automated integration testing is a major breakthrough for NEST, as it ensures that developing new features does not come at the cost of reliability or accuracy\" - said Markus Diesmann, director of the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6) at the Jülich Research Center, Germany and NEST Initiative board member. +\n +\n\n+\nWe hope that through a peer-reviewed publication in a prominent scientific journal we will be able to reach the scientific community more efficiently, as compared to the materials targeting professional software developers. However, we likewise believe that our case study might be of interest to the readers of this blog, especially those who are still only considering implementing continuous integration. +\n +\n\n+\nLastly, we would like to thank all developers and users of Jenkins whose contributions throughout the years made it the versatile and robust continuous integration server it is today!","title":"Neuroscientists embrace continuous integration served by Jenkins","tags":["general","guest post","cia"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d3f50617-8e9b-5a69-9de7-800672ba931d","slug":"/blog/2013/03/12/coming-to-gdc-join-us-for-a-jenkins-drink-up-at-21st-amendment/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution[image:http://www.nationalreview.com/sites/default/files/nfs/uploaded/u23105/2012/12/amendment%2021%202.jpeg[image]] +\n\n+\n +\nIf you are coming to https://www.gdconf.com/[Game Developers Conference] in the week of 25th, or if you are local to San Francisco bay area, come join us to the small drink up in the evening of 26th at http://21st-amendment.com/[21st amendment]. +\n +\n\n+\nIf you are coming, https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/108919962/[please RSVP] so that we know how many to expect, and we can stay connected.","title":"Coming to GDC?
