More than half of the total votes were from ineligible voters, but the result would have been the same either way. The final result of all eligible votes is as follows: 214 votes to rename, and 14 for the status quo. You can see the individual votes hudson-jenkins-vote.\nSo what does this mean now? Well, it means Jenkins lives. We’ve registered jenkins-ci.org, though it’s empty at the moment. In the coming days, we will be renaming the existing Google Groups to jenkins-*@googlegroups.com, renaming the Twitter account from @hudsonci to @jenkinsci, and renaming our organization at Github from hudson to jenkinsci. I wanted to make sure everyone had notice ahead of time that this was happening, so that no one gets surprised by changes to their incoming mail, etc. As said before, the initial, interim governance board will consist of me, Kohsuke and, if he and Oracle are willing, Winston. If Winston is unwilling or unable to continue in that role with Jenkins, we will select a replacement interim member. The interim board will work on the details of a more permanent governance process going forward. Discussions on the infrastructure changes (including things like the Maven groupId/artifactIds, etc) will be in public, on these lists. We’re working to get the JIRA and wiki contents migrated over to the Jenkins site, and hope to work with Oracle to get that done in the next couple days.\n\nPutting aside logistics, I want to personally thank everyone for voting, and especially thank everyone who voted for renaming for supporting the Jenkins project and its future. Jenkins is not Oracle’s project, nor CloudBee’s project, nor my project, nor Kohsuke’s project - it’s the community’s project, and it’s going to thrive.","title":"Jenkins!","tags":["general","core","mailing list","meta","news","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"abayer","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Andrew was a core committer to Hudson and the author of numerous plugins.</p>\n</div>","id":"abayer","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Andrew Bayer","slug":"/blog/author/abayer","twitter":"abayer"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"2adc0051-1bf2-52bc-ad26-cb71b1ca1182","slug":"/blog/2011/01/11/hudsons-future/","strippedHtml":"First, my apologies for the lack of updates on the Hudson/Oracle situation for\nthe last few weeks. While talks have been ongoing, the holidays have slowed\nthings down, and we didn’t want to send out information that would later turn\nout not to be true. We’ve been waiting for the talks to reach a resolution -\nand I believe they now have.\n\nSince the java.net migration problems, Oracle and representatives from the\nHudson community have been involved in talks on the future of the project in a\nnumber of areas. The Hudson representatives have been myself, Kohsuke\nKawaguchi, and Sacha Labourey (CEO of CloudBees and Kohsuke’s boss), who was\nbrought in to help provide experience with discussions on a corporate/executive\nlevel which neither Kohsuke nor I have, with Alan Harder and R. Tyler Croy\nadvising on the side.\n\nThese talks have in many ways been fruitful - we came to working agreements\nwith Oracle on the project infrastructure (such as mailing lists and SCM\nrepository location), code review policy for Hudson core, and perhaps most\nsignificantly, a governance structure for the project going forward. Some\nissues are not yet entirely resolved, such as questions on restrictions on\nthird party dependency licenses. But one issue, which we feel is the most\nsignificant issue of all, one for which we now believe no resolution is\npossible: the rights to the name Hudson.\n\nOracle has told us that they have trademark applications filed in both the EU\nand US for Hudson, based on Hudson’s creation by Kohsuke while working at Sun.\nThe problem is that this trademark ownership gives Oracle the ability to revoke\nthe Hudson project’s right to call itself Hudson at any time, and while Oracle\nhas made an attempt to offer some guarantees (most notably, that binary\nreleases of Hudson, once they’ve been released with the name Hudson attached,\nwill always retain the right to the name), they are not offering any binding\nguarantee that the Hudson project will be able to retain its use of the name in\nperpetuity.\n\nTherefore, to continue using the name Hudson means ceding some of the project’s\nindependence to Oracle - if the project and its governance board opted to go in\na direction Oracle disapproved of, Oracle would be able to take away the naming\nrights. Or, in a less dramatic scenario, Oracle could insist on certain changes\nto the code, infrastructure decisions, process, etc, regardless of opposition\nfrom the Hudson development community, in order to retain the rights to the\nname.\n\nIn short, we’d be living under a sword of Damocles, regardless of the goodwill\nof the individuals we’ve been negotiating with at Oracle - Hudson as a project\nwould be beholden to Oracle’s whims for its continued use of its own name, and\nwe believe that’s not viable.\nAs I see it, the only viable option facing the project now is to rename it, in\norder to free it from the burden of Oracle’s ownership of its name. This is not\na first choice, not by a long shot, but I don’t see any other choice available\nto us that would preserve the integrity of the project going forward. Oracle\nwill be presenting their proposal for the project continuing under their\numbrella - I encourage you to read it when it becomes available and weigh it\naccordingly. I’ll just focus on what Kohsuke, other prominent Hudson community\nmembers and I have endorsed.\n\nThe Proposal\n\nFirst, we rename the project - the choice for a new name is Jenkins, which we\nthink evokes the same sort of English butler feel as Hudson. We’ve already\nregistered domains, Twitter users, etc for the new name, and have done our best\nto verify that there are no existing trademarks which would conflict with it.\nKohsuke will be registering the trademark for Jenkins in his name, with the\nintent of transferring ownership of the trademark to the umbrella of the\nSoftware Freedom Conservancy once the Jenkins project has been admitted to it\n(which, I should add, is very much our plan, hopefully in their next round of\nnew projects in a few months - we’ve already had preliminary contacts with\nSFC). We still invite Oracle to remain involved with the project, on equal\nterms with all other contributors, and hope they’ll take us up on this\ninvitation.\n\nSecond, out of respect for Oracle’s trademark claim on Hudson, we will move our\ninfrastructure off of Oracle-owned and hosted servers, and we will rename\nexisting independent components of the infrastructure to no longer use \"Hudson\"\n\ni.e., mailing lists, Github repos, etc. This would be a gradual process,\nobviously.\n\nThird, we will put in place an interim governance board for the project,\nconsisting of three members - myself, Kohsuke and, if Oracle elects to remain\ninvolved, Winston Prakash, the Oracle engineer working on Hudson. The interim\nboard members will serve for the next 3-6 months, until the governance\nstructure can be nailed down securely enough to hold elections for the board\nmembers.\n\nObviously, such a move could not be undertaken without the agreement and\nsupport of the Hudson community. We believe this proposal is the best choice\nfor the project in the situation it’s currently in, but we aren’t closing off\ndiscussion, questions, etc, and we encourage your feedback and comments. If\nthere’s anything you need clarified, please ask and we’ll do our best to\nanswer.\n\nOnce Oracle’s proposal is available later this week (hopefully Wednesday,\npossibly Thursday, from what I’ve been told), which I strongly advise you all to\nread and consider, we’ll be putting up a poll to determine the position of the\ncommunity. Once that vote is done, assuming the consensus is to rename, we’ll\nput the mechanisms in motion and switch over as fast we can.\n\nThere may be some confusion as to whether we’re proposing to fork Hudson, or\nrename the existing project. I firmly believe we are proposing the latter - for\nme, the project’s key component is Kohsuke himself. If the community decides to\nsupport renaming the project to Jenkins, and Oracle chooses to continue\ndevelopment themselves under the name Hudson, they are, obviously, entirely\nwelcome to do so. But with Kohsuke working on Jenkins, that’s the true home and\nthe future of the project for me, regardless of the name.","title":"Hudson's future","tags":["general","core","meta","news","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"abayer","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Andrew was a core committer to Hudson and the author of numerous plugins.</p>\n</div>","id":"abayer","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Andrew Bayer","slug":"/blog/author/abayer","twitter":"abayer"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d0d58bd3-e6a3-5580-8a1e-b6ac8bd2e732","slug":"/blog/2011/01/08/installing-plugins-has-always-been-easy-now-its-fast-too/","strippedHtml":"As one of the \"men behind the scenes\" of the Hudson project, a lot of my contributions tend to be in writing articles or handling infrastructure, anything to ensure folks like Kohsuke can continue to make Hudson great without being distracted by inane system administration tasks. This past week, one of my long-running infrastructure projects has finally \"gone live,\" making downloads of plugins and packages faster than ever!\n\nSome number of months ago I became frustrated with the download speeds reported by our international users, while the majority of Hudson’s infrastructure is all colocated inside of the United States, there is a huge number of Hudson users and developers who are both in Europe and Asia.\n\nAfter discussing things with some of the folks that run download.opensuse.org, a MirrorBrain powered redirector, I set out to build something similar. A mirroring network which could be easily managed and help direct users' downloads to the geographically closest and fastest mirror available.\n\nWhere are we mirrored?\n\nCurrently we have mirrors in a few locations within the United States, and one overseas:\n\nSouthwest U.S. (Utah) - Thanks to XMission\n\nMidwest U.S. (Chicago) - Thanks to the OSUOSL\n\nNortheast U.S. (New York City) - Thanks to the OSUOSL\n\nGermany - Thanks to aragost Trifork ag\n\nUsing the mirrors\n\nIf you’ve updated or installed plugins from within Hudson lately, guess what! You’re already using mirrors! In fact, since we flipped the switch on January 7th, over 800 plugins and 600 hudson.war updates have been downloaded from the mirroring network!\nIf you’d like to download directly from the mirrors, you can browse on over to mirrors.hudson-labs.org, which will redirect your request for specific files to the appropriate mirror based on your IP address. It’s just that easy!\n\nWe are currently working with more providers to add additional mirrors, hopefully we’ll have an Asian mirror online within the next two weeks and if we’re lucky, we’ll find some more European mirrors too.\n\nI would like to thank the immensely helpful and supportive engineers over at the OSUOSL for offering gratis tech support, suggestions, and bandwidth to serve as our primary mirror.","title":"Installing plugins has always been easy, now it's fast too!","tags":["general","core","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

As I covered\nyesterday there is some\nbubbling frustration within the developer community regarding some project\ninfrastructure decisions and Oracle’s reactions to them. If you can’t spare the\ntime to read that novel of a blog post, the extremely shortened version is: devs want to\nmove codebase to GitHub, Oracle disagrees and claims to have final say (hijinks\nensue).\n\nWhile there is still a lot unresolved, several of the core contributors are\ndebating and weighing our options for moving forward in a way that best\nsuits Hudson both as a project and community. In the next couple days, Kohsuke\nor Andrew will be proposing a course of action for the community after some of\nthe options have been fully vetted. Please bear in mind that Hudson is a very big project with some fairly unique needs. We have hundreds of contributors committing either to core or the plugins, we release core once a week with plugin releases occurring to the tune of 20-40 updates a week. We’ve been pinging folks who work with various foundations and major open source projects to make sure we’re covering all our bases to make sure distractions like this don’t come up again for the foreseeable future.\n\nDue to issues with MySQL, Java, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, there is clearly a lot of anti-Oracle emotion out there right now, but I want\nto make sure that it’s clear that this is not about \"Us versus Oracle.\"\n\nOur goal isn’t to \"stick it to the man,\" that doesn’t help make Hudson any better.\n\nOur goal is to foster the kind of community that we all want to\nparticipate in, and to build and improve the best continuous integration\nserver available.\n\nStay tuned :)\n---","title":"A brief update","tags":["general","core","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

In case you haven’t been following along at home, I’ll try to catch you up as impartially as possible.\n\nThe Facts\n\n2009.06.02 : After substantial problems with Java.net infrastructure, the\ndev community discusses new infrastructure\noptions,\nincluding SourceForge, Google Code, Kenai, Berlios, GitHub, etc. Instead of\nmoving the entire project, some key components such as the\nissues.hudson-ci.org are moved off of\nJava.net. Discussions about moving source code off of Java.net and onto other hosts like\nGitHub come up almost every four months on the mailing lists, typically\ncoinciding with serious Java.net downtime or reliability issues..\n\n2010.11.01 : A discussion occurs on the developers mailing list about\nadding Winston Prakash, the Oracle engineer re-assigned to replace Kohsuke Kawaguchi (Hudson\nfounder/lead developer), as a co-owner to the Java.net project. Winston\nmentions that his question was driven by Oracle management who felt he should\n\"co-own the project.\" After a round of discussion, it’s decided by the devs\nlist that it’s acceptable and grants Winston co-ownership of the project as a\nsign of good faith from the community towards Oracle.\n\n2010.11.17 : Andrew Bayer, core contributor\nand maintainer of numerous plugins emails the users and devs list with a\nproposal to move the mailing lists off of Java.net which has had notorious\nreliability issues within the Java ecosystem and was scheduled for a series of\ndowntimes and migrations over the coming weeks. Google Groups is selected as the\nmost reasonable by the community.\n\n2010.11.19 : Hudson project is lumped into the same Java.net migration bucket as Glassfish. Emails are sent to project owners, the users and the developers list. The mail to users and developers never arrives due to the sender not being subscribed. Both project owners (Kohsuke, Winston) miss the message, leaving the Hudson community in the dark regarding the pending migration.\n\n2010.11.22 : Shortly after midnight, Jacob Robertson reports that his\nSVN credentials no longer work, Kohsuke informs the developers list that the project is\nlocked due to the migration, SVN is inaccessible and mailing lists fail shortly after that. The Hudson Java.net project\nbegins its migration from the legacy infrastructure to the newer\nJava.net infrastructure (formerly known as \"Kenai\"). A group of core Hudson\ncommunity members accelerate the move to Google Groups, pushing out\nannouncements via this\nblog and\ntwitter hoping to keep as many members in the\nloop as possible.\n\n2010.11.23 : Frustrated by the locking down of Hudson’s source code,\nwhich sees between 3-8 commits to \"core\" a day, not counting the 300+\nplugins, Kohsuke proposes moving to\nGitHub\non the new developers mailing list. The general consensus amongst the plugin\nand core developers was to go forward with moving to GitHub, no major\nobjections were raised by the developer community.\n\n2010.11.27 : After Thanksgiving, Andrew Bayer submits the \" formal\nproposal\"\nfor migrating over to GitHub, Sets a deadline of the following tuesday\n(2010.11.30) for raising any major objections before \"flipping the switch.\"\n\nThe Monday morning prior to the planned switchover to GitHub, Oracle Senior VP\nof Tools and Middleware Ted\nFarrell sent a\nmessage to the users list expressing concerns he had regarding the migration of\nthe Hudson codebase from Java.net to GitHub:\n\nOracle’s goal is to grow the community and make hudson stronger. You all might not be aware of this, but the actual hudson user base is very large. Much bigger than what you see on the mailing lists or in the forums. The unfortunate part of that is how many of these users do not contribute to the core, and do not participate in these discussions. They want to do that, but don’t feel like they can be heard. We want them to be heard. We need to make the hudson community a place that will welcome all the hudson users and encourage its growth and longevity. We will be announcing some changes in the upcoming weeks that we believe will foster that.\n\nFor now, however, we are going to stay on the java.net\ninfrastructure.  We believe it is important for hudson to stay\nconnected with the rest of the the java community, as well as take\nadvantage of some of the cool changes we will have coming to\njava.net.  Moving to GIT can be done while staying on java.net.  It is\nnot a requirement to move to github.\n\n…​\n\nBecause it is open source, we can’t stop anybody from forking it.  We\ndo however own the trademark to the name so you cannot use the name\noutside of the core community.  We acquired that as part of Sun.  We\nhope that everyone working on hudson today will do as they claim to\nwant, and work with us to make hudson stronger.\n\n(Ted’s message was rather long, you can read the whole\npost here)\n\nAs one might expect, Ted’s response to the thread was received with\nmixed responses ranging from general confusion to obvious frustration.\n\nLong time contributor to Hudson’s Git plugin, Nigel Magnay tried to clarify the benefits of migrating to GitHub instead of using Git on the \"new\" Java.net as succinctly as possible:\n\nJust having git support != git support on github. They work full time on providing the best community development tools; I doubt kenai could even catch up, let alone surpass what they’re doing.\n\n…​\n\nI’m confused.\n\nWhat things are you saying you will not let the Hudson developer community\ndo?\n\nI.E: Are you saying that, as the holders of the Hudson 'name', you are\nprohibiting the developer community from choosing (for ourselves) to migrate\nthe infrastructure (bug tracking / wiki)? The repositories ?\n\nSo far the response from the developers has been pretty strongly in favour\nof the migration to google groups for mail, to github for code repositories\nand collaboration, and to a self-hosted site for bug tracking and\ninformation.\n\nTed’s response to Nigel contained one of the most important nugget of\ninformation for the whole discussion nestled in the middle of the message :\n\nNigel, what I am saying is that I believe the _final decision of what to do w.r.t. infrastructure belongs to Oracle and that decision should be made according to the will of the community as it makes sense_\n\nThe part where I editorialize\n\nI readily admit, there is a lot of information to take in here, for clarification there are two distinct \"communities\" involved in Hudson:\n\ndevelopers : the hundreds of developers actively communicating on the\ndevelopers list and\ncontributing to the 300+ plugins\n\nusers : tens of thousands of individuals and companies using Hudson\neither as a straight.war file, or using the native packages provided by\nthe community\n\nThe fundamental issue here is that the developers want to make a change in\nhow they contribute to Hudson, and have made their voices heard to that end.\nFrom the users' perspective, such a change would have literally zero impact\non them, which makes Oracle’s conflation of the two sides of Hudson\nparticularly frustrating.\n\nPart of the impasse between Oracle management and the developer community lies\nin an inherent meritocracy in any large open source project, whether it be the\nLinux kernel, the Python language and runtime, or the PostgreSQL database\nserver, those that contribute carry more weight within the community\nbecause they are actively pushing things forward. On top of that, Oracle\ncontinues to cite a \"larger community\" that’s apparently larger than those\nactive committing to Hudson on a daily or weekly basis, without naming names or\nciting specific contributions.\n\nTed, and in turn, Oracle’s approach to the Hudson community seems to stem from\na systematic misunderstanding of how most (if not all) major open source\nprojects operate. Mentiong closed-door meetings between Sonatype and Oracle\nregarding \"how to make Hudson better\" do nothing to aid many developers'\nconcerns about Oracle’s commitment to Hudson as an open source project or a\ncommunity.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we are being told one thing while Oracle’s actions speak\nto another. Insisting that Hudson development remain on Java.net, after the\ndevelopment community committed to GitHub, contradicts the words promising to\nwork with the Hudson community and to help facilitate its growth. Asserting\nthat Oracle isn’t trying to exert unwelcome control over the project, while\ndoing exactly that.\n\nPersonally, I do want Oracle to continue to be involved, along with CloudBees,\nSonatype and many other companies that contribute to the ever-growing Hudson\necosystem. The involvement of a plethora of different companies only helps\nemphasize the importance of Hudson to the developer community and underline the\nvalue of Hudson as a community owned and operated project.\n\nDecember will be an interesting month, stay tuned.","title":"Who's driving this thing?","tags":["general","core","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Initially I wasn't worried — I thought it was just another java.net outage that will resolve itself in a few hours — but a little research a bit later revealed that Hudson was locked down and being https://weblogs.java.net/blog/communitymanager/archive/2010/11/03/javanet-begins-migration-collabnet-kenai-infrastructure[migrated to new java.net infrastructure]. +\n +\n\n+\nI and the whole community was quite surprised by this, as we are supposed to be \"notified as soon as we assign a date for [our] projects to move.\" But by the time the developer community noticed, the project was already locked down, repository is read-only, and mailing lists can stop functioning any time. My immediate action was to contact the folks who are doing migration to get Hudson out of this cycle of the migration, but I was told that the ship has sailed and it was too late. +\n +\n\n+\nEven worse, there's no ETA — it'll definitely take a week, but since this is a Thanksgiving weekend, it can take longer, Oracle said. +\n +\n\n+\nI find this situation plain unacceptable, and https://java.net/projects/jersey/lists/dev/archive/2010-11/message/3[e-mails from the earlier migration effort] made me doubt if the new infrastructure is any better. I also had a pleasure of working closely with CollabNet folks over the past years and I was also involved in some earlier conversation and experiments about the new java.net infrastructure, and when it comes to performance and monitoring, CollabNet folks really knew what they are doing. So I had multiple reasons to worry if the new infrastructure can handle the load of java.net, which the old CollabNet-hosted one couldn't handle. +\n +\n\n+\nBut fortunately, since the general java.net migration has been announced, we've https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Mailing-list-change-proposal-td3047548.html[discussed] the migration of some of the project infrastructure. So we've accelerated the plan and implemented it, so as not to lose the critical project infrastructure services. +\n +\n +\n\nMailing Lists\n\n+\n\n+\nHudson mailing lists are moved to Google Groups. See https://hudson-labs.org/content/mailing-lists[more details here] and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Mailing%20List[here]. The new mailing lists provide a real search capability, decent UI for archives, and it makes it easier for people with multiple e-mail addresses to post from multiple addresses and receive just one copy. The stability of the service is also much better. +\n +\n\nSource code\n\n+\n\n+\nHudson core source code has been long synced to GitHub. We've been getting several contributions through that already, and people have been asking https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/On-the-future-of-Hudson-hosting-and-infrastructure-td393278i20.html[for] https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Git-repository-for-Hudson-td394409.html#a394412[Git] https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/hudson-plugins-git-repository-td1477941.html[migration] https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Hudson-on-github-td2252960.html[for] https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Expose-the-Hudson-SVN-as-a-GIT-repository-td391333.html[long] https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/version-control-for-hudson-source-bidirectional-git-lt-gt-svn-td978706.html[time] anyway. So going forward I'll be committing to and producing releases from https://github.com/hudson/hudson[the Hudson repository on GitHub] at `+https://kohsuke@github.com/hudson/hudson.git+`. +\n +\n\n+\nThe new Git-based repository would be far snappier to work with, and it'll make it easier for people to maintain private changes and contribute changes back. There's also a work in progress to set up Gerrit to streamline the patch review process to the core. So I think this further reduces the barrier of entry to the Hudson project and accelerate the progress. +\n +\n\n+\nThe migration of Hudson plugin repositories still needs to be discussed, so stay tuned for the updates in https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev[the dev list] today or tomorrow. I've developed a bulk import program whose output can be seen https://github.com/HudsonLabs[here], so I'm going to propose this as the migration strategy. +\n +\n +\n\nConclusions\n\n+\n\n+\nMy apologies that these changes had to happen quickly — I'm just as frustrated as you are, but given the circumstances, I think this is the best course of action. Hopefully everything will be in place within a few days. And in the mean time, thanks for your patience. +","title":"Java.net migration status update","tags":["infrastructure","core"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3f0eefca-2731-5b8f-bd42-5ab978ea40ec","slug":"/blog/2010/11/23/new-hudson-mailing-lists/","strippedHtml":"As Kohsuke mentioned in this post, the Java.net migration has caught just about everybody off-guard in the Hudson community.\n\nThe tools we use hosted by Java.net are essentially locked from us until further notice (no ETA on the migration) which is, as you might imagine frustrating both for the core developers but hundreds of plugin developers that make Hudson the best damned CI server on the planet.\n\nFor source code we’re working on getting something in place for contributions on GitHub thanks to some assistance from the GitHub team.\n\nFor mailing lists we’ve gone ahead and dumped Java.net mailing lists in favor of a collection of Google Groups:\n\nhudson-dev\n\nhudson-users\n\nhudson-commits\n\nhudson-issues\n\nContrary to popular belief, you do not need a Google account to subscribe to these lists, else we wouldn’t have chosen Google Groups. All you need to do is send an email to \" hudson-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com\" and you’ll receive a confirmation email from the mailing list server shortly.\n\nSince our issues.hudson-ci.org isn’t actually hosted on Java.net, but rather on a machine provided by Oracle, they should continue to function as per usual. The login for the systems is somewhat tied to Java.net so I am honestly not sure how stable they will be this week.\n\nI apologize sincerely for the confusion and frustration, you can trust that we’re likely ten-times more frustrated with this situation right now.\n---","title":"New Hudson Mailing Lists!","tags":["general","mailing list","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
