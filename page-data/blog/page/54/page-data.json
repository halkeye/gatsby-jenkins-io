There’s also an online service available, with some limitations.\nFor the purpose of this article, we’ll use the Chrome extension.\n\nIn the main area, you can create your request, define the URL to call, specify the various request headers or params,\nchose the method you want to use, and then, you can click the send button to issue the request.\n\nIn the left pane, that’s where you’ll be able to see your request history, create and save your project in the cloud,\nor also set context variables.\n\nThe latter is important when testing your Web API, as you’ll be able to insert variables like for example\n{localhost} for testing locally on your machine or {staging} and {prod} to run your tests in different environments.\n\nIn the bottom pane, you have access to actual raw HTTP exchange, as well as the assertions pane.\n\nAgain, a very important pane to look at! With assertions, you’ll be able to ensure that your Web API works as expected.\nFor instance, you can check the status code of the call, check the payload contains a certain element,\nby using JSON Path or XPath to go through the JSON or XML payload respectively.\n\nBeyond assertions, what’s also interesting is that you can chain requests together.\nA call request can depend on the outcome of a previous request!\nFor example, in a new request, you could pass a query parameter whose value would be the value of some element\nof the JSON payload of a previously executed request.\nAnd by combining assertions, linked requests and context variables together, you can create full-blown test scenarios,\nthat you can then save in the cloud, but also export as a JSON file.\n\nTo export that test scenario, you can click on the little export icon in the bottom left hand corner,\nand you’ll be able to select exactly what you want to export:\n\nRunning your Web API tests with Maven\n\nNow things become even more interesting, as we’ll proceed to using Maven and Jenkins!\nAs the saying goes, there’s a Maven plugin for that! For running those Web API tests in your build!\nEven if your Web API is developed in another technology than Java, you can still create a small Maven build\njust for your Web API tests.\nAnd the icing on the cake, when you configure Jenkins to run this build, as the plugin outputs JUnit-friendly test reports,\nyou’ll be able to see the details of your successful and failed tests, just like you would see JUnit’s!\n\nLet’s sketch your Maven POM:\n\n4.0.0\n\ncom.example\nmy-first-api-test\n1.2.3\n\ncom.restlet.dhc\ndhc-maven-plugin\n1.1\n\ntest\n\ntest\n\ncompanies-scenario.json\n\nrestlet-maven\nRestlet public Maven repository Release Repository\nhttps://maven.restlet.com\n\nVisualizing Web API test executions in Jenkins\n\nOnce you’ve configured your Jenkins server to launch the test goal of this Maven project,\nyou’ll be able to see nice test reports for your Web API scenarios, like in the screenshot in introduction of this article!\n\nNext, you can easily run your Web API tests when developers commit changes to the API,\nor schedule regular builds with Jenkins to monitor an online Web API.\n\nFor more information, be sure to read the tutorial on\ntesting Web APIs with DHC.\nThere are also some more resources like a\nscreencast,\nas well as the\nuser guide, if you want to learn more.\nAnd above all, happy testing!","title":"Run Your API Tests Continuously with Jenkins and DHC","tags":["development","webapis","testing"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"https://glaforge.appspot.com/","github":"glaforge","html":"","id":"glaforge","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Guillaume Laforge","slug":"/blog/authors/glaforge","twitter":"glaforge"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","id":"e79f0919-bcdb-509d-81fc-767eb7210b3a","slug":"/blog/2016/04/07/2.0-release-candidate/","strippedHtml":"Those who fervently watch the\njenkinsci-dev@\nlist, like I do, may have caught Daniel\nBeck 's email today which quietly referenced a significant milestone on the\nroad to 2.0 which has been reached: the first 2.0 release\ncandidate is here!\n\nThe release candidate process, in short, is the final stabilization and testing\nperiod before the final release of Jenkins 2.0.

He also\nserves as the CloudBees Product Marketing Manager for Jenkins.\n\nLast fall CloudBees asked attendees at the Jenkins User Conference – US West\n(JUC), and other in the Jenkins community to take a survey.  Almost 250 people\ndid – and thanks to their input, we have results which provided interesting\ninsights into how Jenkins is being used.\n\nBack in 2012, at the time of the last community survey, 83% of respondents felt\nthat Jenkins was mission-critical. By 2015, the percentage saying that\nJenkins was mission-critical was 92%. Additionally, echoing the\nimportance of Jenkins, 89% of respondents said their use of Jenkins had\nincreased over the last year, while 11% said it had stayed the same. 0%\nsaid that it had decreased.\n\nThe trend in the industry over the last couple of years has been to adopt\ncontinuous delivery (CD), thus pushing automation further down the pipeline –\nfrom development all the way into production.  Jenkins being an automation\nengine applicable to any phase of the software delivery lifecycle, is readily\nsupporting this trend. Jenkins' extensible architecture and unparalleled plugin\necosystem enables integration with and orchestration of practically any tool in\nany phase of software delivery.\n\nThe trend towards adoption of CD is clearly reflected amongst the community: 59%\nof respondents are using Jenkins for continuous integration (CI), but an\nadditional 30% have extended CI into CD and are manually deploying code to\nproduction.  Finally, 11% are practicing continuous deployment – they have\nextended CI to CD and are deploying code automatically into production.\n\nAnother trend tied to the adoption of CD and DevOps is the frequent deployment\nof incremental releases to production. 26% of those respondents using continuous\ndelivery practices are deploying code at least once per day.  Another 37% are\ndeploying code at least once per week.\n\nIn keeping with the move to CD, 30% of survey takers are already using the\nrelatively new Pipeline plugin to automate their\nsoftware delivery pipelines.  Of those not using the Pipeline plugin, 79% plan\nto adopt it in the next 12 months.\n\nSurvey respondents are also using Jenkins for many different activities.  97% of\nsurvey takers use it for \"build\" – no surprise, since that is where Jenkins got\nits start - but 58% now also use it for their deployment.\n\nWhen the 2012 community survey was conducted, container technology was not as\nwell understood as it is today,  and many didn’t know what a “Docker” was. A\nshort four years later, 96% of survey respondents who use Linux containers are\nusing Docker.  Container technology has seen impressive adoption and arguably is\nrevolutionizing the way application infrastructure is delivered.  When coupled\nwith Jenkins as an automation engine, containers help accelerate software\ndelivery by providing rapid access to lightweight environments.  The Jenkins\ncommunity has recognized and embraced the power of containers by\nproviding plugins for Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nThe Jenkins improvements which survey respondents desired the most were\nquality/timely bug fixes, a better UI and more documentation/examples.\nInterestingly, Jenkins 2.0 - which is just about to officially launch,\nprovides UI improvements and the new Jenkins.io website\nprovides improved, centralized documentation.\n\nFinally, the respondents favorite Star Wars character was R2-D2, followed by\nObi-Wan and Darth Vader. Yoda and Han Solo also got a fair amount of votes. The\nvotes for Jar-Jar Binks and Jabba the Hutt left us puzzled. Notably, BB-8 had a\nwrite-in vote despite the fact the new Star Wars movie hadn’t been released yet.\n\nAs to where the community is headed, our prediction is that by the next Jenkins Community Survey:\n\nMore Jenkins users will have transitioned from just continuous\nintegration to continuous delivery with some evening practicing continuous\ndeployment\n\nPipeline plugin adoption and improvements will continue, leading to\npipeline-as-code becoming an essential solution for automating the software\n(and infrastructure) delivery process\n\nThere will be a significant increase in use of the Docker plugin to support\nelastic Jenkins infrastructure and continuous delivery of containers using\nsoftware development best practices\n\nBB-8 will be the next favorite Star Wars character! <3</p>\n\nSee you at Jenkins World, September 13-15, in Santa Clara, California!\nRegister now for the largest Jenkins event on the planet in 2016 – and get the Early Bird discount.

If you synthesize the item before the run, much of the peripheral utilization file may be wasted.\n\nThe issue can be solved by one of concurrency management plugins:\nThrottle Concurrent Builds, Lockable Resources\nor\nExclusions.\n\nTest parallelization on multiple nodes requires using of multiple projects or\nMatrix configurations, so it causes job chaining again.\n\nThese build chains can be created via\nParameterized Trigger and\nCopy Artifacts, but it complicates job management and build history investigation.\n\nHardware infrastructure is usually flaky.\nIf it fails during the build due to any reason, it’s hard to diagnose the issue and re-run the project if the issue comes from hardware.\n\nBuild Failure Analyzer allows to identify the root cause of a build failure (e.g. by build log parsing).\n\nConditional Build Step and\nFlexible Publish plugins allow altering the build flow according to the analysis results.\n\nCombination of the plugins above is possible, but it makes job configurations extremely large.\n\nTests on hardware peripherals may take much time.\nIf an infrastructure fails, we may have to restart the run from scratch.\nSo the builds should be robust against infrastructure issues including network failures and Jenkins controller restarts.\n\nTests on hardware should be reproducible, so the environment and input parameters should be controlled well.\n\nJenkins supports\ncleaning workspaces, so it can get rid of temporary files generated by previous runs.\n\nJenkins provides support of agents connected via containers (e.g.\nDocker) or VMs, which allow creating clean environments for every new run.\nIt’s important for 3rd-party tools, which may modify files outside the workspace: user home directory, temporary files, etc.\n\nThese environments still need to be connected to hardware peripherals, which may be a serious obstacle for Jenkins admins\n\nThe classic automation approaches in Jenkins are based on Free-style and Multi-configuration project types.\nLinks to various articles on this topic are collected on the\nHW/Embedded Solution page Embedded on the Jenkins website.\nTests automation on hardware peripherals has been covered in several publications by Robert Martin, Steve Harris, JL Gray, Gordon McGregor, Martin d’Anjou, and Sarah Woodall.\nThere is also a top-level overview of classic approaches made by me at JUC2015/London (a bit outdated now).\n\nOn the other hand, there is no previous publications, which would address Pipeline usage for the Embedded area.\nIn this post I want to address this use-case.\n\nPipeline as Code for test runs on hardware\n\nPipeline as Code is an approach for describing complex automation flows in software lifecycles: build, delivery, deployment, etc.\nIt is being advertised in Continuous Delivery and DevOps methodologies.\n\nIn Jenkins there are two most popular plugins:\nPipeline and Job DSL.\nJobDSL Plugin internally generates common freestyle jobs according to the script, so it’s functionality is similar to the classic approaches.\nPipeline is fundamentally different, because it provides a new engine controlling flows independently from particular nodes and workspaces.\nSo it provides a higher job description level, which was not available in Jenkins before.\n\nBelow you can find an example of Pipeline scripts, which runs tests on FPGA board. The id of this board comes from build parameters ( fpgaId). In this script we also presume that all nodes have pre-installed tools (Xilinx ISE in this case).\n\n// Run on node having my_fpga label\nnode(\"linux && ml509\") {\n  git url:\"https://github.com/oleg-nenashev/pipeline_hw_samples\"\n  sh \"make all\"\n}\n\nBut such scenario could be also implemented in a Free-style project.\nWhat would we get from Pipeline plugin?\n\nGetting added-value from Pipeline as code\n\nPipeline provides much added-value features for hardware-based tests.\nI would like to highlight the following advantages:\n\nRobustness against restarts of Jenkins controller.\n\nRobustness against network disconnects. sh() steps are based on the\nDurable Task plugin, so Jenkins can safely continue the execution flow once the node reconnects to the controller.\n\nIt’s possible to run tasks on multiple nodes without creating complex flows based on job triggers and copy artifact steps, etc. It can be achieved via combination of parallel() and node() steps.\n\nAbility to store the shared logic in standalone Pipeline libraries\n\netc.\n\nFirst two advantages allow to improve the robustness of Jenkins nodes against infrastructure failures.\nIt is critical for long-running tests on hardware.\n\nLast two advantages address the flexibility of Pipeline flows.\nThere are also plugins for freestyle projects, but they are not flexible enough.\n\nUtilizing Pipeline features\n\nThe sample Pipeline script above is very simple.\nWe would like to get some added value from Jenkins.\n\nGeneral improvements\n\nLet’s enhance the script by using several features being provided by pipeline in order to get visualization of stages, report publishing and build notifications.\n\nWe also want to minimize the time being spent on the node with the attached FPGA board.\nSo we will split the bitfile generation and further runs to two different nodes in this case: a general purpose linux node, and the node with the hardware attached.\n\nYou can find the resulting Pipeline script below:\n\n// Synthesize on any node\ndef imageId=\"\"\nnode(\"linux\") {\n  stage \"Prepare environment\"\n  git url:\"https://github.com/oleg-nenashev/pipeline_hw_samples\"\n  // Construct the bitfile image ID from commit ID\n  sh 'git rev-parse HEAD > GIT_COMMIT'\n  imageId= \"myprj-${fpgaId}-\" + readFile('GIT_COMMIT').take(6)\n\n  stage \"Synthesize project\"\n  sh \"make FPGA_TYPE=$fpgaId synthesize_for_fpga\"\n  /* We archive the bitfile before running the test, so it won't be lost it if something happens with the FPGA run stage. */\n  archive \"target/image_${fpgaId}.bit\"\n  stash includes: \"target/image_${fpgaId}.bit\", name: 'bitfile'\n}\n\n/* Run on a node with 'my_fpga' label.\nIn this example it means that the Jenkins node contains the attacked FPGA of such type.*/\nnode (\"linux && $fpgaId\") {\n  stage \"Blast bitfile\"\n  git url:\"https://github.com/oleg-nenashev/pipeline_hw_samples\"\n  def artifact='target/image_'+fpgaId+'.bit'\n  echo \"Using ${artifact}\"\n  unstash 'bitfile'\n  sh \"make FPGA_TYPE=$fpgaId impact\"\n\n  /* We run automatic tests.\n  Then we report test results from the generated JUnit report. */\n  stage \"Auto Tests\"\n  sh \"make FPGA_TYPE=$fpgaId tests\"\n  sh \"perl scripts/convertToJunit.pl --from=target/test-results/* --to=target/report_${fpgaId}.xml --classPrefix=\\\"myprj-${fpgaId}.\\\"\"\n  junit \"target/report_${fpgaId}.xml\"\n\n  stage \"Finalization\"\n  sh \"make FPGA_TYPE=$fpgaId flush_fpga\"\n  hipchatSend(\"${imageId} testing has been completed\")\n}\n\nAs you may see, the pipeline script mostly consists of various calls of command-line tools via the sh() command.\nAll EDA tools provide great CLIs, so we do not need special plugins in order to invoke common operations from Jenkins.\n\nMakefile above is a sample stuff for demo purposes.\nIt implements a set of unrelated routines merged into a single file without dependency declarations.\nNever write such makefiles.\n\nIt is possible to continue expanding the pipeline in such way.\nPipeline Examples\ncontain examples for common cases: build parallelization, code sharing between pipelines, error handling, etc.\n\nLessons learned\n\nDuring last 2 years I’ve been using Pipeline for Hardware test automation several times.\nThe first attempts were not very successful, but the ecosystem has been evolving rapidly.\nI feel Pipeline has become a really powerful tool, but there are several missing features.\nI would like to mention the following ones:\n\nShared resource management across different pipelines.\n\nRuns of a single Pipeline job can be synchronized using the concurrency parameter of the stage() step\n\nIt can be done by the incoming Pipeline integration in the\nLockable Resources plugin\n( JENKINS-30269).\n\nAnother case is integration with\nThrottle Concurrent Builds plugin, which is an effective engine for limiting the license utilization in automation infrastructures\n( JENKINS-31801).\n\nBetter support of CLI tools.\n\nEDA tools frequently need a complex environment, which should be deployed on nodes somehow.\n\nIntegration with\nCustom Tools Plugin seems to be the best option, especially in the case of multiple tool versions\n( JENKINS-30680).\n\nPipeline package manager ( JENKINS-34186)\n\nSince there is almost no plugins for EDA tools in Jenkins, developers need to implement similar tasks at multiple jobs.\n\nA common approach is to keep the shared \"functions\" in libraries.\n\nPipeline Global Library and\nPipeline Remote Loader can be used, but they do not provide features like dependency management.\n\nPipeline debugger ( JENKINS-34185)\n\nHardware test runs are very slow, so it is difficult to troubleshoot and fix issues in the Pipeline code if you have to run every build from scratch.\n\nThere are several features in Pipeline, which simplify the development, but we still need an IDE-alike implementation for complex scripts.\n\nConclusions\n\nJenkins is a powerful automation framework, which can be used in many areas.\nEven though Jenkins has no dedicated plugins for test runs on hardware, it provides many general-purpose \"building blocks\", which allow implementing almost any flow.\nThat’s why Jenkins is so popular in the hardware and embedded areas.\n\nPipeline as code can greatly simplify the implementation of complex flows in Jenkins.\nIt continues to evolve and extend support of use-cases.\nif you’re developing embedded projects, consider Pipeline as a durable, extensible and versatile means of implementing your automation.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nJenkins automation server dominates in the HW/Embedded area, but unfortunately there is not so much experience sharing for these use-cases.\nSo Jenkins community encourages everybody to share the experience in this area by writing docs and articles for Jenkins website and other resources.\n\nThis is just a a first blog post on this topic.\nI am planning to provide more examples of Pipeline usage for Embedded and Hardware tests in the future posts.\nThe next post will be about concurrency and shared resource management in Pipelines.\n\nI am also going to talk about running tests on hardware at the\nupcoming Automotive event in Stuttgart on April 26th.\nThis event is being held by\nCloudBees, but there will be several talks addressing Jenkins open-source as well.\n\nIf you want to share your experience about Jenkins usage in Hardware/Embedded areas, consider submitting a talk for the\nJenkins World conference or join/organize a\nJenkins Area Meetup in your city.\nThere is also a\nJenkins Online Meetup.\n\nLinks\n\nRelated articles and events:\n\nHW/Embedded Solution page\n\nJenkins-Based CI for Heterogeneous Hardware/Software Projects\n\nAccelerating Automotive Innovation with Continuous

The bug does not affect Jenkins 1.653 or newer, or Jenkins LTS\n1.642.4 or newer.\n\nIf you cannot upgrade, it is possible to immediately disable submission of\nusage statistics by running the following script in \"Manage Jenkins » Script Console\":\n\nhudson.model.UsageStatistics.DISABLED = true\n\nThis will immediately disable usage data submission until you restart Jenkins.\nTo make this permanent, change your Jenkins startup script so it passes a\nsystem property to the java process:\n\njava -Dhudson.model.UsageStatistics.disabled=true -jar …/jenkins.war\n\nFor information how to do this when using one of the installers/packages, see the\ninstaller/package documentation here.\n\nTo verify that usage stats submission is disabled, run the following script in\n\"Manage Jenkins » Script Console\" and confirm the result is true:\n\nprintln hudson.model.UsageStatistics.DISABLED\n\nWe have much more information about the issue and our usage statistics process\nin\nour wiki.\n\nWhile we do not consider this a security advisory, if you are a Jenkins\nadministrator we highly recommend subscribing to our\njenkinsci-advisories@\nmailing list.","title":"Important notice regarding usage statistics","tags":["general"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and, as security officer, leads the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9efc9db9-9325-5046-a1fb-6db8d9a413f3","slug":"/blog/2016/03/24/jenkins-2-beta-released/","strippedHtml":"We released the Jenkins 2.0 beta earlier today. Download it here and try it!\n\nBesides a number of bug fixes and minor improvements, the following changes are new since the last alpha preview release:\n\nRedesigned \"New Item\" page\n\nWe redesigned the \"New Item\" page. Item types now have icons to be more visually distinctive.\n\nAdditionally, item types can now define a category they belong to (such as \"Project\" or \"Folder\"). Once the complexity of the \"New Item\" page reaches a certain threshold, the item types will be grouped into categories to be easier to find. However, for now, it’s unlikely that you will see these categories, as support for this mechanism will need to be added in plugins. This is a new API in core, and we invite plugin developers to support it to make Jenkins easier to use for users with a large number of item types. It doesn’t even require raising the minimum supported Jenkins version.\n\nSeparate configuration page for tools\n\nThe length and complexity of the Configure Jenkins page once a few dozen plugins are installed made it unnecessarily difficult to use. To improve that we’re moving the tools configuration (Git, Maven, Gradle, Ant, etc.) out of that page, into the new Global Tools Configuration.\n\nUpgrade notice and plugin installer\n\nThe Pipeline plugin suite is a big part of Jenkins 2. Over the past few weeks, open-source plugins adding support for visualization (Pipeline Stage View), automatic GitHub project creation (GitHub Branch Source Plugin) and Bitbucket project creation (Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin) have been released. However, when upgrading from Jenkins 1.x, users weren’t even given any information on these features.\n\nTo address this, users upgrading from Jenkins 1.x will now be shown a banner when they first log into Jenkins as administrator, offering them to install the suite of Pipeline plugins.","title":"Jenkins 2.0 beta released","tags":["jenkins2"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and, as security officer, leads the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"6ddd387e-8f0e-561b-ac0d-a975fc5eb865","slug":"/blog/2016/03/21/vjam/","strippedHtml":"Over the past few months, I’m happy to say, the number of\nJenkins Area Meetups (JAMs) has grown\ntremendously!
