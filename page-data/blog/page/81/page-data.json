La premiére étape de cette tournée est la https://www.cloudbees.com/juc2012.cb[JUC 2012 à Paris], le 17 avril. La conférence aura lieu la veille de https://www.devoxx.com/display/FR12/Accueil[Devoxx France] dans les mêmes locaux. La date a été spécialement choisie pour que vous puissiez faire d’une pierre deux coups, ou plutôt deux confs ! +\n +\n\n+\nLes https://cloudbees-jenkins-user-confs.eventbrite.com/[inscriptions sont ouvertes]. Inscrivez-vous dès maintenant pour bénéficier de la réduction réservée au plus enthousiastes. Vous pouvez également https://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb[proposer un sujet] ou bien https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-sponsorship.cb[soutenir la conférence en tant que sponsor]. Comme il est bien connu que les Français aiment voir leurs compatriotes sur scène, j’espère que nos nombreux développeurs jenkins francophones (les meilleurs, soit dit en passant) proposeront un sujet ! +\n +\n\n+\nCette année, nous demandons une contribution pour les inscriptions (avec un tarif réduit avant le 18 février), afin de couvrir les frais d’organisation, mais nous vous offrirons en contrepartie le T-shirt officiel ainsi que des autocollants Jenkins. Si on se base sur la JUC 2011, https://jenkins-ci.org/event/jenkins-scale-10x-los-angeles[SCALE 10x], ou le link:/blog/2012/02/21/fosdem-2012-recap/[FOSDEM], ce sera une opporunité exceptionnelle pour rencontrer et discuter avec les dévelopeurs majeurs du coeur ou des plugins, ainsi que les nombreux utilisateurs prêts à partager leur expérience et à répondre à toutes vos questions. +\n +\n\n+\n\n+\nThanks to the success of https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011-session-abstracts.cb[the Jenkins User Conference last year at San Francisco] and high interest, this year we are bringing JUC to 4 cities around the world. And the first stop is https://www.cloudbees.com/juc2012.cb[JUC 2012 in Paris], on April 17. This is one day before https://www.devoxx.com/display/FR12/Accueil[Devoxx France], and in the same venue. The date is specifically chosen so that you can kill two conferences in one stone! +\n +\nRegister for JUC Paris now (https://www.cloudbees.com/juc2012.cb) and get the Early Bird discount - which is a significant reduction in the registration fee! The conference is https://cloudbees-jenkins-user-confs.eventbrite.com/[accepting registrations] as well as looking for https://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb[talk submissions] and https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-sponsorship.cb[sponsors]. I get the impression that French people like other fellow French speaking, so I hope our French-speaking plugin developers will submit talks. +\n +\n\n+\nThis year, we are charging a small amount of money in the hope of covering the expense, but we'll give out T-shirts (which were really hot last year!) as well as stickers. And if the experience at JUC 2011, https://jenkins-ci.org/event/jenkins-scale-10x-los-angeles[SCALE 10x], and link:/blog/2012/02/21/fosdem-2012-recap/[FOSDEM] was any indication, this is a great opportunity to meet and talk with plugin/core developers, and other fellow users with whom you can discuss your experience/questions. +\n +","title":"Jenkins User Conference 2012 Paris","tags":["general","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"ndeloof","html":"","id":"ndeloof","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Nicolas De Loof","slug":"blog/author/ndeloof","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","id":"521035b8-1fda-5f7d-a038-d0561f69a3f4","slug":"/blog/2012/02/02/happy-birthday-jenkins/","strippedHtml":"On February 2nd, 2011 the first release of Jenkins, version 1.396, was made available for public consumption.
