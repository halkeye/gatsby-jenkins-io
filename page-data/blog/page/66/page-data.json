Ryan Campbell took the initiative to develop the new Google Login plugin which implements the Google+ Sign-in functionality. This is the recommended solution going forward. Follow the steps https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Google+Login+Plugin[here] to configure it for your site. *Note that you DON’T need to have a Google+ social network account/profile. Any Google account can be used.* +\n +\n\n+\nIf you find yourself locked out of your Jenkins system after the old endpoint is shut down you will need to follow the steps https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Disable+security[here] to disable Jenkins security temporarily.
