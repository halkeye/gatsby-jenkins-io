Take a look here to learn more about the talks, speakers and schedules.\n\n+\n+\n\nAs always, there is a great lineup of presenters ready to share their Jenkins stories: Peter Vilim will be presenting “Proving a First Class User Experience with Jenkins” at the U.S. East JUC, and Sander Kieft’s talk is called “Automating a Big Data Platform with Jenkins” at JUC Europe. Learn more about all 2015 JUC speakers and talks here.

Will Soula is returning this year to JUC U.S. East to “chat” about “Chat Ops and Jenkins.” Lorelei McCollum is also back with two talks at JUC U.S. East called “Jenkins 101” and “Getting Groovy with Jenkins.”\n\n+\n+\n\nThis year, you will notice a few differences in the JUC agendas. JUC is now a two-day conference in the U.S. East, Europe and U.S. West locations! Also, each session is assigned a category according to its content: Continuous Delivery, Best Practices, Operations, Plugins, Case Studies/War Stories and more. This will help you decide which talks to attend. You will also notice that several talks, especially in JUC Europe, reflect the industry’s growing interest in big data and Docker.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe agendas are still being finalized for JUC Israel and JUC U.S. West. If you are interested in speaking at either of these locations, you can still send in your talk proposals. The U.S. West deadline is May 3 and the Israel deadline is May 15.\n\n+\n+\n\nJUC is such a great opportunity for the community to come together and network face-to-face. You can meet Kohsuke Kawaguchi, creator of the Jenkins project, Gene Kim, author of The Phoenix Project and DevOps expert, but you will also have the opportunity to meet Jenkins users, just like you, from all over the world. And this year, with the Jenkins project at well over 100K active installations, JUC as a whole will be the largest gathering of Jenkins users ever.\n\n+\n+\n\nEarly bird pricing for JUC U.S. East and Europe ends May 1, so REGISTER NOW to take advantage of the lower pricing.","title":"Jenkins User Conference - Agenda News","tags":["general","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/authors/hinman","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","id":"752bdfc4-4814-55c6-a0f5-62faf0805e72","slug":"/blog/2015/04/13/juc-world-tour-2015-keynote-speaker-news-and-early-bird-tickets/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/The-Phoenix-Project-border_2.png[image,width=99] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThe 2015 JUC World Tour dates are rapidly approaching.

And so the time has come once again for us to finally move on to Java7. Because of all the new language features, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/sw_WepGw0Pk[many of us the developers really wanted to move right on to Java8], but after much discussion we settled to move to Java7 first and then to Java8. +\n +\n\n+\nSo here is the plan: +\n +\n\nStarting Jenkins 1.608, we start advertising that we will be moving on to Java7, which is why you are reading this.\n\nStarting Jenkins 1.610 (2 weeks from now), we will ship so-called 51.0 class files that will only load on Java7+. This gives some more warnings to those who don’t read our blog.\n\nUnless we hear uproar from users, starting around 1.614 (6 weeks from now), core developers will start linking directly to new Java7 APIs. We will move on to servlet 3.0 at this time as well.\n\nThe current 1.596 line of LTS will remain compatible with Java6, and most likely the next LTS line will also remain compatible with Java6. So LTS users have additional 3 months before upgrading to Java7.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nJava7 has more NIO improvements that allow us to do some file I/O in more portable manner. Similarly, servlet 3.0 will help us build more interactive UI. +\n +\n\n+\nYour Jenkins controller and all the build agents need to be running on Java7+. Similarly, those who are using the Maven2 job type must also run Maven with Java7+. However, this does not prevent you from using Jenkins to build your applications that are targeted to earlier versions of Java. According to our research, most platforms people run Jenkins on has been already shipping Java7 for quite some time now. But if you have a good reason why we shouldn't force everyone to Java7, please let us know ASAP. +\n +\n\n+\nTo put this into context, https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml[Oracle will not release updates to Java7 past April 2015]. We have always recommended users to run the latest general release according to Oracle, which is currently Java8. As I said, I suspect we will be requiring Java8 pretty soon.
