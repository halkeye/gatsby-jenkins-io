Are you at JUC because you want to learn more? Has your company been pushing you to use Jenkins or to adapt a more agile build/test process using a Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration method?\n\n+\n+\n\nJenkins 101 is going to give you an introduction to Jenkins and get you started in the right direction. Many sessions may be too in-depth, too specialized, or do a deep dive too fast, and while that is good for the more intermediate Jenkins user, the beginner can get lost fast and lose interest. My session will go through the basics of Jenkins, so anyone without prior knowledge can get up and running in just a short amount of time. We will cover building/configuring jobs, design of pipelines, security of your Jenkins controller, fun groovy scripts and useful plugins to get you started. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced Jenkins user, you can always learn from how others are using Jenkins. Attend this session early on in your JUC lineup, so that you get the most out of the conference!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/01-02-1600-McCollum_0.png[image,width=149,height=180] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Lorelei McCollum, Software Engineer at IBM.

Falling back to the year 2008 I remember myself creating my first job and the feeling of enlightenment flowing through my veins :) Then it was just one script running on just one agent (node) and it was enough for that particular task. But years have passed, software systems have become more complicated and terms like «cloud», «distributed environment», «CI/CD» are not a discovery for anyone nowadays. But how can these things be connected and used by Jenkins? The detailed answer for this question will be revealed in my presentation of \"compound-cloud\" plugin at JUC Europe 2015.\n\n+\n+\n\nBefore I got to Yandex, the QA’s automation concept was the following:\n\n+\n+\n\nThe job takes 1 free agent\n\nThe job installs the system under test and tests themselves to this node\n\nThe job runs tests\n\nThe job cleans-up and returns the agent back to the pool\n\n+\n+\n\nWhen I started working for Yandex I understood that the concept of one single agent for a job is not a solution for our tasks because of one particular reason - the system under test was not able to work on a single node… This system is a Yandex MediaAd platform and it requires at least 4 separate nodes to be run on. Better - 8 nodes. Optimal - 40 nodes :)\n\n+\n+\n\nThinking about the problem, we thought we would get closer to the solution by simply using a single Jenkins agent as a launchpad for tests and for some tools which will then get some more nodes from the cloud (we already had OpenStack ready) and deploy the system inside them. Thank God we haven’t implemented this solution :)\n\n+\n+\n\nWe’ve been stopped by the following reasons:\n\n+\n+\n\nWe are lazy and want to write as little code as possible :)\n\nThere’s a JClouds plugin that can work with OpenStack. Why don’t we use it? 'Cause it provisions only 1 agent per job. But it has provisioning algorithms implemented already, and we don’t want to reimplement them…\n\nIf we create cloud instances with a separate tool, then we have to manage them separately and can’t get profit of using Jenkins’ agent management, which is also implemented already…\n\nif we do so, we also lose Jenkins’ agent features like running a script on the agent, get some reports or statistics and so on\n\nWe would also lose visibility: how many agents we have, how many are busy, how many left til we get to the cloud quota limit? We could go to OpenStack panel then, but it’s totally inconvenient…\n\n+\n+\n\nAs a result of this reasoning, the idea emerged! «We should provide an ability to either attach several agents to a job, or to allow a agent to consist of several nodes». The second way seemed to give more order in agents management and it was stated to be a final solution for our problem. We called this concept a «compound-agent». And then we coded…​\n\n+\n+\n\nThat’s how the compound-cloud plugin was born. It allows us to get such compound-agents from any cloud plugin installed to Jenkins. Of course there’s also a possibility to form a compound agent from single agents already attached to Jenkins, but it’s not the true way for hardcore IT guys ;)\n\n+\n+\n\nOf course there are lots of details on how we use this concept in a real life for our purposes (and I will surely describe the main parts of them in my speech), but here’s a short list of common use-cases:\n\n+\n+\n\nWe configure a set of labels via the JClouds plugin. Each label represents 1 agent template, like «small_ubuntu_server» or «large_win_server».\n\nWe then configure a compound-agent label via compound-сloud plugin. Each label is a set of single cloud labels. As a result we have a label like «Small test env» consisting of \"1x large WinServer + 3x small Ubuntu».\n\nWe assign roles to each single node in a compound label, to be able to distinguish them, so the job can run a script on a particular node inside a compound-agent for example.\n\nWe assign a label to a job, like it’s done for a JClouds label, for example.\n\nWhen the job starts, a compound-agent provisions from the cloud using the corresponding compound label.\n\nWe run a deployment tool on a ROOT role node of a compound-agent. It then deploys the system under test to other nodes inside this compound-agent.\n\nWe run tests.\n\nWe don’t bother with creating/cleaning/stopping/deleting agents. It’s done by Jenkins.\n\nWe get profit :)\n\n+\n+\n\nThe core feature is that we’ve reused all the provisioning and management mechanisms already implemented in Jenkins and cloud plugins. We just run our jobs and don’t care about the distributed infrastructure!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/Denis-Chernilevskiy_0.jpg[image,width=150] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Denis Chernilevskiy, the head of QA/DevOps Services at Yandex.

Will Soula is returning this year to JUC U.S. East to “chat” about “Chat Ops and Jenkins.” Lorelei McCollum is also back with two talks at JUC U.S. East called “Jenkins 101” and “Getting Groovy with Jenkins.”\n\n+\n+\n\nThis year, you will notice a few differences in the JUC agendas. JUC is now a two-day conference in the U.S. East, Europe and U.S. West locations! Also, each session is assigned a category according to its content: Continuous Delivery, Best Practices, Operations, Plugins, Case Studies/War Stories and more. This will help you decide which talks to attend. You will also notice that several talks, especially in JUC Europe, reflect the industry’s growing interest in big data and Docker.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe agendas are still being finalized for JUC Israel and JUC U.S. West. If you are interested in speaking at either of these locations, you can still send in your talk proposals. The U.S. West deadline is May 3 and the Israel deadline is May 15.\n\n+\n+\n\nJUC is such a great opportunity for the community to come together and network face-to-face. You can meet Kohsuke Kawaguchi, creator of the Jenkins project, Gene Kim, author of The Phoenix Project and DevOps expert, but you will also have the opportunity to meet Jenkins users, just like you, from all over the world. And this year, with the Jenkins project at well over 100K active installations, JUC as a whole will be the largest gathering of Jenkins users ever.\n\n+\n+\n\nEarly bird pricing for JUC U.S. East and Europe ends May 1, so REGISTER NOW to take advantage of the lower pricing.","title":"Jenkins User Conference - Agenda News","tags":["general","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/authors/hinman","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","id":"752bdfc4-4814-55c6-a0f5-62faf0805e72","slug":"/blog/2015/04/13/juc-world-tour-2015-keynote-speaker-news-and-early-bird-tickets/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/The-Phoenix-Project-border_2.png[image,width=99] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThe 2015 JUC World Tour dates are rapidly approaching.

Because of all the new language features, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/sw_WepGw0Pk[many of us the developers really wanted to move right on to Java8], but after much discussion we settled to move to Java7 first and then to Java8. +\n +\n\n+\nSo here is the plan: +\n +\n\nStarting Jenkins 1.608, we start advertising that we will be moving on to Java7, which is why you are reading this.\n\nStarting Jenkins 1.610 (2 weeks from now), we will ship so-called 51.0 class files that will only load on Java7+. This gives some more warnings to those who don’t read our blog.\n\nUnless we hear uproar from users, starting around 1.614 (6 weeks from now), core developers will start linking directly to new Java7 APIs. We will move on to servlet 3.0 at this time as well.\n\nThe current 1.596 line of LTS will remain compatible with Java6, and most likely the next LTS line will also remain compatible with Java6. So LTS users have additional 3 months before upgrading to Java7.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nJava7 has more NIO improvements that allow us to do some file I/O in more portable manner. Similarly, servlet 3.0 will help us build more interactive UI. +\n +\n\n+\nYour Jenkins controller and all the build agents need to be running on Java7+. Similarly, those who are using the Maven2 job type must also run Maven with Java7+. However, this does not prevent you from using Jenkins to build your applications that are targeted to earlier versions of Java. According to our research, most platforms people run Jenkins on has been already shipping Java7 for quite some time now. But if you have a good reason why we shouldn't force everyone to Java7, please let us know ASAP. +\n +\n\n+\nTo put this into context, https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml[Oracle will not release updates to Java7 past April 2015].
