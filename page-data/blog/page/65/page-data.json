The goal is to make Confluence upgrade more manageable and testable. In the proces, I've not only containerized Confluence, but also containerized https://github.com/jenkins-infra/confluence-cache[some other services], including https://github.com/jenkins-infra/mock-ldap[mock LDAP server], to be able to test the copy of the production Confluence dataset against newer versions of Confluence before upgrading production. +\n +\n\n+\nThe infra team is currently http://lists.jenkins-ci.org/pipermail/jenkins-infra/2015-April/000292.html[targeting this weekend] to migrate our current Confluence instance to this new container, and use the opportunity to move the service to a bigger system. Currently JIRA and Confluence has to live within 2.5GB RAM from the same host, and it's really stretching both services. The new box has 4GB of RAM, and we are splitting JIRA and Confluence to two different servers. So there's a lot of head room. +\n +\n\n+\nSo please expect some Wiki outage over the next weekend. +\n +\n\n+\nAs always, our sincere thank you to https://osuosl.org/[Oregon State University Open Source Lab] for generously hosting our servers.

And so the time has come once again for us to finally move on to Java7. Because of all the new language features, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/sw_WepGw0Pk[many of us the developers really wanted to move right on to Java8], but after much discussion we settled to move to Java7 first and then to Java8. +\n +\n\n+\nSo here is the plan: +\n +\n\nStarting Jenkins 1.608, we start advertising that we will be moving on to Java7, which is why you are reading this.\n\nStarting Jenkins 1.610 (2 weeks from now), we will ship so-called 51.0 class files that will only load on Java7+. This gives some more warnings to those who don’t read our blog.\n\nUnless we hear uproar from users, starting around 1.614 (6 weeks from now), core developers will start linking directly to new Java7 APIs. We will move on to servlet 3.0 at this time as well.\n\nThe current 1.596 line of LTS will remain compatible with Java6, and most likely the next LTS line will also remain compatible with Java6. So LTS users have additional 3 months before upgrading to Java7.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nJava7 has more NIO improvements that allow us to do some file I/O in more portable manner. Similarly, servlet 3.0 will help us build more interactive UI. +\n +\n\n+\nYour Jenkins controller and all the build agents need to be running on Java7+. Similarly, those who are using the Maven2 job type must also run Maven with Java7+. However, this does not prevent you from using Jenkins to build your applications that are targeted to earlier versions of Java. According to our research, most platforms people run Jenkins on has been already shipping Java7 for quite some time now. But if you have a good reason why we shouldn't force everyone to Java7, please let us know ASAP. +\n +\n\n+\nTo put this into context, https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml[Oracle will not release updates to Java7 past April 2015]. We have always recommended users to run the latest general release according to Oracle, which is currently Java8. As I said, I suspect we will be requiring Java8 pretty soon. So if you are still running Java6, you should definitely upgrade to Java8. +","title":"Good bye Java6","tags":["development","core","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"0032620d-d2e2-5b0c-abbb-713b204b7bd9","slug":"/blog/2015/03/25/registration-for-juc-2015-is-open/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bqbz9JQIIAA9gKG.jpg[image,width=300,height=225] +\n\n+\n+\n\nIt’s that time of the year again: 2015 Jenkins User Conference Registration is OPEN for all cities.

Ryan Campbell took the initiative to develop the new Google Login plugin which implements the Google+ Sign-in functionality. This is the recommended solution going forward.
