Just like other events this year, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that doesn’t mean there is a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There will be over 50 Jenkins/open source sessions and opportunities to virtually connect with over 20,000+ attendees on the event platform. Below are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :\n\nJenkins: Where It Is and Where It is Going\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 7:00 a.m.-7:30 a.m (PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Oleg Nenashev\n\nJenkins keeps evolving to address demands from its users and contributors: configuration as code, better support of cloud-native technologies, etc. Recently, we have introduced a public roadmap for the project, and there are many key initiatives in development and preview phases. This session will cover the current state of Jenkins and what’s next for the project.\n\nManaging DevSecOps Pipelines at Scale with Jenkins Templating Engine\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 11:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. (PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Steven Terrana\n\nAre you currently helping build or maintain a Jenkins pipeline for more than one application or team? Are you tired of copying and pasting Jenkinsfiles and tweaking them to fit each team’s specific needs? This session will feature a live demonstration of getting up and running with the Jenkins Templating Engine (JTE). Attendees will learn how to stop creating bespoke pipelines on a per-application basis and, instead, create tool-agnostic pipeline templates that multiple teams can inherit - regardless of tech stack.\n\neBay’s Journey Building CI at Scale\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 12:30 p.m.-1:00 p.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeakers: Ravi Kiran Rao Bukka & Vasumathy Seenuvasan\n\nA scalable CI platform with 6,000+ Jenkins instances serving around 43,000 builds per day on multi-cluster Kubernetes. A system built with metrics, key resource tuning, remediation’s and security in place. Join this session to hear from eBay on their journey of best practices and learnings about open source.\n\nMachine Learning Plugins for Data Science in Jenkins\n\nDate: Wednesday, September 23, 11:00 a.m.-11:15 a.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Loghi Perinpanayagam\n\nMachine Learning has evolved rapidly in the software industry for recent years. Jenkins CI/CD can be a good practice to deliver a high reliable product in the end. We have done an initial startup on this plugin that can be used to build Jupyter Notebooks, Python files and JSON files in Zeppelin format. In addition, the build wrappers could be used to convert Jupyter Notebooks to Python/JSON and/or copy the files to the workspace for more actions.  This Machine Learning plugin will endeavor to satisfy the data science community together with the help of other plugins. Success of this plugin will definitely serve much benefits to the community and Jenkins.\n\nJenkins UI Gets a Makeover\n\nDate: Thursday, September 24, 7:30 a.m.-8:00 a.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeakers: Felix Queiruga & Jeremy Hartley\n\nAn overview of the Jenkins UI overhaul. We are taking an iterative approach to gradually refresh the Jenkins UI. This approach will make Jenkins look fresh and modern, without changing the way users are accustomed to working with Jenkins or require plugins to be rewritten to render properly in the new Jenkins UI. Join this session to learn the changes we’ve made and how you can help to improve the Jenkins UI.\n\nThe event is free to everyone and recordings will be available on-demand. Registration is required to access the on-demand recordings. And don’t forget to visit the CDF booth in the expo hall for one on one Q&A’s with Jenkins experts.","title":"Jenkins at DevOps World

article describes our observations during Windows testing of the Jenkins 2.249.1 release candidate.\n\nUpgrade testing\n\nJenkins 2.249.1 is a new long term support release with user interface improvements and changes in Windows support.\nIt is the first long term support release to drop support for Microsoft.NET framework 2.0.\nThe end of support for Microsoft.NET framework 2.0 was announced in the Windows Support Updates blog post.\nThe Windows support upgrade guidelines describe major things to consider when upgrading Jenkins controllers and agents on Windows.\n\nAs part of our preparation for the release, we tested several configurations.\nThis article describes our experiences with those configurations.\n\nUpgrade approaches\n\nWe tested controller and agent upgrades from Jenkins 2.235.x to 2.249.1-rc on Windows.\nThe tests included:\n\n32 bit Windows MSI\n\n64 bit Windows MSI\n\nWAR (file) on Windows\n\nUpgrade process\n\nOur upgrade process included:\n\nInstall a previous version of Jenkins controller on Windows\n\nInstall a previous version of Jenkins agent on Windows and configure it as a service\n\nUpgrade Jenkins controller from \"Manage Jenkins\"\n\nRestart the Jenkins Windows service for the controller\n\nUpgrade the Jenkins agent on Windows with the latest agent.jar\n\nRestart the Jenkins Windows service for the agent\n\nTesting results\n\nWe successfully tested\n\nRestarting Windows service for controller ( JENKINS-63198)\n\nRestarting Windows service for agents ( JENKINS-63223)\n\nWe confirmed that we can continue our Level 1 support policy for Jenkins 2.249.1.\n\n32 bit Windows MSI\n\nPrior to Jenkins 2.235.3, the Jenkins LTS Windows installer was provided as a 32 bit MSI and included a bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\nThe Jenkins agent can be downloaded and run through Java web start using the bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\nThe agent can also be configured to run as a service using the bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\n\nJenkins controller\n\nJenkins 2.235.1 installs JRE 8u144 for 32 bit Windows.\nThe installer configures the Jenkins controller to run as the SYSTEM user.\n\nRefer to the Windows Installer Updates blog post for details of the controller installation process with the 32 bit MSI.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent starts the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent\n\nThe downloaded file needs to be opened from a command prompt using the javaws command that is included with the bundled JRE:\n\nC:\\> \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Jenkins\\jre\\bin\\javaws.exe\" -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nThe javaws program has been removed from  the most recent releases of Java 8 and from Java 11.\nRefer to [Jenkins agent and icedtea] for a technique that can help users of the most recent releases of Java 8.\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is adjusted to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nUpgrade the controller\n\nThe Jenkins controller on Windows can be upgraded to Jenkins 2.249.1 from the \"Manage Jenkins\" page.\nThe upgrade process downloads the new jenkins.war file, saves the current version in case of later downgrade, and offers to restart.\n\nUpgrade the agent\n\nThe Jenkins inbound agent is not upgraded automatically.\nThe agent administrator downloads the most recent agent.jar from their Jenkins controller, stops the running agent, and replaces the installed agent.jar with the downloaded version.\nThe agent service will reconnect to the Jenkins controller after the administrator restarts it.\n\n64 bit Windows MSI\n\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.235.3, the Jenkins LTS Windows installer is a 64 bit MSI.\nIt runs Jenkins with the 64 bit JDK (Java 8 or Java 11) selected by the user.\n\nJenkins controller\n\nJenkins 2.235.3 was installed using AdoptOpenJDK Java 8u262 in one test.\nIt was installed using AdoptOpenJDK Java 11.0.8 in another test.\nIn both cases, the installer configured the Jenkins controller to run with the Windows service account we had previously configured.\n\nRefer to the Windows Installer Updates blog post for details of the controller installation process with the 64 bit MSI.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent was started the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent with IcedTea-Web\n\nRecent versions of Java 8 and all versions of Java 11 have removed the javaws command.\nJenkins agents for Java 8 can still be started with the javaws command, but it needs to be downloaded separately from the JVM.\nWe open \"slave-agent.jnlp\" from a command prompt using the javaws command that is available from AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea :\n\nC:\\> C:\\icedtea-web-1.8.3.win.bin\\icedtea-web-image\\bin\\javaws.exe -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is installed and configured to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nUpgrading the controller\n\nThe Jenkins controller on Windows was upgraded to Jenkins 2.249.1 from the \"Manage Jenkins\" page.\nThe upgrade process downloads the new jenkins.war file, saves the current version in case of later downgrade, and offers to restart.\n\nUpgrading the agent\n\nThe Jenkins inbound agent is not upgraded automatically or from a Jenkins user interface.\nThe agent administrator downloads the most recent agent.jar from their Jenkins controller and replaces the installed agent.jar with the downloaded version.\n\nWAR (file) on Windows\n\nJenkins allows users to run the Jenkins web archive (WAR) file from a command line and then install it as a service from within Jenkins.\nThis installation technique uses the Jenkins WAR file but does not use a Windows MSI package.\nThe Jenkins WAR file includes the necessary components to install and configure Jenkins as a service.\n\nInstall controller as a service\n\nWhen the Jenkins war file is started from a Windows command prompt, \"Manage Jenkins\" includes \"Install as a service\".\nAn administrator selects that entry and Jenkins will configure itself to run as a service/\nThe installer configures the Jenkins controller to run as the SYSTEM user.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nAfter opening the Jenkins TCP port for inbound agents, we configured a new agent from the \"Nodes\" menu\nThis created an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent was started the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent with IcedTea-Web\n\nRecent versions of Java 8 and all versions of Java 11 have removed the javaws command.\nJenkins agents for Java 8 can still be started with the javaws command, but it needs to be downloaded separately from the JVM.\nOpen \"slave-agent.jnlp\" from a command prompt using the javaws command that is available from AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea-Web :\n\nC:\\> C:\\icedtea-web-1.8.3.win.bin\\icedtea-web-image\\bin\\javaws.exe -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is installed and configured to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nConclusion\n\nJenkins controller installation is best done with the new 64 bit MSI package.\nPrevious controller installations can be upgraded to the most recent Jenkins release from within Jenkins.\n\nJenkins inbound agent installation is more complicated now that the javaws.exe program is not included in the JDK.\nThe AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea-Web project allows administrators to install and configure Jenkins inbound agents with most of the ease that was available in prior Java releases.","title":"Testing Jenkins 2.249.1 on

One of the reasons it continues to be so ubiquitous is that Jenkins constantly evolves and offers flexibility to integrate other tools that work well for your solution.\n\nAt CDCon, on October 7-8, there are two particular Jenkins talks that will focus on new directions that the Jenkins platform is evolving too and getting better and better for users.\n\nHeard of JCasC and Not Sure Where to Start? Let me Help You!\n\nConfiguration as code is a best practice for your CI/CD setup as it makes the complex process of setting up Jenkins simpler and more reproducible. Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasc) enables Jenkins users to define the whole configuration as a simple, plain text YAML syntax. With JCasc, setting up a new Jenkins controller is easier than ever before. To get started with JCasC some initial effort is required. This talk walks you through a basic setup for easily spinning up new Jenkins instances.\n\nOctober 7 at 2:20 PM PST\nSpeaker: Ewelina Wilkosz, Eficode\n\nEwelina W is passionate about making sure that her customers' software is being built, tested and released in the best possible way. And, most importantly, that software developers don’t hate the process. Ewelina has been involved in Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin development from the very beginning. This is a must-see talk where Ewelina will also share some tips and tricks. The talk will feature using Docker, Jenkins and GitHub Actions as a quick way to build… Jenkins!\n\nBridging the Gap with Tekton-client-plugin for Jenkins\n\nTekton provides Kubernetes-native CI/CD building blocks. It enables users to take full advantage of cloud-native features around scalability and high availability. Jenkins flexibility enables integration with Tekton. This talk showcases the new tekton-client-plugin for Jenkins that enables Jenkins to interact with Tekton pipelines on a Kubernetes cluster. Tekton and Jenkins are both CDF projects and this talk highlights the first steps towards better Tekton and Jenkins interoperability, a key goal of the CD Foundation.\n\nOctober 7 at 11:40 AM PST\nSpeaker: Vibhav Bobade, Red Hat\n\nRegister for CDCon\n\nBoth these talks showcase the ultimate flexibility and power of the Jenkins platform and how it continues to evolve to meet the challenges of modern-day CI/CD. Don’t miss out; register for CDCon to attend.\n\nCDCon has pledged to donate 100% of the proceeds received from CDCon 2020 registration to charitable causes: Black Girls Code, Women Who Code and the CDF Diversity Fund. Registrants indicate which charitable fund they want their 25 USD registration fees to go to during registration.

Maybe it could be on a future roadmap. Therefore, we\ndecided to shift the testing to only linux agents with respect to running the tests on the jenkins\nserver.\n\nPull Request #116\n\nBackend port error message\n\nSpring boot has a default message on the port:8080 and therefore we wanted to change\nit to a custom message on the backend. So the major takeaway here is that we needed to\nimplement the Error Controller interface and include a custom message in it.\nThis was technical debt from the last phase and was completed and merged during this phase.\n\nPull Request #92\n\nPMD Analysis\n\nIn order to enhance the quality of the code, the PMD source code analyser was applied to the project.\nIt helped me catch tons of errors. When the initial PMD check was run and we found approximately 162 PMD errors. We realised some of them were not relevant and some of them could be fixed later.\n\nPull Request #102\n\nFindbugs Analysis\n\nAnother tool to improve code quality that we included in this phase was findbugs.\nIt did catch around 5-10 bugs in my code which I immediately resolved. Most of them were\naround the Closeable HTTP Request and an easy fix was the try with resources.\n\nPull Request #118\n\nJacoco Code Coverage\n\nWe needed to make sure most of the code we write had proper coverage for all branches and\nlines. Therefore we decided to include a JaCoco Code Coverage reporter that helped us find the\nuncovered lines and areas we need to improve coverage on.\n\nPull Request #103\n\nRemove JCasC generation\n\nWhile developing the service we quickly realised that the generation of the war package broke if we\nincluded a configuration as code section but did not provide a path to the corresponding required yml\nfile. Therefore we took a decision to remove the casc section all together. Maybe it will comeback in\na future patch\n\nPull Request link: #127\n\nIssue link: #65\n\nMinor Fixes\n\nLogging Fix: #99\n\nDocs Fix : link: #120\n\nUpdate Center Dump Fix : link: #125\n\nClass Path Fix: link: #126\n\nRelease Drafter Addition: link: #136\n\nFront end\n\nCommunity Config Navigation link\n\nThere was no community configuration link present for navigation which was added here.\n Now it is easier to navigate to the community page from the home page itself.\n\nPull Request #100\n\nDocker updates\n\nBuild everything with Docker\n\nThis was one of the major changes this phase with respect to making the service very easy to spin up locally, this change will greatly help community adoption since it eliminates the tools one needs to install locally. Initially the process was to run maven locally, generate all of the files and then copy all of its contents into the container. However, with this change we are going to generate all of the files inside the docker container itself. Allowing the user to just run a couple of commands to get the service up and running.\n\nSo some of the major changes we did with respect to the dockerfile was:\n\na) Copy all of the configuration files and pom.xml into the container.\n\nb) Run the command mvn clean package inside the container which generates the jar.\n\nc) Run the jar inside the container.\n\nPull Request #104\n\nHosting updates\n\nThis process was supposed to be a future roadmap, however the infra team approved and was super helpful\nin making this process as smooth as possible. Thanks to Gavin, Tim and Oblak for making this possible.\nHere is the google group dicussion\n\nThe project has now been hosted here as a preview. It still needs\nsome fixes to be fully functional.\n\nInfra Docker PR #131\n\nInfra Project Addition PR link: #393\n\nTesting Updates\n\nUnit test the services\n\nWith respect to community hosting and adoption, testing of the service one of the most important and major milestones for this phase was to test the majority of the code and we have completed the testing with flying colors. All of the services have been completely unit tested, which is a major accomplishment.\nFor the testing of the service we decided to go with wiremock which can be used to mock external services. Kezhi’s comment helped us to understand what we needed to do since he had done something quite similar in his Github Checks API project.\n\nSo we basically wiremocked the update-center url and made sure we were getting\nthe accurate response with appropriate control flow logic tested.\n\nwireMockRule.stubFor(get(urlPathMatching(\"/getUpdateCenter\"))\n                .willReturn(aResponse()\n                        .withStatus(200)\n                        .withHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n                        .withBody(updateCenterBody)));\n\nPull Request #105\n\nAdd Update Center controller tests\n\nAnother major testing change involved testing the controllers. For this we decided to use the wiremock library in java to mock the server response when the controllers were invoked.\n\nFor example: If I have a controller that serves in an api called /api/plugin/getPluginList\nwiremock can be used to stub out its response when the system is under test. So we use something like this to test it out.\n\nwhen(updateService.downloadUpdateCenterJSON()).thenReturn(util.convertPayloadToJSON(dummyUpdateBody))\n\nWhen the particular controller is called the underlying service is mocked and it returns a response according to the one provided by us. To find more details the PR is here.\n\nPull Request #106\n\nAdd Packager Controller Tests\n\nAlong with the update center controller tests another controller that needed to be tested was the\npackager controller. Also we needed to make sure that all the branches for the controllers were properly tested. Additional details can be found in the PR below.\n\nPull Request #133\n\nDocker Compose Tests\n\nOne problem that we faced the entire phase was the docker containers. We regularly found out that due to\nsome changes in the codebase the docker container build sometimes broke, or even sometimes the inner api’s seemed to malfunction. In order to counteract that we decided to come up with some tests locally.\nSo what I did was basically introduce a set of bash scripts that would do the following:\n\na) Build the container using the docker-compose command.\n\nb) Run the container.\n\nc) Test the api’s using the exposed port.\n\nd) Teardown the running containers.\n\nPull Request #131\n\nUser Documentation\n\nWe also included a user docs guide so that it makes it super easy to get started with the service.\n\nPull Request #145\n\nFuture Roadmap\n\nThis has been a super exciting project to work on and I can definitely see this project being built\nupon and extended in the future.\n\nI would like to talk about some of the features that are left to come in and can be taken up in\na future roadmap discussion\n\na) JCasC Support :\n\nDescription: Support the generation of a Jenkins Configuration as Code file asking the user interactively for the plugins they select what would be the configuration they would want eg: If the user selects the slack plugin we need to ask him questions like what is the slack channel? what is the token? etc, and on the basis of this generate a casc file. This feature was initially planned to go into the service but we realised this is a project in its own capacity.\n\nb) Auto Pull Request Creation :\n\nDescription: Allow users to create a configuration file and immediately open a pull request on github\nwithout leaving the user interface. This was originally planned using a github bot and we started the work on it. But we were in doubt if the service would be hosted or not and therefore put the development on hold.\nYou can find the pull requests here:\n\nGithub Controller #72\n\nPull Request Creation Functions #66\n\nc) Synergy with Image Controller\n\nDescription: This feature requires some planning, some of the questions we can ask are:\n\na) Can we generate the images (i.e Image Controller).\nb) Can we have the service as a multipurpose generator ?\n\nStatistics\n\nThis phase has been the busiest of all phases and it has involved a lot of work, more than I had\ninitially expected in the phase. Although lines\nof code added is not an indication of work done, however 800 lines of Code added is a real personal milestone for me.\n\nPull Requests Opened\n26\n\nLines of Code Added\n1096\n\nLines of Docs Added\n200\n\nOther links\n\nGitter Channel Link\nGSoC Proposal\nDesign Document\nDaily Notes","title":"Custom Distribution Service : Phase 3 Blogpost","tags":["service","distribution","cloud-native","gsoc","gsoc2020","packaging","platform-sig"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"sladyn98","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sladyn is a Computer Science student at Mumbai University, India.\nHe is participating in Community Bridge 2019 to provide development tools to JCasC plugin in the form of IDE integrations, schema architecture improvements and configuration extension points <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin\">Configuration as Code Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"sladyn98","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sladyn Nunes","slug":"/blog/authors/sladyn98/","twitter":"SladynN"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":"6bac69c5-68d0-5291-8064-51a2296a084b","slug":"/blog/2020/08/31/github-checks-api-plugin-coding-phase-3/","strippedHtml":"This blog post is about our phase 3 progress on GitHub Checks API Project, you can find our previous blog posts for phase 1 and phase 2.\n\nAt the end of this summer, the GSoC journey for GitHub Checks API Project comes to an end as well.\nIn this blog post, I’ll show you our works during the last month:\n\nPipeline Support\n\nRerun Request Support\n\nGit SCM Support\n\nDocumentation\n\nAll the above features will be available in our planned 1.0.0 version of Checks API Plugin and GitHub Checks Plugin.\n\nCoding Phase 3 Demo\n\nPipeline Support\n\nThe pipeline support allows users to directly publish checks in their pipeline script without depending on any other consumers.\n\nThe check in the above screenshot is published by script:\n\npublishChecks name: 'pipeline check', title: 'pipeline ', summary: '# A pipeline check example',\n        text: \"## This check is published through the pipeline script\",\n        detailsURL: 'https://ci.jenkins.io'\n\nIf you want to publish checks to GitHub, please install the GitHub implementation and refer to the GitHub API documentation for the requirements for each field.

If you’d like to skip the journey part, you can directly go to the [major performance improvements] section and the [minor performance section] to see what we’ve done!\n\nJourney to release\n\nThe project started with deciding to choose a git operation and then trying to compare the performance of that operation by using command line git and then with JGit.\n\nStage 1: Benchmark results with git fetch\n\nThe performance of git fetch (average execution time/op) is strongly correlated to the size of a repository\n\nThere exists an inflection point on the scale of repository size after which the nature of JGit performance changes (it starts to degrade)\n\nAfter running multiple benchmarks, it is safe to say that for a large sized repository command line git would be a better choice of implementation.\n\nWe can use this insight to implement a feature which avoids JGit with large repositories.\n\nStage 2: Comparing platforms\n\nThe project was also concerned that there might be important differences between operating systems.\nFor example, what if command line Git for Windows performed very differently than command line Git on Linux or FreeBSD?\nBenchmarks were run to compare fetch performance on several platforms.\n\nRunning git fetch operation for a 400 MiB sized repository on:\n\nAMD64 Microsoft Winders\n\nAMD64 FreeBSD\n\nIBM PowerPC 64 LE Ubuntu 18\n\nIBM System 390 Ubuntu 18\n\nThe result of running this experiment is given below:\n\nThe difference in performance between git and JGit remains constant across all platforms.\n\nBenchmark results on one platform are applicable to all platforms.\n\nStage 3: Performance of git fetch and repository structure\n\nThe area of the circle enclosing each parameter signifies the strength of the positive correlation between the performance of a git fetch operation and that parameter. From the diagram:\n\nSize of the aggregated objects is the dominant player in determining the execution time for a git fetch\n\nNumber of branches and Number of tags play a similar role but are strongly overshadowed by size of repository\n\nNumber of commits has a negligible effect on the performance of running git fetch\n\nAfter running these experiments from Stage-1 to Stage-3, we developed a solution called the GitToolChooser which is explained in the next stage\n\nStage 4: Faster checkout with Git tool chooser\n\nThis feature takes the responsibility of choosing the optimal implementation from the user and hands it to the plugin. It takes the decision of recommending an implementation on the basis of the size of the repository. Here is how it works.\n\nThe image above depicts the performance enhancements we have performed over the course of the GSoC project. These improvements have enabled the checkout step to be finished within half of what it used to take earlier in some cases.\n\nLet’s talk about performance improvements in two parts.\n\nMajor performance improvements\n\nBuilding Tensorflow (~800 MiB) using a Jenkins pipeline, there is over 50% reduction in overall time spent in completing a job!\nThe result is consistent multiple platforms.\n\nThe reason for such a decrease is the fact that JGit degrades in performance when we are talking about large sized repositories. Since the GitToolChooser is aware of this fact, it chooses to recommend command line git instead which saves the user some time.\n\nMinor performance improvements\n\nNote: Enable JGit before using the new performance features to let GitToolChooser work with more options → Here’s how\n\nBuilding the git plugin (~ 20 MiB) using a Jenkins pipeline, there is a drop of a second across all platforms when performance enhancement is enabled. Also, eliminating a redundant fetch reduces unnecessary load on git servers.\n\nThe reason for this change is the fact that JGit performs better than command line git for small sized repositories (<50MiB) as an already warmed up JVM favors the native Java implementation.\n\nReleases\n\nGit Plugin 4.4.0\n\nAdd GitToolChooser\n\nRemove redundant fetch\n\nGit Client Plugin 3.4.0\n\nAdd support to communicate compatibility of JGit with certain additional SCM behaviors\n\nThe road ahead\n\nSupport from other branch source plugins\n\nPlugins like the GitHub Branch Source Plugin or GitLab Branch Source Plugin need to extend an extension point provided by the git plugin to facilitate the exchange of information related to size of a remote repository hosted by the particular git provider\n\nJENKINS-63519 : GitToolChooser predicts the wrong implementation\n\nAddition of this feature to GitSCMSource\n\nDetection of lock related delays accessing the cache directories present on the controller\n\nThis issue was reported by the plugin maintainer Mark Waite, there is a need to reproduce the issue first and then find a possible solution.\n\nReaching out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions or feedback on the project’s\nGitter Channel or the\nJenkins Developer Mailing list.\nReport an issue at Jenkins Jira.\n\nUseful Links\n\nPhase 1 Blog: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/07/09/git-performance-improvement-phase1/\n\nPhase 2 Blog: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/07/29/git-performance-improvement-phase2/\n\nProject Page: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/git-plugin-performance/\n\nDemonstration","title":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement: Final Phase and Release","tags":["plugins","git","platform-sig","developer","performance","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#685848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/77b35/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/d4a57/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/68974/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/ef6ff/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/8257c/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/6766a/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/22bfc/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"rishabhBudhouliya","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2020 student under the Jenkins project (Git Plugin Performance Improvements).\nAspiring to be better at Software Development and participate more in the open source\ncommunity.</p>\n</div>","id":"rishabhbudhouliya","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rishabh Budhouliya","slug":"/blog/authors/rishabhbudhouliya/","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":"c3c50d8e-f813-526e-9f03-e29284122a65","slug":"/blog/2020/08/27/machine-learning-plugin-coding-phase3/","strippedHtml":"Good to see you all again !\n\nThis is my final blog post about coding phase 3 in Jenkins Machine Learning Plugin for GSoC 2020.\nBeing at the end of GSoC 2020, we had to finish all the pending issues and testing before a stable release in the main repository. Throughout this program, there were lots of learning and hard work will make this plugin valuable to the Data Science and Jenkins community.\n\nSummary\n\nWith combining all of the work in phase 1, 2 and 3, initial version of Machine learning plugin( 1.0 ) was successfully released in Jenkins plugin repository.\nAn interesting feature which allows users to connect to their existing programming language kernels more than connecting to only IPython kernel was introduced in this phase. It can be selected in multiple steps with different kernel.\nImages and graphs produced by Jupyter notebooks will be saved in user preferred folder in the workspace that can be used for reporting/analytic purposes later. Hoping this blog summarizes the Machine Learning’s features and future contributions. Thank you for your interest and support !!!\n\nMain features of Machine Learning plugin\n\nExecute Jupyter notebooks directly\n\nRun different language scripts using multiple build steps\n\nConvert Jupyter Notebooks to Python\n\nConfigure Jupyter kernels( IPython, IRKernel, IJulia etc) properties\n\nSupport to execute Notebooks/scripts on Agent\n\nExtract graph/map/images from the code\n\nEach build step can be associated with a machine learning task\n\nSupport for Windows and Linux\n\nFuture improvements\n\nImproving performance of the plugin\n\nTry to implement jira:JENKINS-63377[]\n\nSupport parameterized definitions in Notebooks jira:JENKINS-63478[]\n\nIncreasing testing code coverage\n\nMultiple language kernel support\n\nIf there are existing kernels in the system, user will be able to configure in the global configurations in order to apply in the builder/step configuration.\n\nSome popular interactive kernels\n\nIPython for python\n\nIRKernel for R\n\nIJulia for Julia\n\nIJavascript for javascript\n\nMore kernels and installation guides are found here. https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels\n\nDump images and graphs\n\nText output will be displayed in the console log. At the same time images/graphs/heat maps and HTMLs will be saved in the workspace. An action is shown in the left panel to display images in realtime. Due to the Content Security Policy of jenkins, some HTMLs which contain harmful javascript may not render in jenkins UI.\n\nFixed bugs\n\nThere were more bugs identified and fixed with many interactive testings. Setting the working directory of kernels was a big issue while getting datasets/files by script. Zeppelin process launcher was bypassed to fix this issue.\n\nPatch version released\n\nA major bug which was created while setting the process working directory had patched in the v1.0.1. The latest release is more stable now.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nMachine Learning plugin had been developed under GSoC 2020 program. A huge thanks to Bruno P. Kinoshita, Marky Jackson, Shivay Lamba, Ioannis Moutsatsos and Org admins for this wonderful experience.\nI would be grateful for contributing this plugin continuously and more in Jenkins.\n\nResources\n\nCommunity Bonding blog post\n\nPhase 1 blog post\n\nPhase 2 blog post\n\nGithub\n\nProject page\n\nPlugin page\n\nDesign document","title":"Machine Learning Plugin project - Coding Phase 3 blog post","tags":["machinelearning","datascience","jupyter","plugins","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/9b030/loghijiaha.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/f38b5/loghijiaha.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/bcd2b/loghijiaha.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/ceea6/loghijiaha.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/45b82/loghijiaha.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/933cd/loghijiaha.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/6c13d/loghijiaha.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":158}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/loghijiaha.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"loghijiaha","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Computer Science and Engineering Student at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.
