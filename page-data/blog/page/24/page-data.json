Tyler Croy.\n\nSafely Upgrading Jenkins Every Single Day, by Baptiste Mathus.\n\nTyler will present the overall Jenkins Evergreen architecture, its inception and how this aims at making it much simpler for people to just use Jenkins to build their projects, without having to become Jenkins admins.\n\nOn the last conference day, during my own talk I will focus on the improved developer experience, and zoom into how we implemented some important features.\n\nWe will dig together into the Error Telemetry system put in place, allowing us to actually fix errors and warnings people see in production environments.\nHow instances are automatically reporting errors to the Evergreen backend, and how we then centralize and analyze them using Sentry.\nWe will explain how the Incrementals system allows developers a very short roundtrip, between a merged pull-request and a release we can push out to all instances.\nWe will see concrete examples of issues we already fixed and released to Evergreen instances in just a few days after we opened an alpha version to the world.\n\nI will show you how an instance starts up and gets upgraded by discussing with the backend it’s constantly connected to.\nHow the backend knows what it should instruct an instance to download and install, or how we trigger an automated data snapshot.\n\nYou will obviously see a demo of all this showing in particular how Evergreen can already run on a Docker host, or on AWS (more environments to come!), using some of the so-called flavors for Jenkins Evergreen.\n\nCome meet us at\nDevOps World | Jenkins World 2018 on September 16-19th in San Francisco.\nWe will be hanging out around the OSS space, eager to answer more questions.\n\nRegister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Speaker blogpost: Jenkins Evergreen At DevOps World | Jenkins World 2018","tags":["jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2018","evergreen"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8e8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/ede19/batmat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/bc20c/batmat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/b691b/batmat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/8ba60/batmat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/a9ea7/batmat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/51559/batmat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/28f98/batmat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":130}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/batmat.jpg"},"blog":"http://batmat.net","github":"batmat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Baptiste has been using and contributing to Jenkins since it was called differently, and is a huge proponent of the Agile, Devops &amp; Continuous Delivery movements.\nHe loves to discuss not only the technical aspects, but also the even more essential cultural aspects of this all, working together to improve the value provided to customers in a great inclusive and blameless environment.</p>\n</div>","id":"batmat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Baptiste Mathus","slug":"/blog/authors/batmat/","twitter":"bmathus"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","id":"4f66e646-7f00-5fcb-825e-a751b21abc62","slug":"/blog/2018/09/12/2018-community-survey/","strippedHtml":"Take the 5th Annual DevOps and Jenkins Community Survey\n\nWith DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco right around the corner, CloudBees is excited to sponsor the 2018 DevOps and Jenkins Community Survey. We want to capture the details of your DevOps experience in order to provide valuable insights to the Jenkins Community and beyond. Our community is stronger together - and this look at our collective experience will reveal the big picture and shine a light on key trends. This year, as the Jenkins project continues to evolve with Jenkins X , Configuration as Code and more, your input is more critical than ever.\n\nLet’s look at what we learned in 2016 and 2017:\n\nIn 2016 we found that:\n\nJenkins continued to hold the position as a company standard orchestration solution.\n\n29% of respondents companies use Jenkins on more than 50 projects\n\nIn regards to SCM tools, Git continued the march to dominance:\n\nGit usage increased to 85%\n\nSubversion usage decreased to 35%\n\nWhen it comes to practices, Agile and CI seemed to be the standard, and CD adoption still had a ways to go:\n\n85% practiced Agile\n\n82% practiced CI\n\n61% practiced DevOps\n\n46% practiced CD\n\nIn 2017 respondents reported that:\n\nJenkins Pipeline gained widespread adoption with 89% of survey takers used pipeline or planned to use in 6 months or less.\n\nContainer technology was cemented as a key part of the CD/DevOps ecosystem, yet Kubernetes usage was just starting gain momentum at 20.15%:\n\nJenkins, CD, and DevOps are getting more attention from Architects with 39% of respondents identified as Architects, nearly double the previous year\n\nGit was the clear SCM of choice at 90%, increasing nearly 5% over last the previous year\n\nWhat will you and the community tell us this year?  Are more people practicing DevOps?  Is Kubernetes the leader in container orchestration?  Is pipeline the standard for creating workflows?  Take the survey and let’s find out!\n\nAs always, your personal information (name, email address and company) will NOT be used by CloudBees for sales or marketing and the survey results will be made publicly available to the Jenkins Community. We will also be publishing a blog series analyzing trends over the last 5 years and offering  predictions on the evolution of DevOps. If you’re curious about what insights your input will provide, see the results of last year’s 2017 survey.\n\nAs an added incentive to participate, CloudBees will enter participants into a drawing for a free pass to DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 (1st prize, $1,199.00 value) or a $100 Amazon gift card (2nd prize)!\n\nThe survey will close at the end of October so grab a cup of coffee get started. We promise the survey will be done before your latte is.\n\nTake me to the survey.\n\nThere are laws that govern prize giveaways and eligibility; CloudBees has compiled all those fancy terms and conditions here.","title":"2018 DevOps|Jenkins Community Survey Now Open","tags":["jenkins","devops","jenkinsworld2018"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"bvdawson","html":"<div

few months ago I published a\nblog post about\nCloud Native Special Interest Group (SIG)\nand ongoing projects related to Cloud Native Jenkins.\nNext week we will be presenting at DevOps World | Jenkins World together with Carlos Sanchez and Jesse Glick,\nso I would like to provide a heads up for\nour talk: “A Cloud Native Jenkins”.\n\nIn our talk, we will focus on the following topics: Pluggable Storage,\nour ephemeral Jenkins controllers experiments,\nand tools which may be used to implement single-shot controllers.\n\nPluggable Storage\n\nPluggable storage is one of the major areas we have been working on over the last few months.\nThere are a number of parallel stories which are summarized on\nthis page.\nThere has been significant progress in the areas of artifact storage, build logging and configuration storage.\nA number of Jenkins Enhancement Proposals were submitted and accepted,\nand there are plugin releases and prototypes for these stories.\n\nDuring our talk we will discuss the current status of these stories and future plans.\nIn particular, we will cover the following areas and reference implementations:\n\nStoring all your artifacts transparently, e.g. in a cloud service blob store like AWS S3.\n\nArtifact Manager for S3 Plugin is an implementation we have recently released\n\nProviding credentials from an external location.\n\nKubernetes Credentials Provider is one of the existing implementations for Kubernetes secrets\n\nSending and retrieving the build logs from a cloud service.\n\nWe are working on reference implementations for AWS CloudWatch Logs and\nElasticsearch\n\nStoring configuration data in external storage like Kubernetes Resources and SQL database\n\nStoring test results externally, e.g. in an SQL database or a specialized Test Management System\n\nThere are existing plugins for the areas above, but there is a difference in approach we have taken.\nInstead of creating new custom steps we extend Jenkins architecture in a way that the storage becomes transparent to users.\nFor example, with Artifact Manager for S3 Plugin common Archive Artifacts steps\nwork transparently with Remote storage, as well as Jenkins Pipeline’s stash() / unstash() steps.\n\nThe reference implementations intentionally use different technologies so that we cover more scenarios.\nWe regularly discuss the implementations in the Cloud Native SIG,\nand we would appreciate your feedback.\n\nEphemeral Jenkins controllers research\n\nWant something new?\nSeveral days ago Kohsuke Kawaguchi, the creator of Jenkins, posted the\nJenkins: Shifting Gears article to summarize the plan for Jenkins evolution.\nCloud Native Jenkins is a critical part of this plan, and it is not “just Jenkins X”.\nThere are various architectural changes in Jenkins required to make this vision happen,\nand we plan to work on these changes in the Cloud Native SIG.\n\nIn our presentation, we will talk about our experiment with ephemeral Jenkins and single-shot controllers.\nIn this story we are creating a headless single-shot controller which starts in a container,\nexecutes a Pipeline build and pushes all the results to remote storage so that the container can just be deleted after completion.\nSuch a controller bundles plugins and self-configuration logic using “Configuration as Code”,\nso that it can start executing Pipelines in just a few seconds.\nOnce packaged, it can be invoked from CLI as simply as…​\n\ndocker run --rm -v $PWD/demo/Jenkinsfile:/workspace/Jenkinsfile onenashev/cwp-jenkinsfile-runner-demo\n\nor, in Kubernetes:\n\nkubectl create configmap jenkinsfile --from-file=demo/Jenkinsfile\nkubectl create -f demo/kubernetes.yaml\n\nSuch a single-shot controller could also be made a part of a Cloud Native Jenkins system.\nStandard event handlers like Prow can invoke the builds on webhooks and report results back,\nso that the single-shot controller can be used to build pull requests or to run Continuous Delivery flows.\nExtra agents could also be connected to the controller on-demand, using the Kubernetes plugin or sidecar containers.\n\nTools\n\nIn order to make this experiment possible, we used a toolchain based on\nDocker,\nJenkinsfile Runner,\nConfiguration as Code Plugin (JCasC), and a\nCustom WAR Packager tool which glues all the things together.\n\nCustom WAR Packager is a new tool which takes various configurations (YAML specification defining core version, list of plugins, system properties, Groovy Hooks, JCasC YAMLs)…​\nand then bundles everything as a ready-to-fly WAR file or Docker image.\nStarting from version 1.2, Custom WAR Packager also supports packaging Jenkinsfile Runner images as an experimental feature.\nI will do a separate blogpost about this new tool later,\nbut there is already some documentation a number of demos in the project’s repo.\n\nOur demo\n\nYes, we will have a demo! We will show a single-shot controller running with Pluggable storage implementations for AWS environments (Amazon S3, AWS CloudWatch, EKS, etc.),\nwhich executes Jenkins Pipelines for Maven projects and provisions agents in Kubernetes on-demand.\n\nThe demo has to be published yes, but you can already find a more simple Jenkinsfile Runner demo\nhere.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nThe upcoming DevOps World | Jenkins World conferences\nare heavily packed with talks related to Cloud Native Jenkins,\nincluding war stories and presentations on projects like Jenkins X and Jenkins Evergreen.\nIt is a great chance to get more information about using Jenkins in cloud environments.\n\nIf you are a Jenkins contributor or just want to become a contributor,\nalso join the Contributor Summit (Sep 17 in US and Oct 23 in Nice) or visit the Jenkins community booth in the Exhibition hall.\nAt the Contributor Summit on Sep 17 we will also have a face-to-face Cloud Native SIG meeting.\nFeel free to contribute to the agenda here.\n\nCome meet Carlos, Jesse, Oleg, and other Cloud Native SIG members at\nJenkins World on September 16-19th in San Francisco and on October 22-25 in Nice.\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Speaker blogpost: A Cloud Native Jenkins","tags":["jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2018","cloud-native","pluggable-storage","jenkinsfile-runner"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/oleg_nenashev.png"},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev/","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"023ce63a-1296-5fa9-b1fd-4c4141fdc95b","slug":"/blog/2018/09/11/speaker-blog-warnings-plugin/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins' Warnings plugin collects compiler warnings or issues reported by static analysis tools and visualizes the\nresults. The plugin (and the associated static analysis plugin suite) has been part of the Jenkins plugin eco-system\nfor more than ten years now. In order to optimize user experience and support Pipeline, a major rewrite of\nthe whole set of plugins was necessary. This new version (code name White Mountain) is now available as a public\nbeta. Please download and install this new version and help us to identify problems before the API is sealed.\n\nThe new release is available in the\nexperimental update center.\nIt has built-in support for almost hundred static analysis tools (including several compilers), see the list of\nsupported report formats.\n\nFeatures overview\n\nThe Warnings plugin provides the following features when added as a post build action (or step) to a job:\n\nThe plugin scans the console log of a Jenkins build or files in the workspace of your job for any kind of issues.\nThere are almost one hundred\nreport formats supported.\nAmong the problems it can detect:\n\nerrors from your compiler (C, C#, Java, etc.)\n\nwarnings from a static analysis tool (CheckStyle, StyleCop, SpotBugs, etc.)\n\nduplications from a copy-and-paste detector (CPD, Simian, etc.)\n\nvulnerabilities\n\nopen tasks in comments of your source files\n\nThe plugin publishes a report of the issues found in your build, so you can navigate to a summary report from the\nmain build page. From there you can also dive into the details:\n\ndistribution of new, fixed and outstanding issues\n\ndistribution of the issues by severity, category, type, module, or package\n\nlist of all issues including helpful comments from the reporting tool\n\nannotated source code of the affected files\n\ntrend charts of the issues\n\nIn the next sections, I’ll show the new and enhanced features in more detail.\n\nOne plugin for all tools\n\nPreviously the warnings plugin was part of the static analysis suite that provided the same set of features through\nseveral plugins (CheckStyle, PMD, Static Analysis Utilities, Analysis Collector etc.).\nIn order to simplify the user experience and the development process, these\nplugins and the core functionality have been merged into the warnings plugin. All other plugins are not required\nanymore and will not be supported in the future. If you currently use one of these plugins you should migrate\nto the new recorders and steps as soon as possible. I will still maintain the old code for a while,\nbut the main development effort will be spent into the new code base.\n\nThe following plugins have been integrated into the beta version of the warnings plugin:\n\nAndroid-Lint Plugin\n\nCheckStyle Plugin\n\nCCM Plugin\n\nDry Plugin\n\nPMD Plugin\n\nFindBugs Plugin\n\nAll other plugins still need to be integrated or need to be refactored to use the new API.\n\nNew pipeline support\n\nRequirements for using the Warnings plugin in Jenkins Pipeline can be complex and sometimes controversial.\nIn order to be as flexible as possible I decided to split the main step into two individual parts,\nwhich could then be used independently from each other.\n\nSimple pipeline configuration\n\nThe simple pipeline configuration is provided by the step recordIssues. This step is automatically derived from the\nFreeStyle job recorder: it scans for issues in a given set of files (or in the console log) and reports these issues\nin your build. You can use the snippet generator to create a working snippet that calls this step. A typical example\nof this step is shown in the following example:\n\nrecordIssues\n    enabledForFailure: true,\n    tools: [[pattern: '*.log', tool: [$class: 'Java']]],\n    filters: [includeFile('MyFile.*.java'), excludeCategory('WHITESPACE')]\n\nIn this example, the files '*.log' are scanned for Java issues. Only issues with a file name matching the\npattern 'MyFile.*.java' are included. Issues with category 'WHITESPACE' will be excluded. The\nstep will be executed even if the build failed. The recorded report of warnings will be published under the fixed\nURL 'https://[ your-jenkins ]/job/[ your-job ]/java'. URL or name of the report can be changed if required.\n\nAdvanced Pipeline Configuration\n\nSometimes publishing and reporting issues using a single step is not sufficient. For instance, if you build your\nproduct using several parallel steps and you want to combine the issues from all of these steps into\na single result. Then you need to split scanning and aggregation. Therefore, the plugin  provides the following\ntwo steps that are combined by using an intermediate result object:\n\nscanForIssues : this step scans a report file or the console log with a particular parser and creates an\nintermediate report object that contains the report.\n\npublishIssues : this step publishes a new report in your build that contains the aggregated results\nof one or several scanForIssues steps.\n\nYou can see the usage of these two steps in the following example:\n\ndef java = scanForIssues tool: [$class: 'Java']\ndef javadoc = scanForIssues tool: [$class: 'JavaDoc']\n\npublishIssues issues:[java, javadoc], filters:[includePackage('io.jenkins.plugins.analysis.*')]\n\ndef checkstyle = scanForIssues tool: [$class: 'CheckStyle'], pattern: '**/target/checkstyle-result.xml'\npublishIssues issues:[checkstyle]\n\ndef pmd = scanForIssues tool: [$class: 'Pmd'], pattern: '**/target/pmd.xml'\npublishIssues issues:[pmd]\n\npublishIssues id:'analysis', name:'White Mountains Issues', issues:[checkstyle, pmd],\n    filters:[includePackage('io.jenkins.plugins.analysis.*')]\n\nFiltering issues\n\nThe created report of issues can be filtered afterwards. You can specify an arbitrary number of include or exclude\nfilters. Currently, there is support for filtering issues by module name, package or namespace name, file name,\ncategory or type.\n\nAn example pipeline that uses such a filter is shown in the following snippet:\n\nrecordIssues\n    tools: [[pattern: '*.log', tool: [$class: 'Java']]],\n    filters: [includeFile('MyFile.*.java'), excludeCategory('WHITESPACE')]\n\nQuality gate configuration\n\nYou can define several quality gates that will be checked after the issues have been reported. These quality gates\nlet you to modify Jenkins' build status so that you immediately see if the desired quality of your product is met.\nA build can be set to unstable or failed for each of these quality gates. All quality gates use a simple metric:\nthe maximum number of issues that can be found and still pass a given quality gate.\n\nAn example pipeline that enables a quality gate for 10 warnings in total or 1 new warning is shown in the\nfollowing snippet:\n\nrecordIssues\n    tools: [[pattern: '*.log', tool: [$class: 'Java']]], unstableTotalHigh: 10, unstableNewAll: 1\n\nIssues history: new, fixed, and outstanding issues\n\nOne highlight of the plugin is the ability to categorize issues of subsequent builds as new, fixed and outstanding.\n\nUsing this feature makes it a lot easier to keep the quality of your project under control: you can focus\nonly on those warnings that have been introduced recently.\n\nNote: the detection of new warnings is based on a complex algorithm that tries to track the same warning in\ntwo two different versions of the source code. Depending on the extend of the modification of the source code\nit might produce some false positives, i.e., you might still get some new and fixed warnings even if there should\nbe none. The accuracy of this algorithm is still ongoing research and will be refined in the next couple of months.\n\nSeverities\n\nThe plugin shows the distribution of the severities of the issues in a chart. It defines the\nfollowing default severities, but additional ones might be added by plugins that extend the warnings plugin.\n\nError : Indicates an error that typically fails the build\n\nWarning (High, Normal, Low): Indicates a warning of the given priority. Mapping to the priorities\nis up to the individual parsers.\n\nNote that not every parser is capable of producing warnings with a different severity. Some of the parses simply\nuse the same severity for all issues.\n\nBuild Trend\n\nIn order to see the trend of the analysis results, a chart showing the number of issues per build is also\nshown. This chart is used in the details page as well as in the job overview. Currently, type and configuration\nof the chart is fixed. This will be enhanced in future versions of the plugin.\n\nIssues Overview\n\nYou can get a fast and efficient overview of the reported set of issues in several aggregation views.\nDepending on the number or type of issues you will see the distribution of issues by\n\nStatic Analysis Tool\n\nModule\n\nPackage or Namespace\n\nSeverity\n\nCategory\n\nType\n\nEach of these detail views are interactive, i.e. you can navigate into a subset of the categorized issues.\n\nIssues Details\n\nThe set of reported issues is shown in a modern and responsive table. The table is loaded on demand using an Ajax\ncall. It provides the following features:\n\nPagination : the number of issues is subdivided into several pages which can be selected by using the provided page\nlinks. Note that currently the pagination is done on the client side, i.e. it may take some time to obtain the whole table of\nissues from the server.\n\nSorting : the table content can be sorted by clicking on ony of the table columns.\n\nFiltering, Searching : you can filter the shown issues by entering some text in the search box.\n\nContent Aware : columns are only shown if there is something useful to display. I.e., if a tool does not report an\nissues category, then the category will be automatically hidden.\n\nResponsive : the layout should adapt to the actual screen size.\n\nDetails : the details message for an issue (if provided by the corresponding static analysis tool) is shown as\nchild row within the table.\n\nRemote API\n\nThe plugin provides two REST API endpoints.\n\nSummary of the analysis result\n\nYou can obtain a summary of a particular analysis report by using the URL [tool-id]/api/xml\n(or [tool-id]/api/json). The summary contains the number of issues, the quality gate status, and all\ninfo and error messages.\n\nDetails of the analysis result\n\nThe reported issues are also available as REST API. You can either query all issues or only the\nnew, fixed, or outstanding issues. The corresponding URLs are:\n\n[tool-id]/all/api/xml : lists all issues\n\n[tool-id]/fixed/api/xml : lists all fixed issues\n\n[tool-id]/new/api/xml : lists all new issues\n\n[tool-id]/outstanding/api/xml : lists all outstanding issues\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nI hope these new features are useful for everyone!

This is a message for my fellow Jenkins developers.\n\nJenkins has been on an amazing run, but I believe we are trapped in a local optimum, and losing appeal to people who fall outside of our traditional sweet spot.\nWe need to take on new efforts to solve this. One is “cloud native Jenkins” that creates a flavor of Jenkins that runs well on Kubernetes.\nThe other is “gear shift”, where we take an evolutionary line from the current Jenkins 2, but with breaking changes in order to gain higher development speed.\n\nI say it’s time we tackle these problems head on. I’ve been talking to various folks, and I think we need to take on two initiatives.\nOne is what I call \"Cloud Native Jenkins,\" and the other is to insert a jolt in Jenkins.\n\nSome of you have already seen the presentation I posted on the Jenkins YouTube channel.  In this post, I’ll expand on that with some additional details.\n\nJenkins: Shifting Gears Presentation ( Slides)\n\nCome hear more in Kohsuke’s keynote at\nJenkins World on September 16-19th,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.\n\nOur Amazing Success\n\nOur project has been an amazing success over the past 10+ years, thanks to you all. What started as my hobby project became a huge community that boasts thousands of contributors and millions of users.\nWhen I think about what enabled this amazing journey, I can think of several magic sauces:\n\nExtensible:\nthe ability to take the system, or a portion of the system, then build on top of it to achieve what you need, without anyone else’s permission.\nHere, I’m not talking about the specific technical mechanism of Guice, extension point, etc, but rather I’m talking more broadly about the governance, culture, distribution mechanism, and so on.\n\nGeneral purpose:\nAt the base level, Jenkins can be used for any kind of automation around the area of software development.\nThis matched the reality of the software engineering world well.\nCombined with extensibility, this general purpose system that is Jenkins can specialize into any domain, much like Linux and JetBrains IDEs.\n\nCommunity:\nTogether we created a community where different people push envelopes in different directions and share the fruits with others.\nThis meant everyone can benefit from somebody else’s work, and great ideas and best practices spread more quickly.\n\nOur Challenges\n\nThe way we set up our community meant that collectively we were able to work toward solving certain kinds of problems locally and organically, such as Android application development, new UX, more expressive pipeline description language, …​\n\nBut at the same time, the incremental, autonomous nature of our community made us demonstrably unable to solve certain kinds of problems.\nAnd after 10+ years, these unsolved problems are getting more pronounced, and they are taking a toll — segments of users correctly feel that the community doesn’t get them, because we have shown an inability to address some of their greatest difficulties in using Jenkins.\nAnd I know some of those problems, such as service instability, matter to all of us.\n\nIn a way, we are stuck in a local optimum, and that is a dangerous place to be when there is growing competition from all sides.\nSo we must solve these problems to ensure our continued relevance and popularity in the space.\n\nSolving those problems starts with correctly understanding them, so let’s look at those.\n\nService Instability\n\nCI/CD service was once a novelty and a nice-to-have.\nToday, it is very much a mission critical service, in no small part because of us!\nIncreasingly, people are running bigger and bigger workloads, loading up more and more plugins, and expect higher and higher availability.\n\nAdmins today are unable to meet that heightened expectation using Jenkins easily enough.\nA Jenkins instance, especially a large one, requires too much overhead just to keep it running.\nIt’s not unheard of that somebody restarts Jenkins every day.\n\nAdmins expect errors to be contained and not impact the entire service.\nThey expect Jenkins to defend itself better from issues such as pipeline execution problems, run-away processes, over resource consumption so that they don’t have to constantly babysit the service.\n\nEvery restart implies degraded service for the software delivery teams where they have to wait longer for their builds to start or complete.\n\nBrittle Configuration\n\nEvery Jenkins admin must have been burnt at least once in the past by making changes that have caused unintended side effects.\nBy “changes,” I’m talking about installing/upgrading plugins, tweaking job settings, etc.\n\nAs a result, too many admins today aren’t confident that they can make changes safely.\nThey fear that their changes might cause issues for their software delivery teams, that those teams will notice regressions before they do, and that they may not be able to back out somes changes easily.\nIt feels like touching a Jenga tower for them, even when a change is small.\n\nUpgrading Jenkins and plugins is an important sub case of this, where admins often do not have understanding of the impact.\nThis decreases the willingness to upgrade, which in turn makes it difficult for the project to move forward more rapidly, and instead we get trapped with the long tail of compatibility burden.\n\nAssembly Required\n\nI’ve often described Jenkins as a bucket full of LEGO blocks — you can build any car you want, but everyone first has to assemble their own car in order to drive one.\n\nAs CI/CD has gone mainstream, this is no longer OK.\nPeople want something that works out of the box, something that gets people to productivity within 5 clicks in 5 minutes.\nToo many choices are confusing users, and we are not helping them toward “the lit path.”\nEveryone feels uncertain if they are doing the right thing, contributors are spread thin, and the whole thing feels a bit like a Frankenstein.\n\nThis is yet another problem we can’t solve by “writing more plugins.”\n\nReduced Development Velocity\n\nThis one is a little different from others that our users face, but nonetheless a very important one, because it impacts our ability to expand and sustain the developer community, and influences how fast we can solve challenges that our users face.\n\nSome of these problems are not structural and rather just a matter of doing it (for example, Java 11 upgrade), but there are some problems here that are structural.\n\nI think the following ones are the key ones:\n\nAs a contributor, a change that spans across multiple plugins is difficult.\nTooling gets in the way, users might not always upgrade a group of changes together, reviewing changes is hard.\n\nAs a contributor, the tests that we have do not give me enough confidence to ship code.\nNot enough of them run automatically, coverage is shallow, and there just isn’t anything like production workload of real users/customers.\n\nThese core problems create other downstream problems, for example:\n\nAs a non-regular contributor, what I think of as a small and reasonable change takes forever and a 100 comments going back & forth to get in. I get discouraged from ever doing it again.\n\nAs a regular contributor, I feel people are throwing crap over the wall, and if they cause problems after a release, I’m on the hook to clean up that mess.\n\nAs a user, I get a half-baked change that wreaks havoc, which results in loss of their confidence to Jenkins, an even slower pace of change, etc. This is a vicious cycle as it makes us even more conservative, and slow down the development velocity.\n\nPath Forward\n\nIn the past, my frustration and regret is that we couldn’t take on an effort of this magnitude.\nBut that is NO MORE!\nAs CTO of CloudBees, I’m excited that these challenges are important enough for CloudBees now that we want to solve these efforts within the Jenkins project.\n\nI’ve been talking to many of you, and there are a number of existing efforts going on that touch this space already.\nFrom there, the vision emerged is that we organize around two key efforts:\n\nCloud Native Jenkins: a general purpose CI/CD engine that runs on Kubernetes, and embraces a fundamentally different architecture and extensibility mechanism.\n\nJolt in Jenkins: continue the incremental trajectory of Jenkins 2 today, but with renegotiated “contract” with users to gain what we really need, such as faster pace of development and better stability.\n\nCloud Native Jenkins\n\nIn order to solve these problems that we can’t solve incrementally,\nI’m proposing the “Cloud Native Jenkins” sub-project in the context of the\nCloud Native SIG\nwith Carlos, who is the leader of this SIG.\n\nWe don’t have all the answers, that’s something we’ll discuss and figure out collectively, but based on numerous conversations with various folks, I think there are many clear pieces of puzzles.\n\nKubernetes as the Runtime\n\nJust like Java was the winning server application platform in the early 2000s, today, Kubernetes is the dominant, winning platform.\nCloud Native Jenkins should embrace the paradigm this new platform encourages. For example,\n\nServerless / function-as-a-service build execution (ala\nJenkinsfile runner)\nthat are isolated.\n\nVarious pieces of functionalities deployed as separate microservices.\n\nServices interacting through\nKubernetes CRDs\nin order to promote better reuse and composability.\n\nThese are the design principles that enable highly desirable properties like infinite scalability, pay-as-you-go cost model, immutability, zero down time operability, etc.\n\nNew Extensibility Mechanism\n\nWe need to introduce a new mechanism of extensibility in order to retain the magic sauces, and continue our incredible ecosystem.\n\nFor example, microservice or container-based extensibility avoids the service instability problem (ala\nKnative builder\nand the\nuserspace-scm work.)\nPipeline shared libraries is another example that concretely shows how extensibility mechanism can go beyond plugin, though it hasn’t fully flourished as one just yet.\n\nData on Cloud Managed Data Services\n\nThe long-term data storage must be moved from the file system to data services backed by cloud managed services, in order to achieve high availability and horizontal scalability, without burdening admins with additional operational responsibilities.\n\nConfiguration as Code\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code\nhas been incredibly well received, in part because it helps to solve some of the brittle configuration problems.\nIn Cloud Native Jenkins, JCasC must play a more central role, which in turn also helps us reduce the surface area for Blue Ocean to cover by eliminating many configuration screens.\n\nEvergreen\n\nJenkins Evergreen\nis another well received effort that’s already underway, which aims to solve the brittleness problem and developer velocity problem. This is a key piece of the puzzle that allows us to move faster without throwing users under the bus.\n\nSecure by Default Design\n\nOver the past years, we’ve learned that several different areas of Jenkins codebase, such as Remoting, are inherently prone to security vulnerabilities because of their design. Cloud Native Jenkins must address those problems by flipping those to “secure by design.”\n\nFollowing Footsteps of Jenkins X\n\nJenkins X\nhas been pioneering the use of Jenkins on Kubernetes for a while now, and it has been very well received, too.\nSo naturally, part of the aim of Cloud Native Jenkins is to grow and morph Jenkins into a shape that really works well for Jenkins X.\nCloud Native Jenkins will be the general purpose CI/CD engine that runs on Kubernetes, which Jenkins X uses to create an opinionated CD experience for developing cloud native apps.\n\nAll The Same Good Things, with New Foundation\n\nAnd then on top of these foundations, we need to rebuild or transplant all the good things that people love about Jenkins today, and all the good things people expect, such as:\n\nGreat “batteries included” onboarding experience for new users, where we are present in all the marketplaces, 5 clicks to get going and easy integration with key services.\n\nModern lovable UX in the direction of front-end web apps that Blue Ocean pioneered.\n\nGeneral purpose software that is useful for all sorts of software development.\n\nCloud Native Jenkins MVP\n\nAs I wrote, a number of good efforts are already ongoing today. Thus in order to get this effort off the ground, I believe the first MVP that we aim toward is pretty clear, which is to build a function-as-a-service style Jenkins build engine  that can be used underneath Jenkins X.\n\nCloud Native Jenkins MVP combines the spirits of Jenkins Pipeline, Jenkins Evergreen, Jenkinsfile Runner, and Jenkins Configuration as Code.\nIt consists of:\n\nWebhook receiver:\na service that receives webhooks from GitHub and triggers a build engine.\n\nBuild Engine:\ntake Jenkinsfile Runner and evolve it so that it can run as a “function” that carries out a pipeline execution, with some CasC sprinkled together in order to control Jenkins configuration and plugins  used.\nThis way, Jenkinsfile works as-is for the most part.\n\nContinuously delivered through Evergreen:\nIt allows us to solve the combinatorial version explosion problem, allow us to develop changes that span multiple plugins faster, and develop changes more confidently.\nOf all the projects out there, ours should be the community that believes in the value of Continuous Delivery and Evergreen is how we bring continuous delivery to the development of Cloud Native Jenkins itself.\n\nThis solves some of the key challenges listed above that are really hard to achieve today, so it’s already incredibly useful.\n\nThe catch is that this MVP has no GUI. There’s no Blue Ocean UI to look at. No parsing of test reports, no build history. It uses no persistent volumes, it keeps no record of builds. The only thing permanent at the end of a build is whatever data is pushed out from Jenkins Pipeline, such as images pushed to a Docker registry, email notifications, and GitHub commit status updates.  Load of other features in Jenkins will not be available here.\n\nThis is not that far from how some sophisticated users are deploying Jenkins today. All in all, I think this is the right trade off for the first MVP. As you can see, we have most of the pieces already.\n\nFrom here, the build engine will get continuously more polished and more cloud native, other services will get added to regain features that were  lost, new extensibility will get introduced to reduce the role of current in-VM plugins, and so on.\n\nJolt in Jenkins\n\nCloud Native Jenkins is a major effort and in particular initially it’s not usable for everyone; it only targets a subset of Jenkins functionalities, and it requires a platform whose adoption is still limited today.\nSo in parallel, we need to continue the incremental evolution of Jenkins 2, but in an accelerated speed. Said differently, we need to continue to serve the majority of production workload on Jenkins 2 today, but we are willing to break some stuff to gain what we really need, such as faster pace of development and better stability, in ways that were previously not possible. This requires us injecting a jolt in Jenkins.\n\nRelease Model Change\n\nThe kind of jolts that we need will almost certainly means we need to renegotiate the expectation around new releases with our users.\nMy inspiration source is what happened to the development of Java SE. It changed the release model and started moving faster, by shedding off more pieces faster, in ways that they haven’t done before.\nAgain, Jenkins Evergreen is the key piece that achieves this without throwing users under a bus, for the reasons I described in the Cloud Native MVP above.\n\nCompatibility\n\nThis jolt is aimed to put us on a different footing, one where our current “forever compatibility” expectation does not hold. If that requires us to use a new major version number, such as Jenkins 3, or new major version number every N months, I’m open to that.\n\nOf course, whatever move we do has to make sense to users. The accelerated pace of value delivery needs to justify any inconvenience we put on users, such as migration, breaking changes, and so on.\n\nIn practice, what that means is that we need to be largely compatible. We have to protect users’ investment into their existing job definitions as much as possible. We continue to run freestyle jobs, etc…​\n\nIngredients\n\nOther proposals CloudBees is putting forward with the intent to staff the effort are:\n\nConfiguration as Code: accelerate that and make it a more central  part of Jenkins.\n\nDeveloper experience improvements through buildpack style auto-detection of project types.\n\nContinued evolution of Jenkins Pipeline\n\nThere’s an effort going on to remove CPS execution of Pipeline and isolate any failures during pipeline execution.\n\nContinue to evolve Jenkins Pipeline toward the sweet spot that works well with the Cloud Native Jenkins effort.\n\nContinued tactical bug-by-bug improvements of Pipeline.\n\nEvergreen: I already talked about this above.\n\nPlugin spring cleaning: let’s actively guide users more toward the sweet spot of Jenkins and reduce our feature surface area, so that we can focus our contributors’ effort to important parts of Jenkins. I expect this to be a combination of governance and technical efforts.\n\nTable stakes service integration: let’s look at what kind of tablestake tool/service integrations today’s user need, and\nsee if we are meeting/exceeding the competition.\nWhere we fall short, let’s add/reimplement what are needed.\n\nUI Effort\n\nThe Web UI will be likely done differently in Cloud Native Jenkins, as its own app and not a plugin in Jenkins. JCasC will also play a bigger role in Cloud Native Jenkins, reducing UI surface area from Jenkins.\n\nGiven that, CloudBees will reconsider where to spend its effort in Blue Ocean. The current work where parts of Blue Ocean are made reusable as NPM modules is one example that aligns well with this new vision.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis document lays out the key directions and approaches in a broad stroke, which I discussed with a number of you in the past. Hopefully, this gives you the big picture of how I envision where to move Jenkins forward, not just as the creator of Jenkins but as the CTO of CloudBees, who employs a number of key contributors to the Jenkins project.\n\nCome meet Kohsuke and chat with him about the direction of Jenkins at\nJenkins World on September 16-19th,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Jenkins: Shifting Gears","tags":["development","core"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/kohsuke.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke/","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","id":"76fe30c4-d5ca-529d-af0c-044c46a5a864","slug":"/blog/2018/08/30/speaker-blog-kubernetes-plugin/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest blog by Niklas Tanskanen, consultant at\nEficode.\n\nKubernetes, the container orchestration platform is rapidly becoming popular. There are more and more workloads that you can run on top of Kubernetes. It’s becoming an enabling layer of your Hyper-convergenced infrastructure.\n\nIf you set up Kubernetes as a Cloud provider in Jenkins, you’ll get a very powerful couple for running your workloads.\nTo do that, you can simply install\nKubernetes plugin.\nKubernetes is able to run your Jenkins workloads as long as they are run in container.\nAnd containers are an awesome way if your workload is a build, because you can pack all your application and OS dependencies in a container and then run it anywhere!\n\nLet’s imagine that you have been running a Kubernetes cluster setup in your organisation for a while now.\nFirst it was all about proof of concept but now its becoming more popular within your developers and you have to think about scaling and orchestration.\nResource quotas are a part of that and every responsible operator should set those up both in both development and production clusters.\nOtherwise people will be lazy and just reserve all the resources of your cluster without actually using those resources for anything.\nBy introducing quotas into your cluster, you can control how many resources should each namespace have.\n\nQuotas are a mature feature of Kubernetes already.\nYou have the possibility to create very fine grained quotas for different hardware resources, whenever it’s fast disk, GPUs or CPU time.\nYou can also specify multiple scopes of quota per one namespace.\nFor example, you can have a quota for workloads that are to be run to the infinity like web servers or databases.\nOr have quota for workloads that are short lived like builds or test automation runs.\n\nTable 1. Scopes\n\nScope\nDescription\n\nTerminating\nMatch pods where.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds >= 0\n\nNotTerminating\nMatch pods where.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds is nil\n\nBestEffort\nMatch pods that have best effort quality of service.\n\nNotBestEffort\nMatch pods that do not have best effort quality of service.\n\nDifferent scopes of Kubernetes quota\n\nSince Jenkins is all about running short workloads, you should aim for the Terminating scope of quota.\nBut how do you specify workloads in Jenkins so that correct scope is used?\n\nIf you were to do this in Kubernetes, you have to specify.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds.\nThe same field can also be specified by the Kubernetes plugin when you are specifying a Pod Template.\n\nFigure 1. Specifying.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds in the Kubernetes plugin\n\nSame configuration is available in the Jenkinsfile as well if you don’t like static configurations.\n\npodTemplate(label: 'maven', activeDeadlineSeconds: 180, containers: [\n    containerTemplate(name: 'maven', image: 'maven:3.5.4-jdk-10-slim')\n  ]) {\n  // maven magic\n}\n\nThis was just a small sample of features of the Kubernetes plugin in Jenkins.

yes, Jenkins World is coming to Europe.\n\nBut that’s not all!\nPraqma - the company I work for -\nhas organised a number of “Day of Jenkins” events around Scandinavia in past years.\nThis October they have decided to bring the events back with a theme: Day of Jenkins 2018 is\nDay of Jenkins [as code] .\nIt’s a two track one day event with presentations and hands-on sessions for users and a hackathon for contributors - in that specific case Configuration as Code Plugin’s contributors.\n\nDetailed agenda is available on the\nevent page -\nJenkins X, Jenkins Evergreen, Jenkins Configuration as Code and more waiting for you!\n\nI really can’t wait to hear what Kohsuke has to say and to introduce you to the plugin during the hands-on session I’ll run.\n\nHope to see you at least at one of those events!\n\nCome meet the Configuration as Code contributors, Nicolas de Loof and Ewelina Wilkosz at\nJenkins World on September 16-19th,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Day of Jenkins, and other chances to meet JCasC","tags":["jenkins","jcasc","configuration as code"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62cac5d7353c59176523b1ca3cb1166c/19e71/ewelinawilkosz.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62cac5d7353c59176523b1ca3cb1166c/77b35/ewelinawilkosz.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62cac5d7353c59176523b1ca3cb1166c/d4a57/ewelinawilkosz.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62cac5d7353c59176523b1ca3cb1166c/19e71/ewelinawilkosz.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62cac5d7353c59176523b1ca3cb1166c/68974/ewelinawilkosz.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62cac5d7353c59176523b1ca3cb1166c/ef6ff/ewelinawilkosz.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62cac5d7353c59176523b1ca3cb1166c/8257c/ewelinawilkosz.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62cac5d7353c59176523b1ca3cb1166c/6766a/ewelinawilkosz.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62cac5d7353c59176523b1ca3cb1166c/22bfc/ewelinawilkosz.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62cac5d7353c59176523b1ca3cb1166c/ewelinawilkosz.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"ewelinawilkosz","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Contributor since 2017, when she got involved in Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin development.\nVoted Most Valuable Contributor in 2018.\nShe has 14 years of experience in IT, currently working as a CI/CD consultant at Verifa.\nIn that role she’s trying to solve numerous issues Jenkins users are facing daily -
