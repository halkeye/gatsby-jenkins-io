jep:305[]) and\neven direct builds by Git or directory path specifications.\nIt allows building packages from any source, without waiting for official releases.\nThe builds are also pretty fast, because the plugin does caching in the local Maven repository by using commit IDs.\n\nCustom WAR packager also supports the following self-configuration options:\n\nYAML files for Jenkins Configuration as Code\n\nGroovy Hooks (e.g. init hooks for pre-configuration)\n\nSystem properties\n\nWAR Packaging\n\nWAR packaging happens by default every time the repo is built.\nGenerally Custom WAR Packager repackages all inputs into a single WAR file by following conventions defined in the Jenkins core and the JCasC plugin.\n\nSample configuration:\n\nbundle:\n  groupId: \"io.jenkins.tools.war-packager.demo\"\n  artifactId: \"blogpost-demo\"\n  vendor: \"Jenkins project\"\n  description: \"Just a demo for the blogpost\"\nwar:\n  groupId: \"org.jenkins-ci.main\"\n  artifactId: \"jenkins-war\"\n  source:\n    version: 2.138.2\nplugins:\n  - groupId: \"io.jenkins\"\n    artifactId: \"configuration-as-code\"\n    source:\n      # Common release\n      version: 1.0-rc2\n  - groupId: \"io.jenkins\"\n    artifactId: \"artifact-manager-s3\"\n    source:\n      # Incrementals\n      version: 1.2-rc259.c9d60bf2f88c\n  -

type: \"init\"\n    id: \"initScripts\"\n    source:\n      dir: src/main/groovy\ncasc:\n  - id: \"jcasc\"\n    source:\n      dir: casc.yml\n\nDocker packaging\n\nIn order to do the Docker packaging, Custom WAR Packager uses the official\njenkins/jenkins\nDocker images or other images using the same format.\nDuring the build the WAR file just gets replaced by the one built by the tool.\nIt means that ALL image features are available for such custom builds: plugins.txt, Java options, Groovy hooks, etc., etc.\n\n## ...\n## WAR configuration from above\n## ...\n\nbuildSettings:\n  docker:\n    build: true\n    # Base image\n    base: \"jenkins/jenkins:2.138.2\"\n    # Tag to set for the produced image\n    tag: \"jenkins/custom-war-packager-casc-demo\"\n\nFor example, this demo\nshows packaging of a Docker image with External Build Logging to Elasticsearch.\nAlthough the implementations have been improved as a part of jep:207[] and jep:210[],\nyou can check out this demo to see how the Docker image does self-configuration, connects to a Elasicsearch, and then starts externally storing logs without changes in build log UIs.\nA Docker Compose file for running the entire cluster is included.\n\nJenkinsfile Runner packaging\n\nThis is probably the most tricky mode of Jenkinsfile Runner.\nIn March a new Jenkinsfile Runner project\nwas announced in the developer mailing list.\nThe main idea is to support running Jenkins Pipeline in a single-shot controller mode when the instance just executes a single run and prints outputs to the console.\nJenkinsfile Runner runs as CLI or as a Docker image.\nCustom WAR Packager is able to produce both, though only Docker run mode is recommended.\nWith Jenkinsfile Runner you can run Pipelines simply as…​\n\ndocker run --rm -v $PWD/Jenkinsfile:/workspace/Jenkinsfile acmeorg/jenkinsfile-runner\n\nWhen we started working on Ephemeral (aka \"single-shot\") controllers in the Cloud Native SIG,\nthere was an idea to use Custom WAR Packager and other existing tools (Jenkinsfile Runner, Jenkins Configuration as Code, etc.) to implement it.\nIt would be possible to just replace Jenkins core JAR and add plugins to Jenkinsfile Runner, but it is not enough.\nTo be efficient, Jenkinsfile Runner images should start up FAST, really fast.\nIn the build flow implementation we used some experimental options available in Jenkins and Jenkinsfile Runner, including classloader precaching, plugin unarchiving, etc, etc.\nWith such patches Jenkins starts up in few seconds with configuration-as-code and dozens of bundled plugins.\n\nSo, how to build custom Jenkinsfile Runner images?\nAlthough there is no release so far, it is not something which can stop us as you see above.\n\n##...\n## WAR Configuration from above\n##...\n\nbuildSettings:\n  jenkinsfileRunner:\n    source:\n      groupId: \"io.jenkins\"\n      artifactId: \"jenkinsfile-runner\"\n      build:\n        noCache: true\n      source:\n        git: https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner.git\n        commit: 8ff9b1e9a097e629c5fbffca9a3d69750097ecc4\n    docker:\n      base: \"jenkins/jenkins:2.138.2\"\n      tag: \"onenashev/cwp-jenkinsfile-runner-demo\"\n      build: true\n\nYou can find a Demo of Jenkinsfile Runner packaging with Custom WAR Packager\nhere.\n\nMore info\n\nThere are many other features which are not described in this blogpost.\nFor example, it is possible to alter Maven build settings or to add/replace libraries within the Jenkins core (e.g. Remoting).\nPlease see the Custom WAR Packager documentation for more information.\nThere are a number of demos available in the repository.\n\nIf you are interested to contribute to the repository,\nplease create pull requests and CC @oleg-nenashev\nand Raul Arabaolaza who is the second maintainer now working on Jenkins test automation flows.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThere are still many improvements that could be made to the tool to make it more efficient:\n\nAdd upper bounds checks for transitive plugin dependencies so that the conflicts are discovered during the build\n\nAllow passing all kinds of system properties and Java options via configuration YAML\n\nImprove Jenkinsfile Runner to improve performance\n\nIntegrate the tool into Jenkins Integration test flows\n(see essentialsTest()\nin the Jenkins Pipeline library)\n\nMany other tasks could be implemented in Custom WAR Packager,\nbut even now it is available to all Jenkins users so that they can build their own Jenkins bundles with it.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nIf you are going to DevOps World - Jenkins World in Nice on Oct 22-25,\nI will be presenting Custom WAR Packager at the Community Booth during the lunch demo sessions.\nWe will be also repeating our A Cloud Native Jenkins talk together with Carlos Sanchez where we will show how Ephemeral Jenkins works with Pluggable Storage.\nJenkins X team is also going to present their project using Custom WAR Packager.\n\nCome meet Oleg and other Cloud Native SIG members at\nDevOps World -

has been a while since the last blogpost about Google Summer of Code in Jenkins.\nGSoC 2018 has officially finished on August 23, and we had a Jenkins Online Meetup where we had final presentations of the GSoC projects.\nIt is never late to provide more context, so I would like to summarize the results and provide updates of what was happening in Jenkins GSoC Special Interest Group over last 2 months.\nIn this blogpost you can find project status overviews and updates from the Jenkins GSoC SIG.\n\nBut first of all, I would like to thank all our students, their mentors\nand to all other contributors who proposed project ideas, participated in student selection, community bonding and further reviews.\nGoogle Summer of Code is a major effort which would not be possible without active participation of the Jenkins community\n\nSummary\n\nThis year we started preparing for Google Summer of Code in early December.\n14 project ideas and 12 potential mentors we published on our website,\nand we got dozens of students reaching out to us during the application period.\nAfter processing applications, we have selected 4 applications for GSoC.\nUnfortunately one project got cancelled due to student eligibility issues.\n\nSo, we had the following projects:\nCode Coverage API plugin, Remoting over Apache Kafka, and Simple Pull-Request Job Plugin\n(also known as Pipeline as YAML).\nAll these projects have a significant value to the Jenkins community.\nThey were focused on areas which have been discussed in the community for a long time,\nbut which had no progress so far.\nGoogle Summer of Code allowed us to kick-start these projects,\nand to make significant progress there.\nAll projects have been released and made available in the Jenkins community (common or experimental update centers).\n\nIn total there were 9 blogposts about GSoC projects on jenkins.io,\nand also 2 Jenkins Online Meetups.\nGSoC results have been also presented at DevOps World - Jenkins World conference and the contributor summit.\n\nCode Coverage API Plugin\n\nStudent: Shenyu Zheng, Henan University, China\n\nMentors:\nJeff Pearce,\nSteven Christou,\nOleg Nenashev,\nSupun Wanniarachchi\n\nProject page\n\nThere are many code coverage plugins in Jenkins: Cobertura, JaCoCo, Emma, etc., etc.\nThe problem with these plugins is that each of them implements all code coverage features on their own.\nSo you get different feature sets, UIs, CLI commands and REST APIs.\nThe idea of this project was to unify the existing functionality and offer a new API plugin which other plugins could extend.\nIt would help to simplify existing plugin and to create new plugins for coverage tools.\n\nThe project has started really well, and we had the first demo after a week of coding.\nThen Shenyu continued extending the plugin’s functionality over coding periods.\nHere is the list of the key features offered by the plugin:\n\nFlexible data structure for defining and storing coverage metrics within Jenkins\n\nCoverage charts and trends\n\nSource code navigation\n\nREST API for retrieving coverage stats and trends\n\nReport aggregation for parallel steps\n\nExtension points which allow integrating other plugins\n\nIn addition to the Code Coverage API Plugin,\nShenyu added integration to the Cobertura Plugin and also created a new llvm-cov plugin which is expected to be released soon.\n\nAfter GSoC Shenyu continued contributing to the Jenkins project.\nHe works on the Code Coverage API plugin and also participates in the Chinese Localization SIG.\n\nSimple Pull-Request Job Plugin\n\nStudent: Abhishek Gautam, Visvesvaraya National Institute of technology, India\n\nMentors:\nMartin d’Anjou,\nJeff Knurek,\nKristin Whetstone\n\nProject page\n\nThis project focused on introducing a way to\neasily define pull-request build job definitions in YAML.\nThis project has been shaped a lot during the application period and community bonding,\nso that the project fit the existing Jenkins Ecosystem better.\nFinally it was decided to build the new plugin on the top of Pipeline: Multi-Branch Plugin.\nThere was also an idea to offer extra syntax sugar, templating and automatic resolution for common flows,\nso that users need less time to define Pipelines for common use-cases.\n\nThe plugin allows defining Pipeline jobs as YAML being stored in SCM.\nOriginal design presumed a new job type,\nbut during community bonding and Phase 1 prototyping it was decided to build the plugin on the top of the existing Pipeline ecosystem and extension points.\nCurrently the plugin generates Declarative Pipeline code from YAML so that it gets a lot of Pipeline features out-of-the box.\nIn addition to that, Simple Pull Request Job Plugin uses a an engine provided by the Configuration as Code plugin to convert YAML snippets\nto Pipeline step definitions.\n\nThe plugin has been well described by Abhishek in his Pipeline as YAML blogpost in August.\nCurrently it is available in the Experimental Update Center as an alpha version.\nPham Vu Tuan, one of our GSoC students, have also joined the plugin team.\nAt the DevOps World - Jenkins World hackfest we had discussions with the Jenkins Pipeline team,\nand we have a plan towards making this plugin available as an Incubated Pipeline project.\nThe final implementation may change,\nbut in any case the project gave us a working prototype and a lot of information about  obstacles we need to resolve.\n\nRemoting over Apache Kafka\n\nStudent: Pham Vu Tuan, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore\n\nMentors:\nOleg Nenashev,\nSupun Wanniarachchi\n\nProject page\n\nLast but not least, Remoting over Kafka is another challenging project we had.\nTo implement communication between its controllers and agents, Jenkins widely uses home-grown protocol implementations based on TCP\n( JNLP 1..4 protocols).\nThere are some performance and stability implementations,\nand there have been discussions about using an industry-standard message bus or queue.\nPham Vu Tuan proposed to use Apache Kafka for it,\nand after some experiments during community bonding and first coding phase we agreed to go forward with this implementation.\n\nDuring his project Vu Tuan extended Jenkins Core and Remoting to allow implementing an agent communication channel in a plugin.\nThen he has created a new Remoting over Kafka plugin\nwhich is now available in the main Jenkins Update cente.\nOnce the plugin is installed, it is possible to connect to agents over Apache Kafka and execute all types of Jenkins jobs there.\nThere are also official jenkins/remoting-kafka-agent images available on DockerHub.\n\nVu Tuan continued contributing to the Jenkins project after GSoC, currently he maintains the Remoting over Kafka plugin.\nHe visited the DevOps World - Jenkins World US conference in September, presented his GSoC project at the\nJenkins Contributor Summit.\nYou can find his slides here.\nAfter the conference he also participated in the hackfest where he helped to migrate Jenkins' DNS services to Microsoft Azure.\n\nWhat could we do better?\n\nAfter the end of GSoC we had a Retrospective with GSoC students and mentors.\nWe discussed the issues we encountered during the projects,\nand ways to improve the student and mentor experience.\n\nMain takeaways for us:\n\nGSoC projects should be aligned with Jenkins Special Interest Groups (SIGs) or subprojects in order to get a wider list of stakeholders\nProjects should be aligned with SIG priorities when possible\n\nIn addition to GSoC SIG meetings and Jenkins Online Meetups during student evaluation,\nwe should also run regular status updates within SIGs so that there more contributors involved in projects\n\nWe should invest more time into forming mentor teams before the application period starts.\nThis year there were changes in mentor teams after the community bonding started, and it complicated the work\n\nWe should pay more attention to student eligibility.\nThis year we started from 4 projects, but unfortunately one project (EDA plugins for Jenkins) got cancelled due to the visa limitations the student had.\n\nWe should do regular office hours for mentors/students so that it is possible to exchange information between GSoC projects within the organization.\nThis year we cancelled them at the end of phase and relied only on regular project meetings and mailing lists, but this is not enough.\n\nFor me personally the main takeaway is also to reduce direct involvement into the project as a mentor and technical advisor.\nDoing org administration, logistics and mentorship is not good from a bus factor PoV,\nand I believe I was pushing my vision too hard in few cases.\nWill do my best to prevent it next year.\n\nIf you want to share your feedback and ideas,\nplease reach out to us using the GSoC mailing list.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn order to improve GSoC organization in Jenkins,\nwe have have created a GSoC Special Interest Group which will be running non-stop as other SIGs in Jenkins.\nThe objective of the SIG is to organize GSoC, work with potential students/mentors,\nand to help students stay involved in the community after GSoC ends.\nIn this SIG we will have monthly meetings to sync-up on GSoC.\nIf you are interested to contribute, please join the SIG.\n\nAccording to the Retrospective, next year we plan to invest more\ninto communication with mentors.\nWe will also try to tie new project proposals to Jenkins\nSpecial Interest Groups so that the students become a part\nof ongoing coordinated efforts.\nThis weekend Martin d’Anjou, Jeff Pearce and me are participating in the GSoC Mentor summit to share experiences and to study from other GSoC organizations.\nOn October 17 we will have a GSoC SIG meeting to discuss our experience and to discuss next steps.\n\nIn addition to that,\nJenkins Google Summer of Code will be presented at DevOps World - Jenkins World Nice and at the contributor summit.\nIf you plan to visit the conference and you are interested to participate in Google Summer of Code and other community activities,\nplease join us at the contributor summit or stop by at the community booth.\n\nAnd, elephant in the room…​ GSoC 2019.\nOf course we are going to apply, stay tuned for new announcements.\nWe have already started collecting project ideas for the next year.\nIf you are interested to participate as a student or mentor,\nplease reach out to us using the GSoC SIG mailing list.","title":"Jenkins in Google Summer of Code 2018

just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.146 and 2.138.2, that fix multiple security vulnerabilities.\n\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\nFor an overview on the possible impact of these changes on upgrading Jenkins LTS, see our LTS upgrade guide.\n\nFurther improvements\n\nIn addition to the security fixes listed in the security advisory, we also applied multiple improvements that make future security vulnerabilities more difficult, or even impossible to exploit.\n\nOne such improvement concerns cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and comes with a risk of regressions.\n\nJenkins uses a fork of Jelly for the vast majority of the views it renders.\nSince 2011, it includes a feature that lets view authors opt in or out of automatic escaping of variable values for rendering in HTML, and since 2016, the plugin build tooling requires that views explicitly specify whether to apply this automatic escaping.\nDetails are available in the developer documentation.\n\nUntil now, if views do not declare whether to automatically escape, they were rendered without automatic escaping, and developers were expected to explicitly escape every variable reference that was not supposed to contain markup.\nThis has resulted in a number of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, most recently SECURITY-1130 in Job Config History Plugin.\n\nFor that reason, we have decided to enable this automatic escaping by default if plugins do not specify a preference.\nThis can result in problems with some plugins if they need their output to remain unescaped.\nWe expect that those plugins will adapt pretty quickly to this change, as the fix is typically straightforward.\nWe track known affected plugins and their status on the Jenkins wiki.\n\nIn the mean time, users can set the system property org.kohsuke.stapler.jelly.CustomJellyContext.escapeByDefault to false to disable this additional protection.","title":"Important security updates for

of the major strengths of Jenkins is its customizability and extensibility.\nWith its plugin ecosystem and long list of (possibly hidden) options, Jenkins can be used for a wide range of use cases.\n\nThe downside of all this flexibility is that, not knowing how people use Jenkins, we mostly rely on issues filed in our bug tracker to know when things go wrong.\nAnd over the years, quite a few things have gone wrong.\nThe worst of these have been security fixes that have had unintended side effects.\nUnlike regular changes, it’s not really feasible to roll back security fixes, so users have sometimes had to choose between security and functionality.\nBut even changes developed in the open, such as the introduction of JEP-200, haven’t gone as smoothly as we hoped.\nWith big changes in the works, it’s more important than ever for us to have a better idea how Jenkins is used, so that we can deliver major changes safely.\n\nJenkins Evergreen solves this to some degree by being always connected to the Jenkins project and reporting back telemetry (mostly errors) allowing us to quickly react and provide fixes.\nBut that project is still pretty new, and its goal of being a more standardized Jenkins does not represent the breadth of configurations of the general user base.\n\nUplink telemetry\n\nSo we recently extended the existing, very limited anonymous usage statistics by adding a simple, extensible telemetry reporting client.\nWe’re calling it Uplink telemetry, based on the name of the service it reports its data to.\nIt made its debut in Jenkins 2.143.\n\nUplink telemetry is designed to collect data in trials, which are defined as:\n\na well defined set of technical data with a specific purpose\n\na start and end date of the collection\n\nDetailed information explaining the scope and purpose of currently active trials is available in the inline help for the usage statistics control in the global configuration.\n\nOf course, opting out of anonymous usage statistics there also disables the submission of Uplink telemetry.\nAnd while Uplink trials report a per-instance UUID to help with collation (e.g. removal of duplicate submissions), that UUID is exclusively used for this purpose, and independent of all other properties of an instance.\nThis prevents us from correlating reported data with specific instances.\nThese measures are in place to strike a balance between the need to understand how Jenkins is used and respecting users' privacy.\n\nImproving Jenkins through real-world data\n\nWe’re already created our first trial.\nJenkins 2.143 includes a trial to gather information about how common it is for instances to use Java system properties to disable (parts of) security fixes.\nWhen we publish a security fix and we’re not completely certain it is safe to apply for everyone, we add another of these options — just in case.\nAs you can imagine, quite a few of these hidden options exist.\nUntil now, user feedback in our issue tracker was the only way we could estimate the need for any of these options.\nWith Uplink, Jenkins will report that information to us.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to run for the next six weeks, enough to hopefully gather this information from a large number of users of both LTS and weekly releases.\nOur hope is that we will be able to remove some of these options entirely, as they might not be needed after all.\nFor others, we might need to consider elevating them to supported features, or finding better solutions obviating the need for them.\n\nIn the future, I will publish of some of what we have learned from the first trial running through Uplink telemetry.\nI look forward to Jenkins continuing to improve with real-world data informing our future decisions.","title":"Improving Jenkins

At this year’s DevOps World - Jenkins World in San Francisco, I will\nbe sharing more details on the philosophy behind Jenkins Evergreen, show off\nhow far we have come, and discuss where we’re going with this radical\ndistribution of Jenkins.\n\nAs discussed in my first blog post, and\nJEP-300,\nthe first two pillars of Jenkins Evergreen have been the primary focus of our\nefforts.\n\nAutomatically Updated Distribution\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, implementing the mechanisms necessary for safely and\nautomatically updating a Jenkins distribution, which includes core and plugins,\nwas and continues to be a sizable amount of work. In\nBaptiste’s talk\nhe will be speaking about the details which make Evergreen \"go\" whereas\nI will be speaking about why an automatically updating distribution is\nimportant.\n\nAs continuous integration and continuous delivery have become more commonplace,\nand fundamental to modern software engineering, Jenkins tends to live two\ndifferent lifestyles depending on the organization. In some organizations,\nJenkins is managed and deployed methodically with automation tools like Chef,\nPuppet, etc. In many other organizations however, Jenkins is treated much more\nlike an appliance, not unlike the office wireless router. Installed and so\nlong as it continues to do its job, people won’t think about it too much.\n\nJenkins Evergreen’s distribution makes the \"Jenkins as an Appliance\" model much\nbetter for everybody by ensuring the latest feature updates, bug and security\nfixes are always installed in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, I believe Evergreen will serve another group we don’t adequately\nserve at the moment: those who want Jenkins to behave much more like a\nservice. We typically don’t consider \"versions\" of GitHub.com, we receive\nincremental updates to the site and realize the benefits of GitHub’s on-going\ndevelopment without ever thinking about an \"upgrade.\"\n\nI believe Jenkins Evergreen can, and will provide that same experience.\n\nAutomatic Sane Defaults\n\nThe really powerful thing about Jenkins as a platform is the broad variety of\npatterns and practices different organizations may adopt. For newer users, or\nusers with common use-cases, that significant amount of flexibility can result\nin a paradox of choice. With Jenkins Evergreen, much of the most common\nconfiguration is automatically configured out of the box.\n\nIncluded is Jenkins Pipeline and Blue Ocean, by default. We also removed some\nlegacy functionalities from Jenkins while we were at it.\n\nWe are also utilizing some of the fantastic\nConfiguration as Code\nwork, which recently had its 1.0 release, to automatically set sane defaults in\nJenkins Evergreen.\n\nStatus Quo\n\nThe effort has made significant strides thus far this year, and we’re really\nexcited for people to start trying out Jenkins Evergreen. As of today,\nJenkins Evergreen\nis ready for early adopters. We do not yet recommend using Jenkins\nEvergreen for a production environment.\n\nIf you’re at DevOps World - Jenkins World in San Francisco please come see\nBaptiste’s talk Wednesday at 3:45pm in Golden Gate Ballroom A. Or\nmy talk at 11:15am in Golden Gate Ballroom B.\n\nIf you can’t join us here in San Francisco, we hope to hear your feedback and thoughts in our\nGitter channel!","title":"Continuously delivering an easy-to-use Jenkins with Evergreen","tags":["jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2018","evergreen"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
