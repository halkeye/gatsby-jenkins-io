The partnership comes\nat an important time, after the recent launch of Jenkins 2.0,\nJenkins users are more readily adopting Pipeline as\nCode and many other plugins at an increasing rate, elevating the importance of\nJenkins infrastructure to the overall success of the project. That strong and\ncontinued growth has brought new demands to our infrastructure’s design and\nimplementation, requiring the next step in its evolution. This partnership helps\nus grow with the rest of the project by unifying our existing infrastructure\nunder one comprehensive, modern and scalable platform.\n\nIn March we\ndiscussed\nthe potential partnership in our regularly scheduled\nproject\nmeeting,\nhighlighting some of the infrastructure challenges that we face:\n\nCurrently we have infrastructure in four different locations, with four\ndifferent infrastructure providers, each with their own APIs and tools for\nmanaging resources, each with varying capabilities and capacities.\n\nProject infrastructure is managed by a team of volunteers, operating\nmore than 15 different services and managing a number of additional external\nservices.\n\nOur current download/mirror network, while geographically distributed, is\nrelatively primitive and its implementation prevents us from using more modern\ndistribution best practices.\n\nIn essence, five years of tremendous growth for Jenkins has outpaced our\norganically grown, unnecessarily complex, project infrastructure. Migrating to\nAzure simplifies and improves our infrastructure in a dramatic way that would\nnot be possible without a comprehensive platform consisting of: compute, CDN,\nstorage and data-store services. Our partnership covers, at minimum, the next\nthree years of the project’s infrastructure needs, giving us a great home for\nthe future.\n\nAzure also enables a couple of projects that I\nhave long been dreaming of providing to Jenkins users and contributors:\n\nEnd-to-end TLS encrypted distribution of Jenkins packages, plugins and\nmetadata via the Azure CDN.\n\nMore complete build/test/release support and capacity on\nci.jenkins.io for plugin developers using\nAzure\nContainer Service and generic VMs.\n\nThe Jenkins infrastructure is all open\nsource which means  all of our Docker containers, Puppet code and many of our\ntools are all available on GitHub. Not\nonly can you watch the migration process to Azure as it happens, but I also\ninvite you to participate in making our project’s infrastructure better (join\nus in the #jenkins-infra channel on Freenode or our\nmailing list).\n\nSuffice it to say, I’m very excited about the bright [blue] future for the\nJenkins project and the infrastructure that powers it!","title":"Partnering with Microsoft to run Jenkins infrastructure on Azure","tags":["azure","infra","infrastructure"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

This has been a major milestone for\nJenkins and its growing community of developers, testers, designers and other\nusers in the software delivery process.\n\nWith its rising popularity and wide adoption, the Jenkins community continues to\ngrow and evolve into the millions. Jenkins community meetup activity has risen\nto an all time high since the first Jenkins meetup which was established on\nAugust 23 2010, in San Francisco.\n\nOver the last six months the number of\nJenkins Area Meetup (JAM) Groups has\ngrown from 5 to 30, with coverage in Asia, North America, South America and\nEurope.  That’s an average growth of 4 new JAMs per month.\n\nAs of today, there are over 4,100 Jenkins fans within the Jenkins meetup\ncommunity.  This is the result of contributions from community JAM leaders who\nhave volunteered their time to provide a platform for learning, sharing and\nnetworking all things Jenkins within their local communities.\n\nFor anyone who has not organized a meetup before, there are many moving parts\nthat have to come together at a specific location, date and time. This process\ntakes significant effort to methodically plan out. From planning the food and\nbeverages to securing speaker(s), a venue, audio/visual setup, technical\nlogistics and of course promoting the meetup. It does takes a level of passion\nand effort to make it all happen.\n\nMany THANKS to the 55 JAM leaders, who share this passion - they have\nsuccessfully organized over 41 meetups within the past six months in North\nAmerica, South America and Europe. That’s about 6 meetups a month!\n\nThere are still plenty of opportunities to be a JAM organizer. If there is not a\nJAM near you, we’d love to hear from\nyou!

Azure is Microsoft’s\npublic cloud offering and one of the many tools available to Jenkins users for\nadding elastic compute capacity, among other things, to their build/test/deploy\ninfrastructure. While our presentations are applicable to practically\nany cloud-based Jenkins environment, Thiago Almeida and Oguz Pastirmaci from\nMicrosoft were also on-hand and presented some interesting Azure-specific\nofferings like\nAzure\nContainer Service with Jenkins.\n\nWhile we do not have video from the meetup, Brian and I did record\na\nsession with Thiago and Oguz for Channel9\nwhich covers much of the same content:\n\nTo kick-off the meetup we asked attendees a few polling questions and\nreceived very telling responses:\n\nHow big is your Development/IT organization?\n\nWhat is your role?\n\nBy show of hands do you practice CI/CD/DevOps/etc?\n\nAt what scale (tooling and practice)?\n\nThe responses indicated that the majority of attendees were from small to medium\norganizations where they practiced Continuous Delivery across multiple teams. A\nnotable 25% or greater attendees considered themselves \"fullstack\" or\nparticipating in all of the roles of Developer, QA, and Operations. Interesting\nwhen paired with the high number (~80%) of those who practice CD.  This is\nlikely because modern teams, with mature CD practices, tend to blur the\ntraditional lines of Developer, QA and Operations. However, In my experience,\nwhile this is often the case for small to medium companies in large\norganizations team members tend to fall into the traditional roles, with CD\nproviding the practice and platform to unify teams across roles.\n\n— Brian Dawson\n\nAfter gauging the audience, Thiago and Brian reviewed Continuous Delivery (CD)\nand implementing it at scale. They highlighted the fact that CD is being rapidly\nadopted across teams and organizations, providing the ability: to deliver a demonstrably\nhigher quality product, shipping more rapidly than before, and to keep team members happier.\n\nHowever, when organizations fail to properly support CD as they scale, they run\ninto issues such as: developers acting as administrators at the cost of\nproductivity, potential lack of security and/or exposure of IP and difficulty in\nsharing best practices across teams.\n\nThiago then highlighted that properly scaling CD practices in the organization\nalong with the infrastructure itself can alleviate these issues, and discussed\nthe benefits of scaling CD to on cloud platforms to provide \"CD-as-a-Service.\"\n\nOverall I found the \"theory\" discussion to be on point, continuous delivery is\nnot just a technology nor a people problem. Successful organizations scale their\nprocesses and tooling together.\n\nThe slides from our respective presentations are linked below:\n\n(Brian) Scaling Jenkins for Continuous Delivery (.pdf)\n\n(Tyler) Scaling Jenkins with Azure (.pdf)\n\nI hope you join us at future\nSan Francisco\nJAM s!","title":"SF JAM Report: Scaling Jenkins for Continuous Delivery with Azure","tags":["jam","azure","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

For an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\n\nOne of the fixes may well break some of your use cases in Jenkins, at least until plugins have been adapted: SECURITY-170. This change removes parameters that are not defined on a job from the build environment. So, right now, a job could even be unparameterized, and plugins were able to pass parameters anyway. Since build parameters are added to the environment variables of scripts run during a build, parameters such as PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH can be defined — on jobs which don’t even expect those as build parameters — to change the behavior of builds.\n\nA number of plugins define additional parameters for builds. For example, GitHub Pull Request Builder passes a number of additional parameters describing the pull request. Release Plugin also allows adding several additional parameters to a build that are not considered to be defined in the job as part of this security fix.\n\nPlease see this wiki page for a list of plugins known to be affected by this change.\n\nUntil these plugins have been adapted to work with the new restriction (and advice on that is available further down), you can define the following system properties to work around this limitation, at least for a time:\n\nSet hudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters to true, e.g. java -Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters=true -jar jenkins.war to revert to the old behavior of allowing any build parameters. Depending on your environment, this may be unsafe, as it opens you up to attacks as described above.\n\nSet hudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters to a comma-separated list of safe parameter names, e.g. java -Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=FOO,BAR_baz,quX -jar jenkins.war.\n\nI realize this change, among a few others that improve the security of Jenkins, may be difficult to adapt for some, but given the valuable secrets typically stored in Jenkins, I’m certain that this is the correct approach. We made sure to release this fix with the options described above, so that this change doesn’t block updating those that rely on this behavior.\n\nDevelopers have several options to adapt to this change:\n\nParametersAction actually stores all parameters, but getParameters() only returns those that are defined on the job. The new method getAllParameters() returns all of them. This can be used, for example by EnvironmentContributor extensions, to add known safe parameters to build environments.\n\nDon’t pass extra arguments, but define a QueueAction for your metadata instead. Those can still be made available to the build environment as needed.\n\nSubscribe to the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list to receive important notifications related to Jenkins security.","title":"Security updates for Jenkins core","tags":["core","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and, as security officer, leads the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","id":"e79a5ee4-9a52-50ad-875a-d0e23f888bab","slug":"/blog/2016/05/10/jenkins-20-vjam/","strippedHtml":"Last week we hosted our first ever\nOnline JAM with the debut\ntopic of: Jenkins 2.0. Alyssa, our\nEvents officer, and I pulled together a\nseries of\nsessions focusing on some of the most notable aspects of Jenkins 2 with:\n\nA Jenkins 2.0 keynote from project founder\nKohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nAn overview of \"Pipeline as Code\" from Patrick\nWolf\n\nA deep-dive into Pipeline and related plugins like Multibranch, etc from\nJesse Glick and\nKishore Bhatia\n\nAn overview of new user experience changes in 2.0 from\nKeith Zantow\n\nA quick lightning talk about documentation by yours truly\n\nWrapping up the sessions, was Kohsuke again, talking about the road beyond\nJenkins 2.0 and what big projects he sees on the horizon.\n\nThe event was really interesting for me, and I hope informative for those who\nparticipated in the live stream and Q&A session. I look forward to hosting more\nVirtual JAM events in the future, and I hope you will\njoin us!\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nBelow are a collection of questions and answers, that were posed during the\nVirtual JAM. Many of these were answered during the course of the sessions, but\nfor posterity all are included below.\n\nPipeline\n\nWhat kind of DSL is used behind pipeline as code? Groovy or allow freely use\ndifferent languages as a user prefer?\n\nPipeline uses a Groovy-based domain specific language.\n\nHow do you test your very own pipeline DSL?\n\nReplay helps in testing/debugging while creating pipelines and at the branch\nlevel. There are some ideas which Jesse Glick\nhas proposed for testing Jenkinsfile and Pipeline libraries captured in\nJENKINS-33925.\n\nIsn’t \"Survive Jenkins restart\" exclusive to [CloudBees] Jenkins Enterprise?\n\nNo, this feature does not need\nCloudBees\nJenkins Enterprise. All features shown\nduring the virtual JAM are free and open source. CloudBees' Jenkins Enterprise\nproduct does support restarting from a specified stage however, and that is not\nopen source.\n\nHow well is jenkins 2.0 integrate with github for tracking job definitions?\n\nUsing the\nGitHub\nOrganization Folder plugin, Jenkins can automatically detect a Jenkinsfile in\nsource repositories to create Pipeline projects.\n\nPlease make the ability for re-run failed stages Open Source too :)\n\nThis has been passed on to our friends at CloudBees for consideration :)\n\nIf Jenkinsfile is in the repo, co-located with code, does this mean Jenkins can\nauto-detect new jobs for different branches?\n\nThis is possible using the\nPipeline Multibranch plugin.\n\nWhat documentation sources are there for Pipeline?\n\nOur documentation section contains a number of pagesaround Pipeline.\nThere is also additional documentation and examples in the plugin’s\ngit repository and the\njenkinsci/pipeline-examples\nrepository. (contributions welcome!)\n\nWhere we can find the DSL method documentation?\n\nThere is generated documentation on jenkins.io which\nincldues steps from all public plugins. Inside of a running Jenkins instance,\nyou can also navigate to\nJENKINS_URL/workflow-cps-snippetizer/dslReference\nto see the documentation for the plugins which are installed in that instance.\n\nIf Pipeline is not support some plugins (there is a lot actually), I needed\nSonarQube Runner but unfortunately it’s not supported yet, in Job DSL plugin i\ncan use \"Configure Block\" and cover any plugin via XML, how i can achieve the\nsame with a Pipeline?\n\nNot at this time\n\nIs there a possibility to create custom tooltips i.e. with a quick reference or\na link to internal project documentation? Might be useful i.e. for junior team\nmembers who need to refer to external docs.\n\nNot generally. Though in the case of Pipeline global libraries, you can create\ndescriptions of vars/functions like standardBuild in the demo, and these will\nappear in Snippet Generator under Global Variables.\n\nOh pipeline supports joining jobs? It’s really good, but I cannot find document\nat https://jenkins.io/doc/ could you tell me where is it?\n\nThere is a build step, but the Pipeline system is optimized for single-job\npipelines\n\nWe have multiple projects that we would like to follow the same pipeline.  How\nwould I write a common pipeline that can be shared across multiple projects.\n\nYou may want to look at implementing some additional steps using the\nPipeline Global\nLibrary feature. This would allow you to define\norganization-specific extensions to the Pipeline DSL to abstract away common\npatterns between projects.\n\nHow much flexibility is there with creating context / setting environment\nvariables or changing / modifying build tool options when calling a web hook /\napi to parameterize pipelines for example to target deployments to different env\nusing same pipeline\n\nVarious environment variables are exposed under the env variable in the Groovy\nDSL which would allow you to construct logic as simple or as complex as\nnecessary to achieve your goal.\n\nWhen you set up the job for the first time, does it build every branch in git,\nor is there a way to stop it from building old branches?\n\nNot at this time, the best way to prevent older branches from being built is to\nremove the Jenkinsfile in those branches. Alternatively, you could use the\n\"include\" or \"exclude\" patterns when setting up the SCM configuration of your\nmultibranch Pipeline. See also\nJENKINS-32396.\n\nSimilar to GitHub organizations, will BitBucket \"projects\" (ways of organizing\ncollections of repos) be supported?\n\nYes, these are supported via the\nBitbucket\nBranch Source plugin.\n\nHow do you handle build secrets with the pipeline plugin? Using unique\ncredentials stored in the credentials plugin per project and/or branch?\n\nThis can be accomplished by using the\nCredentials\nBinding plugin.\n\nSimilar to GitHub Orgs, are Gitlab projects supported in the same way?\n\nGitLab projects are not explicitly supported at this time, but the extension\npoints which the GitHub Organization Folder plugin uses could be extended in a\nsimilar manner for GitLab. See also JENKINS-34396\n\nIs Perforce scm supported by the Pipeline plugin?\n\nAs a SCM source for discovering a Jenkinsfile, not at this time. The\nP4\nplugin does provide some p4 steps which can be used in a Pipeline script\nhowever, see here for documentation.\n\nIs Mercurial supported with multibranch?\n\nYes, it is.\n\nCan Jenkinsfile detect when it’s running against a pull request vs an approved commit, so that it can perform a different type of build?\n\nYes, via the env variables provided in the DSL scope. Using an if statement,\none could guard specific behaviors with:\n\nif (env.CHANGE_ID != null) {\n    /* do things! */\n}\n\nLet’s say I’m building RPMs with Jenkins and use build number as an RPM\nversion/release number. Is there a way to maintain build numbers and leverage\nversioning of Jenkinsfile?\n\nThrough the env variable, it’s possible to utilize env.BUILD_NUMBER or the\nSCM commit ID, etc.\n\nLove the snippet generator! Any chance of separating it out from the pipeline\ninto a separate page on its own, available in the left nav?\n\nYes, this is tracked in\nJENKINS-31831\n\nAny tips on pre-creating the admin user credential and selecting plugins to\nautomate the Jenkins install?\n\nThere are various configuration\nmanagement modules which provide parts of this functionality.\n\nI’m looking at the pipeline syntax (in Jenkins 2.0) how do I detect a\nstep([…​]) has failed and create a notification inside the Jenkinsfile?\n\nThis can be done by wrapping a step invocation with a Groovy try/catch block.\nSee also JENKINS-28119\n\nUser Interface/Experience\n\nIs the user experience same as before when we replace the Jenkins.war(1.x to\n2.x) in an existing (with security in place) installation?\n\nYou will get the new UI features like redesigned configuration forms, but the\ninitial setup wizard will be skipped. In its stead, Jenkins will offer to\ninstall Pipeline-related functionality.\n\nIs it possible to use custom defined syntax highlighting ?\n\nWithin the Pipeline script editor itself, no. It is using the\nACE editor system,\nso it may be possible for a plugin to change the color scheme used.\n\nCan you elaborate on what the Blue Ocean UI is? Is there a link or more\ninformation on it?\n\nBlue Ocean is the name of user experience an design project, unfortunately at\nthis point in time there is not more information available on it.\n\nGeneral\n\nHow well this integrate with cloud environment?\n\nThe Jenkins controller and agents can run easily in any public cloud environment\nthat supports running Java applications. Through the\nEC2,\nJClouds,\nAzure, or\nany other plugins which extend the cloud\nextension\npoint, it is possible to dynamically provision new build agents on a configured\ncloud provider.\n\nAre help texts and other labels and messages updated for other localizations /\nlanguages as well?\n\nPractically every string in Jenkins core is localizable.

It is quite remarkable for a project that\noriginally started as a hobby project under a different name. I’m very proud.\n\nAround this time last year,\nwe’ve\ncelebrated 10 years, 1000 plugins, and 100K installations. That was a good time\nto retrospect, and we started thinking about the next 10 years of Jenkins and\nwhat’s necessary to meet that challenge.  This project has long been on a\nweekly \"train\" release model, so it was useful to step back and think about a\nbig picture.\n\nThat is where three pillars of Jenkins 2.0 have emerged from.\n\nFirst, one of the challenges our users are facing today is that the automation\nthat happens between a commit and a production has significantly grown in its\nscope. Because of this, the clothing that used to fit (aka \"freestyle project\",\nwhich was the workhorse of Jenkins) no longer fits. We now need something that\nbetter fits today’s use cases like \"continuous delivery pipeline.\" This is why\nin 2.0 we’ve added the pipeline capability. This 2 year old effort allows you\nto describe your chain of automation in a textual form. This allows you to\nversion control it, put it alongside your source tree, etc. It is also actually\na domain specific language (DSL) of Groovy, so when your pipeline grows in\ncomplexity/sophistication, you can manage its complexity and keep it\nunderstandable far more easily.\n\nSecond, over time, Jenkins has developed the \"assembly required before initial\nuse\" feeling. As the project has grown, the frontier of interesting development\nhas shifted to plugins, which is how it should be, but we have left it up to\nusers to discover & use them. As a result, the default installation became very\nthin and minimal, and every user has to find several plugins before Jenkins\nbecomes really functional. This created a paradox of choice and unnecessarily\nhurt the user experience. In 2.0, we reset this thinking and tried to create\nmore sensible out of the box experience that solves 80% use cases for 80% of\npeople. You get something useful out of the box, and you can get some\nconsiderable mileage out of it before you start feeling the need of plugins.\nThis allows us to focus our development & QA effort around this base\nfunctionality, too. By the way, the focus on the out of the box experience\ndoesn’t stop at functionality, either. The initial security setup of Jenkins is\nimproved, too, to prevent unprotected Jenkins instances from getting abused by\nbotnets and attacks.\n\nThird, we were fortunate to have a number of developers with UX background\nspend some quality time on Jenkins, and they have made a big dent in improving\nvarious parts of Jenkins web UI. The setup wizard that implements the out of\nthe box experience improvement is one of them, and it also includes other parts\nof Jenkins that you use all the time, such as job configuration pages and new\nitem pages. This brings much needed attention to the web UI.\n\nAs you can see, 2.0 brings a lot of exciting features on the table, but this is\nan evolutionary release, built on top of the same foundation, so that your\nexisting installations can upgrade smoothly. After this initial release, we’ll\nget back to our usual weekly release march.  Improvements will be made\nto those pillars and others in coming months and years continuously. If you’d\nlike to get a more in-depth look at Jenkins 2.0, please join us in our virtual\nJenkins meetup 2.0 launch event.\n\nThank you very much for everyone who made Jenkins 2.0 possible. There are\ntoo many of you\nto thank individually, but you know who you are. I wanted to thank CloudBees in\nparticular for sponsoring the time of many of those people. Ten years ago, all I\ncould utilize was my own night & weekend time. Now I’ve got a team of smart\npeople working with me to carry this torch forward, and a big effort like 2.0\nwouldn’t have been possible without such organized effort.","title":"Jenkins 2.0 is here!","tags":["jenkins2"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","id":"be010022-b98d-5767-afad-a1578cc4e23f","slug":"/blog/2016/04/22/possible-infra-compromise/","strippedHtml":"Last week, the infrastructure team identified the potential compromise of a key\ninfrastructure machine. This compromise could have taken advantage of, what\ncould be categorized as, an attempt to target contributors with elevated\naccess. Unfortunately, when facing the uncertainty of a potential compromise,\nthe safest option is to treat it as if it were an actual incident, and react\naccordingly. The machine in question had access to binaries published to our\nprimary and secondary mirrors, and to contributor account information.\n\nSince this machine is not the source of truth for Jenkins binaries, we verified\nthat the files distributed to Jenkins users: plugins, packages, etc, were not\ntampered with. We cannot, however, verify that contributor account information\nwas not accessed or tampered with and, as a proactive measure, we are issuing a\npassword reset for all contributor accounts. We have also spent significant effort\nmigrating all key services off of the potentially compromised machine to\n(virtual) hardware so the machine can be re-imaged or decommissioned entirely.\n\nWhat you should do now\n\nIf you have ever filed an issue in JIRA,\nedited a wiki page, released a plugin or\notherwise created an account via the Jenkins\nwebsite, you have a Jenkins community account. You should be receiving a\npassword reset email shortly, but if you have re-used your Jenkins account\npassword with other services we strongly encourage you to update your passwords\nwith those other services.  If you’re not already using one, we also encourage\nthe use of a password manager for generating and managing service-specific\npasswords.\n\nThe generated password sent out is temporary and will expire if you do not\nuse it to update your account. Once it expires you will need recover your\naccount with the password reset\nin the accounts app.\n\nThis does not apply to your own Jenkins installation, or any account that you\nmay use to log into it. If you do not have a Jenkins community account, there is\nno action you need to take.\n\nWhat we’re doing to prevent events like this in the future\n\nAs stated above, the potentially compromised machine is being removed from our\ninfrastructure. That helps address the immediate problem but doesn’t put\nguarantees in place for the future. To help prevent potential issues in the\nfuture we’re taking the following actions:\n\nIncorporating more security policy enforcement into our\nPuppet-driven infrastructure. Without a\nconfiguration management tool enforcing a given state for some legacy services,\nuser error and manual mis-configurations can adversely affect project security.\nAs of right now, all key services are managed by Puppet.\n\nBalkanizing our machine and permissions model more. The machine affected was\nliterally the first independent (outside of Sun) piece of project\ninfrastructure and like many legacy systems, it grew to host a multitude of\nservices. We are rapidly evolving away from that model with increasing levels\nof user and host separation for project services.\n\nIn a similar vein, we have also introduced a trusted zone in our\ninfrastructure which is not routable on the public internet, where sensitive\noperations, such as generating update center information, can be managed and\nsecured more effectively.\n\nWe are performing an infrastructure permissions audit. Some portions of our\ninfrastructure are 6+ years old and have had contributors come and go. Any\ninactive users with unnecessarily elevated permissions in the project\ninfrastructure will have those permissions revoked.\n\nI would like to extend thanks, on behalf of the Jenkins project, to\nCloudBees for their help in funding and\nmigrating this infrastructure.\n\nIf you have further questions about the Jenkins project infrastructure, you can\njoin us in the #jenkins-infra channel on Freenode\nor in an Infrastructure Q&A session I’ve scheduled for next Wednesday (April\n27) at 20:00 UTC (12:00 PST).","title":"Possible Jenkins Project Infrastructure Compromise","tags":["infra","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Besides aligning better with the upcoming Jenkins 2.0 core release, the plugins are now being released with independent lifecycles.\n\n“Pipeline 1.15” (the last in the 1.x line) included simultaneous releases of a dozen or so plugins with the 1.15 version number (and 1.15+ dependencies on each other). All these plugins were built out of a single workflow-plugin repository. While that was convenient in the early days for prototyping wide-ranging changes, it has become an encumbrance now that the Pipeline code is fairly mature, and more people are experimenting with additions and patches.\n\nAs of 2.0, all the plugins in the system live in their own repositories on GitHub—named to match the plugin code name, which in most cases uses the historical workflow term, so for example workflow-job-plugin. Some complex steps were moved into their own plugins, such as pipeline-build-step-plugin. The 1.x changelog is closed; now each plugin keeps a changelog in its own wiki, for example here for the Pipeline Job plugin.\n\nAmong other benefits, this change makes it easier to cut new plugin releases for even minor bug fixes or enhancements, or for developers to experiment with patches to certain plugins. It also opens the door for the “aggregator” plugin (called simply Pipeline) to pull in dependencies on other plugins that seem broadly valuable, like the stage view.\n\nThe original repository has been renamed pipeline-plugin and for now still holds some documentation, which might later be moved to jenkins.io.\n\nYou need not do anything special to “move” to the 2.x line; 1.642.x and later users can just accept all Pipeline-related plugin updates. Note that if you update Pipeline Supporting APIs you must update Pipeline, or at least install/update some related plugins as noted in the wiki.","title":"Pipeline 2.x plugins","tags":["pipeline","jenkins2"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"jglick","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jesse has been developing Jenkins core and plugins for years.\nHe is the coauthor with Kohsuke of the core infrastructure of the Pipeline system.</p>\n</div>","id":"jglick","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Jesse Glick","slug":"/blog/authors/jglick","twitter":"tyvole"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":408,"numPages":100,"currentPage":52}},
