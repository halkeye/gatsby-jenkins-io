We found that some submitted stories were far too big to be constrained by our format of 'background/goal/solution/results.'\n\nSome Jenkins users had a much more complex story to tell, whether it was about getting upper management to buy-in, keeping developers happy, or simply making sure pipelines weren’t just bottlenecks in disguise.\n\nHere are a handful of Jenkins Case Studies we’ve published in the past few months, with many more on the way!\n\nCase Study #1: D4Science\n\nAmping up scientific research with CI/CD powered by Jenkins\n\nTo promote open science practices and support scientific communities while serving 11k registered users in 45 countries, D4Science introduced a new delivery pipeline that replaced their pre-existing build platform.\n\nOf course, they had to build and release their software framework (gCube) in a way that would support multi-project releases at scale — from 200+ Git repositories within the same day! It had to be fast, automate all release activities, and it had to deliver incremental releases to address user requirements quickly. Most of all, the solution had to be cost-effective.\n\nUsing Jenkins, they created an innovative approach to software delivery: a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, scalable, easy to maintain, and upgradable at a minimal cost.\n\nDiscover how D4Science empowers e-Science and virtual research communities with software released via Jenkins. Read the Jenkins case study featuring D4Science here!\n\nCase Study #2: Gainsight\n\nHumanizing CSX with tech innovation and a robust DevSecOps platform\n\nGainsight’s customer service experience platform helps customer success teams at more than 100 leading IT and healthcare clients. How? By driving engagement for tens of thousands of their customers.\n\nThat’s why the engineering team at Gainsight approached the customer experience by building a smarter, faster DevSecOps platform using Jenkins. They stuck to an infrastructure-as-code approach while integrating various tools and programming languages all within the platform. And they secured processes with better visibility and air-tight quality control.\n\nThe result was a flexible DevSecOps infrastructure, 95% of which is scalable with code. And the cost of infrastructure costs was 40% less. That provides Gainsight with ease of collaboration, keener operational insight, and — because builds are 30% faster — the ability to stay a step ahead of the competition.\n\nRead why Gainsight’s lead DevOps engineer, Prudviraj Pentakota, says \"Jenkins is the epicenter of DevSecOps in our organization.\" Get the full story here.\n\nCase Study #3: Avoris Travel\n\nReinventing travel with an inventive technology platform\n\nPart of Barceló Group, Ávoris Travel is behind prominent destination travel brands like LeSki, Le Musik, and a selection of author travels under its \"Viagens Com Assinatura\" signature travel concept. A proprietary database and a smart, dynamic booking engine are the tickets to offering differentiating and inventive travel opportunities.\n\nAlso unique to Avoris is a discreet machining technology that enables agents to enter specific criteria to search and find all types of trips and travel opportunities across the entire network.\n\n\"Our infrastructure is very important because we have to be online to meet customer demand anywhere in the world,\" said Alejandro Alvarez Vazquez, Sysadmin, Avoris Travel. \"Our CI/CD platform is used by 200 people. The services that we build and deploy are used by thousands of potential clients and by our network of 675 own agencies located in Spain and Portugal.\"\n\nRead the case study to learn how the flexibility of Jenkins plugins helped Avoris reduce build times by over 50% and became a go-to, scalable infrastructure supporting 675 agencies and over 2.8 million international consumers.\n\nWhat’s your story?\n\nWe want to know what you’re building with Jenkins and would love to post your case study on our\"Jenkins Is The Way\" website, a global showcase of how developers and engineers build, deploy, and automate great stuff with Jenkins.\n\nThe best way to get started is to share your Jenkins User story with us. We’ll send you a free Jenkins Is The Way T-Shirt in return and publish your account for the entire Jenkins community to see. And if it’s selected for a Case Study, we’ll be in touch for a one-on-one interview! Hope to hear from you soon!","title":"3 Cases: Jenkins success stories from the

is the world’s leading open-source automation server used by companies large and small around the globe to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery.\nKubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.\nKubernetes is compatible with the majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests, deploy builds in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.\nOne of the most popular CI/CD tools now is Jenkins thereby making Jenkins on Kubernetes a popular theme for Jenkins users.\n\nDuring the Google Season Of Docs program, I worked with the Jenkins organization on the project - Document Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nThe original proposal for this project can be found here.\n\nProject Goals\n\nAfter my proposal was accepted by the Jenkins organization, my mentors and I agreed on the expectations for the Google Season of Docs project.\nThe goal of this project was to create a new Kubernetes Volume which would describe the concepts, techniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins thereby providing the following advantages:\n\nImprove the user experience of Jenkins on Kubernetes users by giving them a one-stop-shop for information on Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nMake it easy to track, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nReference the existing community documentation for Jenkins on K8s (plugins and tools/integrations).\n\nHow to guides, tutorials and explanations of concepts and techniques in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nJust-In-Time documentation which means that rather than documenting every feature comprehensively, we produce and release documentation in bits but continuously based on popular questions, feedback and area of interests gathered from the community and users.\n\nCommunity Bonding: Planning the solution\n\nFind below an outline of my activities during the community bonding phase:\n\nSetting up communication channels: meetings, mailings, chats: My mentors and I agreed on the right time and channel for communication due to time difference.\nWe agreed to meet twice weekly, on Mondays and Thursdays at 7:00 PM GMT +1 and use Jenkins documentation gitter channel for other communications.\n\nContacting Stakeholders and onboarding contributors: The project was  announced on social media and different Jenkins channels.\nI wrote a blog post to announce the project and created a project page on Jenkins.io.\n\nKnowledge transfer: I and my mentors planned knowledge sharing sessions and fixed tentative dates based on the availability of the trainers.\nMy mentors also shared useful resources to help me prepare for the project.\n\nGetting permissions: I and my mentors agreed I didn’t need any special permissions from the beginning, however, this topic was left open for discussion if the need arose later on in the project.\n\nPre-planning of the project: I refined my goals and set expectations with my mentor and also learned more about the community(Jenkins).\nI also had to ensure that the proposed documentation structure I drafted was in line with the goals of the organization so my mentors vetted it and we finalized on the proposed sections that I was supposed to work on.\n\nDocumentation Development Phase\n\nKnowledge Sharing Sessions\n\nDuring the development phase, my mentors hosted two knowledge sharing sessions:\n\nKatacoda and Helm by Marky Jackson\n\nSee the slides\n\nHelm by Torsten Walter\n\nSee the slides\n\nThese sessions gave me an in-depth understanding of concepts and tools needed for the project.\n\nJenkins on Kubernetes Documentation Skeleton\n\nAt the application phase, I drafted a structure describing the proposed Jenkins on Kubernetes section.\nMy intention was to use it as a guide during the implementation phase of the project, but when the development phase kicked off, my mentors and I thought of a better approach to creating a new Jenkins on Kubernetes section which was to add the Jenkins on Kubernetes contents to existing related sections for easier navigation and better user experience.\nAn example of this approach would be creating the Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes section under the Installing Jenkins section rather than putting it under an entirely new section.\nWith this new approach, I was assigned a task to create a skeleton with all the proposed Jenkins on Kubernetes sections on Jenkins.io and mark these sections as\nWork In Progress (WIP).\nThe Plan was to use this skeleton as a guide throughout the GSOD Project.\nThe Jenkins on Kubernetes skeleton PR can be found here.\n\nDocumenting Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nWhile working on this project, I had to do a lot of research and test all the documented steps locally before pushing the documentation out for review.\nI also made sure to use updated terms and terminologies where necessary like Controller instead of Master and Agents instead of Slave.\n\nDuring the documentation phase, I was able to work on documenting Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes with three sections Helm, Set of Yaml files and Jenkins Operator.\nI also worked on creating a directory for Jenkins on kubernetes sample files in Jenkins.io repository, documenting Scaling Jenkins on Kubernetes and Jenkins on AWS which is still in progress.\n\nWork Done\n\nPull Requests : All the pull requests I submitted to Jenkins.io documentation can be found here.\nThis spreadsheet contains links to the published documentation on Jenkins.io.\nThe spreadsheet also highlights the initial proposed tasks and the status of each of them.\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes documentation, you can check out pending tasks here and reach out in the Jenkins documentation gitter channel.\n\nChallenges\n\nUsing a Windows computer was a bit of a challenge for me.\nTo run Jenkins.io locally, the project uses GNU/Make and Docker in order to generate the fully statically generated jenkins.io web site.\nThe key tool for converting source code into the site is the Awestruct static site generator, which is downloaded automatically as part of the build process.\nTo achieve this, I needed to have GNU/Make and Docker available on my machine.\nDocker was not a problem, but to achieve the latter, I needed to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\nWSL had two versions WSL1 and WSL2. Using WSL2 would have been much more convenient, but my version of windows wasn’t compatible with WSL2 as it required Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher for x64 systems.\nWith this obstacle, I had to stick to making WSL1 work but I still couldn’t get this to work, a series of issues came up which I was able to pass through with the help of my mentors until I got stuck at permission issues.\nI raised the issue with my mentor and after looking through the issue with me and trying to solve it to no avail, he suggested setting up an Ubuntu VM in Hyper-V.\nThis article helped me achieve this and that solved my problem.\n\nWhat did I learn?\n\nI learned a lot more about the Jenkins project, Kubernetes, helm package manager, Jenkins Operator and much more.\nThis project also gave me the opportunity to work with cloud providers like AWS which was totally new to me and also learn from field experts through knowledge sharing sessions and weekly meetings with my mentors and org admin.\nMy technical writing skill and communication skill have definitely become better and I owe it to this project.\n\nOverall, contributing to the Jenkins.io project is an amazing experience for me.\nI have been using Jenkins, and the fact that I was able to contribute to the organization and collaborate with the community is an honor.","title":"GSOD Project Report: Document Jenkins on Kubernetes","tags":["kubernetes","helm","documentation","gsod","gsod2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"zaycodes","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Zainab is a software developer and technical writer who is passionate about contributing to open source, improving technical documentation and advocating for gender diversity in open source collaboration.

Tyler Croy who step down from the Jenkins Governance Board this year.\nThanks to them for all contributions and for continued community leadership.\n\nStatement from Marky Jackson:\n\nIt is a tremendous honor to be elected to this roles. I am so humbled.\nBeing part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.\nMy goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.\nI look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.\n\n— Marky Jackson, Jenkins Governance Board Member and Events Officer\n\nStatement from Gavin Mogan:\n\nGavin here. I’m still in shock that I got voted in for the Jenkins board.\nIt felt like yesterday I just got started helping people randomly on IRC. This is truly exciting.\nI plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.\nThis is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.\nMy specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.\n\n— Gavin Mogan, Jenkins Governance Board Member\n\nOfficer election details\n\nAll 5 officer positions were up for election this year.\nThese roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2021.\nAfter the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,\n4 officer positions were uncontested:\n\nOlivier Vernin - Infrastructure officer.\n\nMarky Jackson - Events officer.\nMarky inherits this role from Alyssa Tong\nwho decided to step down from the officer role and to focus on the Jenkins community marketing,\nincluding Jenkins Is The Way and many other initiatives started by Alyssa.\n\nMark Waite - Documentation officer.\n\nDaniel Beck - Security officer.\n\nThanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!\nOfficers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.\nIt requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.\n\nRelease Officer election results\n\nTim Jacomb won the biggest support as a Release officer ( voting results).\nTim will replace in this role Oliver Gondža\nwho has been leading the Release Team and the release processes since 2016 when the role was officially introduced.\n\nTim Jacomb (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nBaptiste Mathus  loses to Tim Jacomb by 40–23\n\nVictor Martinez  loses to Tim Jacomb by 38–25, loses to Baptiste Mathus by 32–31\n\nHere is a statement from Tim Jacomb:\n\nI’m excited for the year ahead, let’s see where we can take the Jenkins release area in the future.\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation, ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team,\nand ensure that responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.\n\n— Tim Jacomb, Jenkins Release Officer\n\nThanks to Alyssa Tong and Oliver Gondža for their long-time service as Jenkins officers!\nWe are looking to continue working with them in the Jenkins community.\nAnd congratulations to Tim Jacomb and Marky Jackson for joining the team!\n\nStatistics\n\nThis year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.\nIt is significantly lower than in the 2019 elections when we had almost 350 voters.\nIt can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.\nThis year we decided to not use the previous voter registration system,\nand we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.\nThis is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nThe last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.\nWith help of many contributors and with the renewed board,\nwe have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,\nfor example hosting contributor summits,\npublishing the public roadmap,\nCode of Conduct update,\nterminology changes,\nand graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.\nThere is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.\n\nIn short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.\n\nThere are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:\nlong-anticipated features and architecture changes,\nchanging the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process,\ncreating better communication channels with Jenkins users,\nand onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to contribute!\n\nFeedback\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe will appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process so that we can improve the process.\nWe have started a Retrospective document for these elections.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\nThere will be also a public retrospective review at the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meeting on Dec 17.\n\nIf you have any private feedback you would like to share,\nplease send an email to the Jenkins Board.\nIf you would like to raise any issues about the election process,\nplease contact one of the elected Governance Board members.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2020 election

we have selected Jenkins 2.263 as a new baseline for the LTS release line, with ETA in December 2020.\nIt allows delivering significant and in some cases breaking changes which have been previously on hold.\nBeginning with the Jenkins 2.264 release on October 27, 2020, we’ve entered a period where the Jenkins weekly releases will include more significant changes than usual.\nThat period of more significant changes is expected to continue for a month or more.\nAs you may have seen from the release community ratings, there might be regressions and instabilities during this period.\n\nWe’re excited for the changes.\nThey help to improve user experience and to address the technical debt accumulated in the Jenkins core.\nWe invite Jenkins users to evaluate those changes and provide feedback.\nThis is an especially valuable time for users and administrators to test the weekly releases and report issues with them,\nespecially on Jenkins test environments.\nIn the Jenkins project we have invested a lot in test coverage for the main functionality,\nbut in many cases we rely on user feedback for exotic plugins and environments not yet covered by our test automation.\n\nThe most notable changes include:\n\nConfiguration UI - Tables to Divs\n\nCore - Spring Security replaces Acegi Security\n\nCore - XStream unfork\n\nUI - JQuery upgrade\n\nConfiguration UI - Tables to Divs\n\nJenkins 2.264 is the first weekly release to include the \"Tables to Divs migration\" user interface work of Josh Soref, Tim Jacomb, and Felix Queiruga.\nIt is a significant step to improve forms in the Jenkins user interface (configuration pages, build parameters, etc.), especially for users on narrow devices like tablets and phones.\n\nA better user interface\n\nThe transition from using HTML table tags to using HTML div tags provides a more attractive user interface for all users and a much better experience for users on narrower devices.\nBefore the conversion from table tags to div tags, the\"Manage Jenkins\" page looked like this in a 1024x768 window:\n\nAfter the conversion, the\"Manage Jenkins\" page now looks like this:\n\nThe user interface improvements from the transition are a nice step forward for Jenkins.\nHowever, because the user interface improvements require changes in plugins, we need your help.\n\nWe need users to test the latest weekly Jenkins releases with the plugins and configurations that are most important to them.\nWhen users detect an issue, we need them to report the issue with enough detail that a plugin maintainer can fix the issue.\nPlease add the tables-to-divs-regression label to the issues.\nThe tables-to-divs-regression label makes it easier to find issues related to the tables to divs transition.\n\nPlugin developers\n\nSeveral plugins have already been identified that may need changes.\nSee the Jira epic for plugins that are likely to need changes for the new user interface layout.\nThe list of open tables-to-divs-regression issues can also be used to see plugins that need changes.\n\nIf you can assist with plugin testing and code changes, select one of the plugins from that epic, test it, and propose a pull request to help with this user interface transition.\nIf you’re not comfortable proposing a pull request, describe the problems you see in a bug report.\n\nA tables to divs migration guide is available.\nIt describes areas that typically need to be changed as part of the migration from tables to divs.\nIt also includes detailed examples that allow the plugin to continue supporting older Jenkins versions with table layouts and use div layouts for newer Jenkins versions.\n\nCore - Spring Security replaces Acegi Security\n\nThe Jenkins 2.266 release on November 10, 2020 will include the migration to the Spring Security libraries from the Acegi security libraries that Jesse Glick has proposed and developed through jep:227[Jenkins Enhancement Proposal 227].\n\nThis upgrade replaces the Acegi Security library with the current release of the Spring Security library.\nDetails of the change are described in jep:227[] and in the pull request.\n\nWe need users to test the latest Jenkins weekly releases with their plugins and watch for issues related to authentication.\n\nRefer to Jesse Glick’s blog post that introduces the details of the change and provides links to the Spring Security compatibility table.\nJesse’s blog post provides specific instructions for those who report bugs related to this change.\nPlease use those instructions as you submit bug reports related to the Spring Security upgrade.\n\nCore - XStream unfork\n\nJenkins has been using a fork of the XStream serialization library to read and write XML files.\nThe XStream library was forked over 10 years ago and had a few fixes applied to it.\nUnfortunately, at that time the fixes were rejected by the upstream maintainers of XStream (unsupported patterns of API use) and the fork fell behind the upstream version.\n\nThe Jenkins 2.266 release on November 10, 2020 will include the migration to the upstream version of the XStream library that Jesse Glick has proposed and developed through jep:228[Jenkins Enhancement Proposal 228].\n\nRefer to Jesse Glick’s blog post that introduces the details of the change and provides links to the XStream compatibility table.\nJesse’s blog post provides specific instructions for those who report bugs related to this change.\nPlease use those instructions as you submit bug reports related to the XStream upgrade.\n\nUI - JQuery upgrade\n\nJenkins uses a 1.x version of the jQuery user interface library for some of its components.\nFelix Queiruga has started the work to update that library to a current jQuery version.\n\nIt will arrive in a future Jenkins weekly release.\nWhen it arrives, it will be noted in the Jenkins weekly changelog.\n\nWhen the jQuery update arrives, We will need users to test the Jenkins weekly release with the plugins and configurations that are most important to them.\nWhen users detect an issue, we need them to report the issue with enough detail that a plugin maintainer can fix the issue.\n\nCall to test\n\nThis is a great time to help the Jenkins project by testing the weekly releases.\nWe encourage you to test the user interface and the interactions that are most important to you.\nIf you find an issue, please report the issue so that others can benefit from your discovery.","title":"Jenkins 2.264+: Major changes in the weekly release

up technical debt is a perennial topic among Jenkins core developers,\nand one of the most visible issues is the use of obsolete and/or forked third-party libraries.\nIn a world where Dependabot is offering updates to libraries released just hours before,\nit is unpleasant to be working with dependencies that are many years old.\nSince large organizations in particular are unhappy to install software using obsolete or nonstandard versions,\nmy employer (CloudBees) gave its blessing for me to spend some time cleaning up some of the worst offenders.\n\nThe toughest nut to crack was the Acegi Security library used for authentication,\nwhich has long since been replaced by Spring Security\n(and Jenkins was also bundling a long-outdated version of some Spring Framework dependencies).\njep:227[] tracks the complicated task of updating to Spring Security\nwithout breaking the numerous plugins that interact with authentication,\nespecially those offering a Security Realm.\n\nAnother longstanding problem was the XStream library which Jenkins uses to read and write XML configuration files.\nThis had been forked long ago by what was then the Hudson project and a few fixes applied.\nUnfortunately, some of those fixes were rejected upstream as invalid (representing unsupported usage patterns),\nand the fork fell behind the upstream version.\njep:228[] describes the impact of switching to the upstream library in a more standard usage mode,\nincluding fixes to a smaller number of plugins which would otherwise be incompatible.\n\nNow that the Jenkins 2.266 weekly release includes both updates,\nit is important for both Jenkins administrators and plugin maintainers to check for actual or potential incompatibilities.\nThere are two tables listing the impact of these changes on plugins:\n\nSpring Security compatibility\n\nXStream compatibility\n\nIf you use Jenkins then it is a good idea before upgrading to take a look at these tables\nto see if you are running any plugins considered incompatible.\nIf so, try not to rely on that plugin, or find out if there is an active maintainer who could help.\nFor entries marked unknown, it would be appreciated if you could do a sanity check after upgrading\nand offer a pull request to the table page (click Edit this file) with a more informative status.\n\nIf you find a regression in a plugin, please file a bug report in Jira and link to it from the table.\nAlso please add a JEP-227 or JEP-228 label as appropriate, for ease of tracking:\n\nOpen JEP-227 issues\n\nOpen JEP-228 issues\n\nIt is a good idea to update all your plugins before upgrading Jenkins core.\nIn the case of the Spring Security update, some security realm plugins including LDAP and Active Directory must be updated in advance.\n(You can safely run the new plugin versions on Jenkins releases prior to this change.)\nOtherwise, you risk being unable to log in to Jenkins—and thus unable to update those plugins from the GUI!\nThe LDAP plugin additionally has a new version available only after the core upgrade, but there is no rush in switching to that.\n\nIf you maintain a Jenkins plugin then please check whether it is marked anything less than compatible.\nIn some cases, there are already pull requests awaiting merge.\nIn other cases, some minor aspects of the source code have been identified that could be edited to improve compatibility.\n\nWe expect to see a bit of disruption from these changes\nbut hope that in the long run they will save time for core and plugin developers\nand lead to a more secure and stable tool.\nPlease reach out on the developers’ list with any questions or suggestions.","title":"Spring and XStream updates (breaking

are super excited to announce that the Document Jenkins on Kubernetes Project recently merged its first PR into Jenkins.io.\nThis PR adds a new Kubernetes section to the existing Installing Jenkins chapter of Jenkins.io.\n\nThis new section describes two options to install/run Jenkins on Kubernetes, how to setup a minikube cluster on which to run your Jenkins deployment and finally a bonus segment that explains some Post-installation setups such as unlocking Jenkins, customizing Jenkins with plugins and creating your first administrator user.\n\nThe first installation option covered in this section is helm a package manager for Kubernetes whose package format is called a chart. The helm section covers the prerequisites for installing Jenkins on Kubernetes using Helm, installing and configuring helm, creating a persistent volume and service account, and finally, Installing Jenkins.\n\nThe second option describes how to install Jenkins using a set of yaml files.\nThis section explains how to create a Jenkins deployment file, Deploy Jenkins, grant access to jenkins service, and finally access your Jenkins dashboard after installation.\n\nSplitting the Installing Jenkins Chapter\n\nThe addition of the Kubernetes section highlighted a long-standing challenge with the Installing Jenkins chapter.\nIt was too long and contained too many topics, making it difficult and unpleasant for\nmost users to navigate.\nTo top the icing on the cake and further improve the experience on Jenkins documentation users, another PR was merged into Jenkins.io to split the Installing Jenkins chapter into smaller chapters for better separation of concerns and easy navigation. This PR also redirects bookmarks that linked to the previous locations like https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/#debianubuntu using Javascript.\n\nThe image above is a snapshot of what the Installing Jenkins chapter looked like before the PR.\nAll sections of this chapter such as docker, Kubernetes and others were lumped up on the same page making it too long with so much information thereby making it difficult to navigate or even find information on this page.\n\nThis snapshot shows what the Installing Jenkins chapter looks like after the PR.\nWith this chapter split into smaller sections, it’s neater, clearer and most importantly easier to navigate to the section of interest without having to scroll through so much information that’s not necessarily needed.\n\nTesting, Participating and Contributing\n\nThe Jenkins Community invites the general public to try out these documentation updates and give feedback to help us further improve the documentation.\nIf you have any feedback, suggestions, or would like to contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes project,  drop a message indicating your interest in the Jenkins documentation Gitter channel.\nYou can also find the Google season of docs office hour notes and recordings for Jenkins on Kubernetes here.\nGSOD office hours take place twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays between 6 pm GMT+1 and 7 pm GMT+1, if you would like to be part of these meetings, you can indicate interest in the Jenkins Documentation Gitter channel and we would be happy to have you.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nInstalling Jenkins on Kubernetes PR\n\nSplitting Installing Jenkins Chapter PR\n\nDocument Jenkins on Kubernetes Project\n\nGSoD Proposal\n\nGSoD Office Hours Notes\n\nGoogle Season of Docs - Startup\n\nGoogle Season of Docs on jenkins.io\n\nDocs SIG for Google Season of Docs startup ( video)","title":"Document Jenkins on Kubernetes: Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes Documentation Release","tags":["kubernetes","helm","documentation","gsod","gsod2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"zaycodes","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Zainab is a software developer and technical writer who is passionate about contributing to open source, improving technical documentation and advocating for gender diversity in open source collaboration.
