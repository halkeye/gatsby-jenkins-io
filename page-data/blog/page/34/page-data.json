The Blue Ocean user interface ties these features together in a clean, modern UI.\n\nBuilding Android Apps\n\nTo build an Android app, you need the Java development tools (JDK), which Jenkins can automatically install for you, plus the Android SDK, which you can also install on individual build agents using a tool installer, or you can use a Docker container with the Android SDK Tools preinstalled, for example.\n\nThen, you can use your SCM plugin of choice to fetch your source code, and build the app using the Android Gradle Plugin via the Gradle Wrapper — in most cases this is as simple as running./gradlew assembleDebug.\n\nOnce your app has been built and packaged into a.apk file, you can use the archiveArtifacts build step, storing the APK, enabling colleagues to download APKs directly from Jenkins, so that they can try out the latest build.\n\nTesting Android Apps\n\nThe Android SDK supports two types of test: unit tests, which run on the JVM, and instrumentation tests, which have to run on an Android device or emulator.  Both types of test can be executed using Jenkins and, since the Android Gradle Plugin writes the test results to disk in JUnit XML format, the JUnit Plugin for Jenkins can be used to parse the results, enabling you see a test report, and to be notified of test failures.\n\nCompiling and executing the unit tests for your app is as simple as adding another build step which runs./gradlew testDebugUnitTest.\n\nSimilarly, instrumentation tests can be compiled and executed via the connectedDebugAndroidTest task in Gradle.  However, before you do this, you should ensure that an Android device is connected to your Jenkins build agent, or you can make use of the Android Emulator Plugin to automatically download, create, and start an emulator for you during a build.  There are also plugins for cloud testing services such as AWS Device Farm.\n\nOnce you have finished executing the tests, you can use the junit step to analyse the results: junit '**/TEST-*.xml'.\n\nStatic Analysis\n\nSimilar to other Java or Kotlin projects, you can scan your codebase using static analysis tools like FindBugs or Checkstyle.  Once again, Jenkins has analysis plugins which can parse the output of these tools, and present you with the results and trend graphs, or optionally flag the build as unstable or failed if too many problems have been detected.\n\nThe Android SDK provides a further useful static analysis tool called Lint.  The output of this tool can be parsed by the Warnings Next Generation Plugin, which will analyse the issues found, and provide you with a detailed report within Jenkins.  This functionality was demonstrated by the Android Tools Team at the Google I/O conference a few years back.\n\nSecurely signing and deploying Android apps\n\nIn order to distribute an Android app, it needs to be signed with a private key, which you should keep safe (losing it means you won’t be able to publish updates to your app!), and as secure as possible.\n\nInstead of developers having to keep the signing keystore on their development machines, you can securely store the keystore and/or its passphrase on Jenkins using the Credentials Plugin.  This avoids having to hardcode the passphrase into your build.gradle, or have it otherwise checked into your SCM.\n\nThe Credentials Plugin allows you to store secrets in Jenkins — which will be stored encrypted on disk when not in use — and those secrets can temporarily be made available during a build, either as a file in the build workspace, or exposed as an environment variable.\n\nYou can use such environment variables in a signingConfig block within your build.gradle, or you can make use of the Android Signing Plugin to sign your APK for you.\n\nOnce you have your production-ready APK built and signed, you can automatically upload it to Google Play using the Google Play Android Publisher plugin.  The benefit of using this plugin is that it supports multiple APK upload, expansion files, uploading of ProGuard mapping files, promotion of builds from alpha, to beta, to production — and once again, your Google Play credentials are securely stored on Jenkins thanks to integration with the Credentials Plugin.\n\nSample Pipeline\n\nHere’s a straightforward example of a Jenkinsfile defining a pipeline to build, test, and optionally deploy an Android app, from a multibranch Pipeline job.\nIt requires the Pipeline, JUnit, Android Lint, Google Play Android Publisher, and Mailer plugins to be installed.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\npipeline {\n  agent {\n    // Run on a build agent where we have the Android SDK installed\n    label 'android'\n  }\n  options {\n    // Stop the build early in case of compile or test failures\n    skipStagesAfterUnstable()\n  }\n  stages {\n    stage('Compile') {\n      steps {\n        // Compile the app and its dependencies\n        sh './gradlew compileDebugSources'\n      }\n    }\n    stage('Unit test') {\n      steps {\n        // Compile and run the unit tests for the app and its dependencies\n        sh './gradlew testDebugUnitTest'\n\n        // Analyse the test results and update the build result as appropriate\n        junit '**/TEST-*.xml'\n      }\n    }\n    stage('Build APK') {\n      steps {\n        // Finish building and packaging the APK\n        sh './gradlew assembleDebug'\n\n        // Archive the APKs so that they can be downloaded from Jenkins\n        archiveArtifacts '**/*.apk'\n      }\n    }\n    stage('Static analysis') {\n      steps {\n        // Run Lint and analyse the results\n        sh './gradlew lintDebug'\n        androidLint pattern: '**/lint-results-*.xml'\n      }\n    }\n    stage('Deploy') {\n      when {\n        // Only execute this stage when building from the `beta` branch\n        branch 'beta'\n      }\n      environment {\n        // Assuming a file credential has been added to Jenkins, with the ID 'my-app-signing-keystore',\n        // this will export an environment variable during the build, pointing to the absolute path of\n        // the stored Android keystore file.  When the build ends, the temporarily file will be removed.\n        SIGNING_KEYSTORE = credentials('my-app-signing-keystore')\n\n        // Similarly, the value of this variable will be a password stored by the Credentials Plugin\n        SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD = credentials('my-app-signing-password')\n      }\n      steps {\n        // Build the app in release mode, and sign the APK using the environment variables\n        sh './gradlew assembleRelease'\n\n        // Archive the APKs so that they can be downloaded from Jenkins\n        archiveArtifacts '**/*.apk'\n\n        // Upload the APK to Google Play\n        androidApkUpload googleCredentialsId: 'Google Play', apkFilesPattern: '**/*-release.apk', trackName: 'beta'\n      }\n      post {\n        success {\n          // Notify if the upload succeeded\n          mail to: 'beta-testers@example.com', subject: 'New build available!', body: 'Check it out!'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  post {\n    failure {\n      // Notify developer team of the failure\n      mail to: 'android-devs@example.com', subject: 'Oops!', body: \"Build ${env.BUILD_NUMBER} failed; ${env.BUILD_URL}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNot just for Android\n\nWhile buddybuild concentrated on Android and iOS apps, thanks to the distributed build agent architecture of Jenkins, you can automate any type of project.\n\nFor example, you can expand the capabilities of Jenkins by adding macOS (or Windows, Linux, BSD…) agents; you can dynamically spin up agents on AWS EC2 instances, Microsoft Azure VMs, or Azure Container Instances; you can create agents using VMware, and so on.\n\nConclusion\n\nThousands of Jenkins instances are already using the various Android-related plugins, and Pipeline along with the Blue Ocean User Interface make using Jenkins simpler than it’s ever been.\n\nGive Jenkins a try for building your Android projects, check out the tutorials, and get in touch via the users' mailing list, or IRC.\n\nFinally, as with Jenkins itself, all plugins distributed are open-source, so feel free to contribute!","title":"Moving from buddybuild to Jenkins for Android Developers","tags":["android","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"https://chris.orr.me.uk/","github":"orrc","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Chris has been hanging around the Jenkins project since 2008, working on\nplugins, helping out folk on IRC, and speaking to people at conferences about\nJenkins.

Beyond saving time, the new\nplugin also assures adherence to proper coding standards and separates complex\nbusiness logic and standards declaration from execution flow.\n\nKey features:\n\nConvert single freestyle job to pipeline\n\nConvert chain of freestyle jobs to single pipeline\n\nWorks with both Jenkins and CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise\n\nPlugin can be customized to support any Freestyle plugin and an\norganization’s Pipeline Shared Library,\nor Groovy coding standards.\n\nWorks with CloudBees' Role-based Access Control to help the new Pipelines\ncomply with existing security policies.\n\nDirect migration of properties such as \"Build with Parameters\" to newly\ncreated Pipelines.\n\nDirect migration of Agent on which job is to be run with support for multiple agent labels across different downstream jobs\n\nEnvironment properties: JDK, NodeJS\n\nSupports Git SCM.\n\nBuild steps: Maven, Ant, Shell, Batch, and Ansible Playbook.\n\nPost build actions: artifact archiver, simple mailer, TestNG reports, JUnit reports, checkstyle publisher\n\nNow, let’s take a look at how to get started:\n\nClick on a link at Root level or Folder level or Job level.\n\nSelect the job from the drop-down list that is the beginning point of the\n\"chain\". If job level link is clicked, this drop-down list will not be visible.\n\nProvide the new pipeline job name. If this is not specified, the plugin will\nattempt to create a new pipeline job with the naming convention of\n\"oldname-pipeline\".\n\nCheck \"Recursively convert downstream jobs if any?\" if you wish to have all the\ndownstream jobs converted into this new pipeline. The plugin will write all the\nlogic of current and downstream jobs into a single pipeline.\n\nCheck \"Commit Jenkinsfile?\" if you would like the plugin to create a\nJenkinsfile and commit it back to the SCM. The plugin will commit the\nJenkinsfile at the root of the SCM repository it finds in the first job\n(selected in step 1 above). It will attempt to commit to this repo using the\ncredentials it finds in the first job.\n\nDo note that the plugin will checkout the repo in to a temporary workspace on\nthe controller (JENKINS_HOME/plugins/convert-to-    pipeline/ws). Once the\nconversion is complete and Jenkinsfile is committed back to the repo, the\nworkspace will be deleted.\n\nClick \"Convert\" to convert the Freestyle job configurations to a single\nscripted pipeline job. Once the conversion is complete and the new job is\ncreated, you will be redirected to the newly created pipeline job.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo learn more about plugin usage, customization and to see a demo\nclick here\nto watch the webinar replay on-demand.","title":"Auto-Convert Freestyle Jobs to Jenkins Pipeline","tags":["pipeline","freestyle"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Director of Labs &amp; Strategic Insights, Infostretch</p>\n</div>","id":"spillai","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sanil Pillai","slug":"/blog/authors/spillai","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":"46206425-c22d-532b-b23f-d107881ab35a","slug":"/blog/2017/12/14/security-update/","strippedHtml":"We just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.95 and 2.89.2, that fix two security vulnerabilities.\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\n\nWe usually announce core security updates well in advance on the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list, to give Jenkins administrators time to schedule a maintenance.\nAdditionally, we try to align security updates with the regular LTS schedule.\nWe have chosen not to do so in this case for two reasons:\n\nThe random failure to set up Jenkins is very noticeable, and given that we’ve seen automated exploits for unprotected Jenkins instances in the past we consider it important to fix that issue as soon as possible, so that users setting up new instances of Jenkins can be confident they won’t start up insecurely.\n\nThe CSRF issue appears to only affect instances for a very short (seconds at most, if at all) time period immediately after startup, so administrators could apply the fix during the next scheduled Jenkins downtime, rather than immediately.","title":"Security updates for Jenkins core","tags":["core","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and member of the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe was the inaugural Jenkins security officer from 2015 to 2021.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure in his spare time.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","id":"052134b8-bf47-5261-8b6e-17041407d5e3","slug":"/blog/2017/12/04/jenkins-user-conference-china-recap/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Forest Jing, who runs\nthe Shanghai Jenkins Area Meetup\n\nThe first Jenkins User Conference China was held on November 19, 2017 in\nShanghai, China. It was an amazing conference for Jenkins users in China. There were\nalmost 450 attendees to enjoy a lovely day with Jenkins creator, Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\n\nThere were 12 wonderful presentations, 1 workshop and 1 open space to set the stage for JUC China.\nThe day began with Kohsuke, welcomed to the stage by all the attendees here with their warm\napplauses. All of them are fans of Jenkins and Kohsuke.  Thanks to Kohsuke, he made a wonderful presentation to show the past, present and future of Jenkins for Chinese Jenkins users.\n\nThe co-founder of DevOps Times community, Le Zhang released a report of adoption of Deployment Pipeline in Chinese IT organization.\nThe report shows that Jenkins is the most popular tool for DevOps and CD in China.\n\nIt also has proven that “If it hurts, do it more often!” is right because the IT organization who deploy more frequently, deployment  failure would be less.\n\nThe Three Musketeers of DevOps in China (Le Zhang, Xuefeng Shi,Forest Jing) have demonstrated a DevOps pipeline based on Jenkins and many open-source software such as Kubernetes, Gitlab, etc.\n\nAfter the presentation, lots of fans waited in line to take pictures with Kohsuke.\n\nHere are some photos of the JUC China. We really enjoyed it.\n\nLastly, as an organizer for JUC China, I would like to thank Kohsuke Kawaguchi, Alyssa Tong, Sam Van Oort and so many friends from CloudBees and Jenkins community to have given us so many help to make the first JUC China an amazing and successful conference for Jenkins users in China. We look forward to organizing many more JUC China.","title":"Jenkins User Conference China Recap","tags":["event","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/8d248/alyssat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/c004c/alyssat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/9e67b/alyssat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/22924/alyssat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/89767/alyssat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/40d97/alyssat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/5028e/alyssat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":166}}},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"/blog/authors/alyssat","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":"fd21dbc6-9b4b-5092-b232-0feabaf928ce","slug":"/blog/2017/11/27/tutorials-in-the-jenkins-user-documentation/","strippedHtml":"Regular perusers of the Jenkins User Documentation may have noticed\nthe presence of the Tutorials part (between the Guided Tour and User\nHandbook) that appeared in the last couple of months and gradually began to get\npopulated with much of my recent work, writing Jenkins tutorials.\n\nMy name’s Giles and I’ve been a technical writer in the software development\nfield for several years now. I’ve always been passionate about technical writing\nand more recently, the technologies that go into developing written content and\nautomating its generation - like Jenkins! I was a former Atlassian and recently\njoined CloudBees as a Senior Technical Writer, working remotely from the \"Sydney\nOffice\", with my current focus on the Jenkins User Documentation.\n\nWhy tutorials?\n\nMy exposure to Jenkins and its usage over the years has been patchy at best.\nDuring this time, however, I’ve had some degree of experience as a user of\nvarious continuous delivery (CD) tools like Jenkins and am reasonably familiar\nwith the advantages these tools can offer software development teams.\n\nI’ve also found that while many software developers are familiar with the\nbroader concept of \"developer operations\" (or simply \"devops\"), fewer seem\nfamiliar with the concepts of CD and related tools to facilitate devops within\norganizations.\n\nThe CD process is based on the fundamental flow of building the application\ntesting it delivering it, where typically:\n\nThe building part involves compiling the application and/or ensuring all\nnecessary libraries and dependencies are in place for the application to run\nas intended.\n\nThe testing part involves testing the built application with automated tests\nto ensure that changes implemented by developers function as expected.\n\nThe delivering part involves packaging or presenting the application in a\nway that can be delivered to customers or other users for any kind of purpose.\n\nNow, as one of the major contributors to the Jenkins User Documentation (and\nfaced with a reasonably steep learning curve), it quickly became apparent about\nthe lack of accessible documentation to hand-hold people relatively new to\nJenkins through this CD process. I couldn’t find anything in the Jenkins User\nDocumentation to demonstrate how Jenkins implements this process on a simple\napp that delivers an end result.\n\nWith the guidance and assistance of helpful colleagues, I therefore decided to\nembark on creating a series of Jenkins tutorials to help fill these\ndocumentation and knowledge gaps. These tutorials are based on Daniele Procida’s\ndescription of how tutorials should be presented in his blog post\n\" What nobody tells you about\ndocumentation\").\n\nIntroductory tutorials\n\nThe first set of tutorials on the Tutorials overview page\ndemonstrate how to implement this fundamental CD process in Jenkins on a simple\napplication for a given technology stack.\n\nSo far, there’s one for\nJava with Maven and another\nfor Node.js and\nReact with npm. Another for Python will be added to this list in the near\nfuture.\n\nThese tutorials define your application’s entire CD process (i.e. your Pipeline)\nin a Jenkinsfile, whose Groovy-like Declarative Pipeline syntax is checked in\nto your Git source repository. Managing your Pipeline with your application’s\nsource code like this forms the fundamentals of \"Pipeline as code\".\n\nThe Introductory tutorials also cover how to use some powerful features of\nJenkins, like Blue Ocean,\nwhich makes it easy to connect to an existing cloud, web or locally hosted Git\nrepository and create your Pipeline with limited knowledge of Pipeline syntax.\n\nAdvanced tutorials\n\nAlso soon to be released will be the first Advanced tutorial on building\nmultibranch Pipelines in Jenkins. This tutorial takes the \"Pipeline as code\"\nconcept to a new level, where a single Jenkinsfile (defining the entire CD\nprocess across all branches of your application’s Git repository) consists of\nmultiple stages which are selectively executed based on the branch that Jenkins\nis building.\n\nAdditional tutorials that demonstrate more advanced features of Jenkins and how\nto manage your Pipelines with greater sophistication and flexibility will be\nadded to this section in future.\n\nSumming up\n\nYou can access all currently available tutorials from the\nTutorials overview page in the Jenkins User Documentation.\nIt’s worthwhile checking that page from time to time as it’ll be updated\nwhenever a new tutorial is published.\n\nAlso, if you have any suggestions for tutorials or other content you’d like to\nsee in the documentation, please post your suggestions in the\nJenkins\nDocumentation Google Group, which you can also post (and reply) to by emailing\njenkinsci-docs@googlegroups.com.\n\nThe Sydney Office team meeting at Carriageworks - from left to right, Giles\nGaskell, Nicholae Pascu, Michael Neale and James Dumay","title":"Introducing Tutorials in the Jenkins User Documentation","tags":["tutorial","blueocean","pipeline"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"gilesgas","html":"","id":"gilesgas","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Giles Gaskell","slug":"/blog/authors/gilesgas","twitter":"giles_gas"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":264,"numPages":101,"currentPage":34}},
