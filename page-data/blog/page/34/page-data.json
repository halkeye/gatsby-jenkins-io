It was an amazing conference for Jenkins users in China. There were\nalmost 450 attendees to enjoy a lovely day with Jenkins creator, Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\n\nThere were 12 wonderful presentations, 1 workshop and 1 open space to set the stage for JUC China.\nThe day began with Kohsuke, welcomed to the stage by all the attendees here with their warm\napplauses. All of them are fans of Jenkins and Kohsuke.  Thanks to Kohsuke, he made a wonderful presentation to show the past, present and future of Jenkins for Chinese Jenkins users.\n\nThe co-founder of DevOps Times community, Le Zhang released a report of adoption of Deployment Pipeline in Chinese IT organization.\nThe report shows that Jenkins is the most popular tool for DevOps and CD in China.\n\nIt also has proven that “If it hurts, do it more often!” is right because the IT organization who deploy more frequently, deployment  failure would be less.\n\nThe Three Musketeers of DevOps in China (Le Zhang, Xuefeng Shi,Forest Jing) have demonstrated a DevOps pipeline based on Jenkins and many open-source software such as Kubernetes, Gitlab, etc.\n\nAfter the presentation, lots of fans waited in line to take pictures with Kohsuke.\n\nHere are some photos of the JUC China. We really enjoyed it.\n\nLastly, as an organizer for JUC China, I would like to thank Kohsuke Kawaguchi, Alyssa Tong, Sam Van Oort and so many friends from CloudBees and Jenkins community to have given us so many help to make the first JUC China an amazing and successful conference for Jenkins users in China. We look forward to organizing many more JUC China.","title":"Jenkins User Conference China Recap","tags":["event","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/8d248/alyssat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/c004c/alyssat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/9e67b/alyssat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/22924/alyssat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/89767/alyssat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/40d97/alyssat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/5028e/alyssat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":166}}},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"/blog/authors/alyssat","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":"fd21dbc6-9b4b-5092-b232-0feabaf928ce","slug":"/blog/2017/11/27/tutorials-in-the-jenkins-user-documentation/","strippedHtml":"Regular perusers of the Jenkins User Documentation may have noticed\nthe presence of the Tutorials part (between the Guided Tour and User\nHandbook) that appeared in the last couple of months and gradually began to get\npopulated with much of my recent work, writing Jenkins tutorials.\n\nMy name’s Giles and I’ve been a technical writer in the software development\nfield for several years now. I’ve always been passionate about technical writing\nand more recently, the technologies that go into developing written content and\nautomating its generation - like Jenkins! I was a former Atlassian and recently\njoined CloudBees as a Senior Technical Writer, working remotely from the \"Sydney\nOffice\", with my current focus on the Jenkins User Documentation.\n\nWhy tutorials?\n\nMy exposure to Jenkins and its usage over the years has been patchy at best.\nDuring this time, however, I’ve had some degree of experience as a user of\nvarious continuous delivery (CD) tools like Jenkins and am reasonably familiar\nwith the advantages these tools can offer software development teams.\n\nI’ve also found that while many software developers are familiar with the\nbroader concept of \"developer operations\" (or simply \"devops\"), fewer seem\nfamiliar with the concepts of CD and related tools to facilitate devops within\norganizations.\n\nThe CD process is based on the fundamental flow of building the application\ntesting it delivering it, where typically:\n\nThe building part involves compiling the application and/or ensuring all\nnecessary libraries and dependencies are in place for the application to run\nas intended.\n\nThe testing part involves testing the built application with automated tests\nto ensure that changes implemented by developers function as expected.\n\nThe delivering part involves packaging or presenting the application in a\nway that can be delivered to customers or other users for any kind of purpose.\n\nNow, as one of the major contributors to the Jenkins User Documentation (and\nfaced with a reasonably steep learning curve), it quickly became apparent about\nthe lack of accessible documentation to hand-hold people relatively new to\nJenkins through this CD process. I couldn’t find anything in the Jenkins User\nDocumentation to demonstrate how Jenkins implements this process on a simple\napp that delivers an end result.\n\nWith the guidance and assistance of helpful colleagues, I therefore decided to\nembark on creating a series of Jenkins tutorials to help fill these\ndocumentation and knowledge gaps. These tutorials are based on Daniele Procida’s\ndescription of how tutorials should be presented in his blog post\n\" What nobody tells you about\ndocumentation\").\n\nIntroductory tutorials\n\nThe first set of tutorials on the Tutorials overview page\ndemonstrate how to implement this fundamental CD process in Jenkins on a simple\napplication for a given technology stack.\n\nSo far, there’s one for\nJava with Maven and another\nfor Node.js and\nReact with npm. Another for Python will be added to this list in the near\nfuture.\n\nThese tutorials define your application’s entire CD process (i.e. your Pipeline)\nin a Jenkinsfile, whose Groovy-like Declarative Pipeline syntax is checked in\nto your Git source repository. Managing your Pipeline with your application’s\nsource code like this forms the fundamentals of \"Pipeline as code\".\n\nThe Introductory tutorials also cover how to use some powerful features of\nJenkins, like Blue Ocean,\nwhich makes it easy to connect to an existing cloud, web or locally hosted Git\nrepository and create your Pipeline with limited knowledge of Pipeline syntax.\n\nAdvanced tutorials\n\nAlso soon to be released will be the first Advanced tutorial on building\nmultibranch Pipelines in Jenkins. This tutorial takes the \"Pipeline as code\"\nconcept to a new level, where a single Jenkinsfile (defining the entire CD\nprocess across all branches of your application’s Git repository) consists of\nmultiple stages which are selectively executed based on the branch that Jenkins\nis building.\n\nAdditional tutorials that demonstrate more advanced features of Jenkins and how\nto manage your Pipelines with greater sophistication and flexibility will be\nadded to this section in future.\n\nSumming up\n\nYou can access all currently available tutorials from the\nTutorials overview page in the Jenkins User Documentation.\nIt’s worthwhile checking that page from time to time as it’ll be updated\nwhenever a new tutorial is published.\n\nAlso, if you have any suggestions for tutorials or other content you’d like to\nsee in the documentation, please post your suggestions in the\nJenkins\nDocumentation Google Group, which you can also post (and reply) to by emailing\njenkinsci-docs@googlegroups.com.\n\nThe Sydney Office team meeting at Carriageworks -
