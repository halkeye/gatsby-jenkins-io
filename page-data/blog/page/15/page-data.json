You learn that this involves helping the game studio iterate their work\nagainst eight different target platforms, each with their SDK, on four different main pipelines,\nplus a lot of extra auxiliary jobs. And, of course, the studio wants all of this to go smoothly, in\norder to maintain a good pace of features and bugfixes for every release - a release happening\nevery two weeks. Hitting hundreds of millions of players worldwide.\n\nHow are you going to make sure that the environment stays correctly configured, with the\nright versions of the required software; helping the studio maintain stability and scalability of\ntheir pipelines; ensuring operability of the Jenkins instance; improving the speed of the builds\nmonth after month?\n\nIt’s OK to sweat. You are going to need some help!\n\nThis is just a regular day in the office for a build engineer working at King. Facing a very\nbroad problem, with high quality standards and even higher stakes. Thankfully, we are not\nalone. We have access to a lot of tools - either open source tools, tools developed by the\nstudios or tools developed by our stellar build infrastructure team in Barcelona - to help carry\nus all the way to the publish line. We put all of these tools together, and by their powers\ncombined, we provide fast, easily operable workflows for the studios, cutting minutes here\nand there, ensuring the features a smooth sail from dev, to master, to release.\n\nI will explain all of the tricks we use at King to speed builds up, and to make Jenkins operation\neasier for our studios on December 4, 2019, at DevOps World | Jenkins\nWorld Lisbon.\nUse JWFOSS for 30% discount on registration!\nFor now, let’s take a look at some of them.\n\nWhere do we start?\n\nWe use on-premises elastic infrastructure, spawning machines from certain templates\nwhenever they are needed. This means that for every build, we are getting a fresh\nenvironment - no intermediate artifacts leftover or anything of the sort, which is good. That\nalso means that we need to clone our repositories and compile everything every time, which is\nbad. However, we have solutions for these two problems.\n\nWe make full use of linkclones/snapshots when spawning a VM. Every night we run a\nbootstrapper that will power on the base image and perform whatever operations we decide on\nit, before turning it back into a template and re-creating the snapshot. In the case of Candy\nCrush, we update our caches, and this helps us cut some time off of git clone and compilation.\nWe call this bootstrapper “cacheo”. It looks more or less like this:\n\nCacheo\n\n1. Start elastic agent template image\n2. Connect it to Jenkins\n3. Perform cleanup\n4. Trigger git reference cache jobs\n5. Trigger all the builds you want cached\n6. Turn off template image, delete the agent and recreate the linked clone snapshot\n\nEvery studio can specify on which templates will cacheo run, and what will it do in each of them.\nMaybe you want to make sure your Android license is on point. Or download some\npackages from artifactory. Perhaps pre-load your gradle dependencies. Whatever it is, cacheo\ndoes it for you and updates your base images every night.\n\nOne of the most common uses is to pre-fill a local git cache, and when doing so, the\nimprovement is very visible, especially on Windows:\n\nLinux\nMacOS\nWindows\n\nNFS\n2 min 11s\n2min 34s\n8min 32s\n\nLocal\n1 min 20s\n1min 35s\n3min 49s\n\nDifference\n39% faster\n39% faster\n55% faster\n\nThis means, speeding up source code fetching by 55% on Windows, on average. That is a LOT!!\n\nBut what about actual compilation?\n\nAll of our major games use the same engine; we bring this code in by means of submodules. This means\nthere is a big bunch of shared code that needs to be compiled and linked whenever we build the game.\nAnd it’s not rare that this shared code is bigger than the actual game code!\nThankfully, the engine team lent us a hand, and they developed a way to package the compiled shared code.\nNormally, the game code lives alongside a specific version of the shared code, which doesn’t get updated too frequently.\nSometimes once a month, sometimes to grab a hotfix. This translates to us potentially compiling the\nexact same shared code for quite some time, every time we build the game. Thanks to these\nprebuilt artifacts, we are able to skip a huge part of the compilation, at the cost of a simple artifactory download.\n\nCacheo\n\nif generate_prebuilt_libs:\n    compile_project()\n\n    generate_empty_cmakelists()\n\n    for dependency in dependencies:\n        merge_compiled_dependency_into_metalib(dependency)\n        write_dependency_to_generated_cmakelists_as_alias_for_metalib(dependency)\n\nelif use_prebuilt_libs:\n    add_generated_cmakelists_with_metalib_as_dependency()\n\n    compile_project()\n\nThanks to these prebuilt libraries, we are able to skip a big chunk of the compilation,\nand it builds up really quickly! Iterative work on several branches, as long as they have\nthe same engine version, gets sped up in noticeable ways.\nThere are, however, specific cases when we do choose to build the shared code regardless, such as\nwhen we build release candidates for instance.\n\nJust so you get an idea, times on this table are on average:\n\niOS\nWindows\n\nNo prebuilts\n20min 17s\n40min 30s\n\nPrebuilts\n10min 2s\n23min 20s\n\nDifference\n51% faster\n43% faster\n\nI just don’t want to have to deal with bureaucracy\n\nOperating Jenkins can be quite complicated. Talk about “Tell me\nsomething I don’t know”, right? And with so many moving pieces (elastic\ninfrastructure, plugins, dirty workspaces), it might not be easy for\neveryone to run specific maintenance tasks. We have a lot of small\npipelines, created by the build infrastructure group, that we can use to\ndiagnose and work around certain errors, as well as gather useful\ninformation that might be otherwise difficult to find. These pipelines\ndo things like printing all the installed plugins, deleting offline\non-demand agents, cleaning disconnected VMs from vSphere, or re-run\npuppet in a specific Jenkins instance. And any user can run these jobs,\nthere is no need to be an admin. This allows the team to unblock\nthemselves if they need to by using these jobs. Here’s one that I\nparticularly like. How many times have you modified a pipeline and, when\ntrying to run it, the first thing that happens is that Jenkins says that\nit needs approval?\n\nScript Approval\n\nimport org.jenkinsci.plugins.scriptsecurity.scripts.*\n\n@NonCPS\n\n// Disclaimer - this can have serious security consequences\n// Be mindful when you run this!\n\ndef call() {\n    sa = ScriptApproval.get()\n    toApproveScripts = sa.getPendingScripts().collect()\n    println (\"toApproveScripts: \" + toApproveScripts)\n    toApproveScripts.each {pending ->\n        sa.get().approveScript(pending.getHash())\n\tprintln (\"approvedScripts: \" + pending.getHash())\n\t}\n    sa.save()\n}\n\nThe best part? All our Jenkins instances include these jobs, by default, so\nno one misses out on the fun.","title":"How to build the top mobile game for every platform imaginable","tags":["jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2019","mobile-game"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#483838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/19e71/ignacio_fernandez.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/77b35/ignacio_fernandez.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/d4a57/ignacio_fernandez.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/19e71/ignacio_fernandez.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/68974/ignacio_fernandez.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/ef6ff/ignacio_fernandez.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/8257c/ignacio_fernandez.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/6766a/ignacio_fernandez.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/22bfc/ignacio_fernandez.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"Napo2k","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Nacho is a Build Engineer with several years of experience in the videogame industry, and has worked in both AAA projects as well as free-to-play and mobile.\nCurrently, Nacho works at King Stockholm, taking care of Jenkins operations for Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga.</p>\n</div>","id":"ignacio_fernandez","irc":null,"linkedin":"ignaciofernandezpuerta","name":"Ignacio 'Nacho' Fernández","slug":"/blog/authors/ignacio_fernandez","twitter":"@napo2k"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"09c19419-deb1-5016-ab06-4383186a37e4","slug":"/blog/2019/11/01/devops-world-jenkins-world-san-francisco-in-living-colors/","strippedHtml":"DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco was August 12 -

Tyler Croy about Jenkins Wiki stability issues\nand making it read-only as a temporary measure to stabilize the instance\n( mailing list thread).\nAlthough the functionality has been partially restored afterwards,\nthere is a consensus in the Infrastructure team that we should gradually move to alternate solutions.\n\nExamples\n\nSince the announcement in September, more than 50 plugins were moved from Wiki to GitHub.\nFew examples:\n\nConfiguration as Code Plugin\n\nMailer Plugin\n\nGradle Plugin\n\nRole Strategy Plugin\n\nHow to enable GitHub documentation for your plugin?\n\nConvert documentation from Wiki to GitHub Asciidoc or Markdown format if you have not done it yet.\n\nIt can be easily done in a semi-automatic way using Jenkins Wiki Exporter\n\nSee the guidelines\nhere.\n\nChange the field in pom.xml so that it points to GitHub\n( guide).\n Examples of valid links:\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/mailer-plugin - plugin site will use GitHub REST API to extract README\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ssh-credentials-plugin/blob/master/doc/README.md - extraction of a plugin page from a custom location\n\nOptional: Add badges to the page to improve look&feel and to provide quick links for users.\nThere are standard badges for changelogs, chats, plugin site, and installation numbers.\n\nExample for Markdown\n\nExample for Asciidoc\n\nRelease the new plugin version\n\nWait a few hours till the change propagates.\nAfter that, the Jenkins Plugin Site will show the new documentation from GitHub.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe story is tracked as jira:WEBSITE-406[] which is a part of the wider subproject for using GitHub as a source of data for the Jenkins plugin site and update managers (jira:WEBSITE-637[]).\nLater steps include support showing changelogs from GitHub releases, pulling plugin tags from GitHub, showing plugin logos, and using Repository Permission Updater as a source of the maintainer information.\n\nHow to contribute?\n\nOctober is a great time to contribute!\nPlugin documentation is one of the featured projects for Hacktoberfest,\nand we will welcome all contributions to the documentation and to the codebase.\n\nContributing to Documentation\n\nWe are looking for contributors who are interested to improve plugin documentation and to help us with migration from Wiki to GitHub.\nFor dozens of plugins the documentation is already in GitHub,\nand you are welcome to submit pull requests against any repository.\n\nMigrating documentation:\n\nMigrating plugin documentation from Wiki to GitHub\n\nMoving documentation from Jenkins Wiki to jenkins.io\n\njira:JENKINS-59467[Template issue for plugin docs migration]\n\nNewbie-friendly documentation tasks\n\nIf you have any questions about contributing to the documentation,\nplease see this page or reach out to us in the Docs SIG Gitter chat.\n\nCode contributions\n\nWould you like to write some code in Java or JavaScript?\nOr would you like to work on CSS styles and improve Jenkins design?\nIn such case you are welcome to contribute to the Jenkins Plugin Site.\nIt is our own plugin marketplace implementation, and we invite contributions to this area.\nThe plugin site is really easy to develop.\n\njira:WEBSITE-637[] -

This was great\nand I wanted to share in hopes of encouraging more people to join.\nYou can learn more about the Google Summer of Code here: https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/\n\nCommunity Bonding\n\nThe first phase of the project is the community bonding phase. This is where the student and other mentors come together\nto lay out the plan for the project. It is important to set expectations and ensure that the student is well aware of\nwhat will take place and also made to feel welcome.\n\nParichay Barpanda was the student and he was super awesome from the get go. The project he was working on was the Gitlab\nBranch Source Plugin. More can be found here: jenkinsci/gitlab-branch-source-plugin\n\nFrom the mentor side it was myself and Justin Harringa. Justin was just amazing throughout this project and I seriously\ncould not have done this without him. He was encouraging, empathetic and just all around great. I would gladly serve\nwith him again.\n\nWe laid out our plan and guidance and got to work.\n\nFirst Evaluations\n\nThe first evaluation was quickly upon us and Parichay was ready!\nThe work he put in was nothing shy of amazing. We did our 1st demo and he really rocked it. A video of that demo can be\nfound on : Youtube\n\nSecond Evaluations\n\nThere was not much time to rest before we realized that phase II end was upon us but Parichay was ready. Again, he\nnailed it.\n\nThat demo can be found here\n\nMentors Submit Final Evaluations\n\nWe had our final evaluation and at this point Parichay was seasoned. He was getting issues assigned to him, working on\nlittle bug fixes and setting his roadmap for features. He absolutely blew Justin and I away.\n\nParichay’s final evaluation demo can be seen here\n\nAt the conclusion of the final demo’s, Justin and I met and went over Parichay’s final evaluation. At this point we had\nmet twice a week for several months, we have reviewed code daily, we had community involvement and most of all we had\nseen Parichay grow into a seasoned software developer.\n\nJustin and I were without a doubt passing Parichay on his entire body of work. I am actually tearing up typing this\nbecause I am so proud of Parichay.\n\nOrg Admin\n\nBeing an org admin for the 2019 Google Summer of Code project for the Jenkins organization was truly rewarding and couldn’t\nhave been accomplished without the help from Oleg Nenashev, Martin d’Anjou, Jeff Pearce and Lloyd Chang.\n\nAs an org admin we handled issues with mentors, community members and disagreements involving work. These items were only\na few and as a team we handled them accordingly.\n\nWe regularly met to discuss and plan. Coordinating and dealing with a project like Google Summer of Code is no small feat\nbut this team made it super easy and I am so thankful for them and all that I learned.\n\nClosing\n\nIn looking back at this experience I am so grateful for the opportunity I was given. This was such a rewarding experience\nto not only be able to mentor but also be an org admin. Not only will I be back next year (we are already in the\nplanning stages) but I highly encourage people reading this to consider joining. You will not be disappointed.\n\nI am so thankful for all the students, mentors and fellow org admins. Your dedication to open source is so valued. You\nshowed and continue to show what this project is all about, and that is being welcoming, open and transparent. Helping\npeople grow as individuals while learning skills is what I love about this community.\n\nThank you to everyone and I hope your futures are bright!","title":"Google Summer of Code Mentor and Org Admin Perspective","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2019","jenkins","community","events","mentor"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

I came across this initiative in a blog post. I had been contributing to Jenkins at the time and decided to have a chat with Oleg Nenashev and Tracy Miranda regarding the possibility of a project under the Community Bridge initiative. Fortunately for me JCasC ( Jenkins Configuration as Code) had the mentors as well as the project idea in place to start a project. After a few regular meetings we ironed out the details of the programme and on August 7th I began with my journey!\n\nJCasC Developer Tools — JSON Schema\n\nJSON files when submitted to a server undergo a validation to determine whether the values and the format are correct and that they conform to a well defined schema, this schema is known as a JSON Schema. A YAML file can also be validated using a JSON Schema.\nThe main premise of JCasC is to load YAML files written by developers into the Jenkins instance. An example of a JCasC YAML file is:\n\n---\njenkins:\n systemMessage: “Hello World”\n numExecutors:2\n ---\n\nThe above YAML configuration will configure Jenkins to display a message Hello world with the number of executors set to two. In order to validate the YAML we have a schema. This schema is written using jelly files (Executable XML files) and currently it is not a valid schema. The first phase of the project is based around rewriting the schema generation to java and developing a better test framework for it, because currently the schema is not testable.\n\nPhase 1 — JCasC Dev Tools\n\nThe first week I got into studying how the schema was generated.With the support of two of my awesome mentors Tim Jacomb and Joseph Peterson\nI finally got an understanding of the current schema.\nSo JCasC has a set of configurators for describing a YAML file.\nThey are:\na) Base Configurators\nb) Hetero Describable Configurators\nc) Data Bound Configurators\nThese configurators together successfully describe a YAML file.\nWe proceeded to generate the schema with the help of individual description of each of these configurators.\nThe JSON Schema has a set of components, consider the above yaml file as an example:\n\n---\n{\n  \"jenkins\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"systemMessage\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"numExecutors\": {\n        \"type\": \"integer\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n---\n\nSo here Jenkins is the base configurator and it has a set of attributes viz systemMessage and numExecutors, so our schema needs to be able to describe a set of attributes for every field in the schema. Some of the fields that our JSON Schema uses to describe the YAML are:\n\n1) type : String, int, Boolean etc.\n\n2) properties : A set of fields describing the part field.\n\n3) id: Unique Identifier for the field\nThus the above schema successfully verifies the YAML configuration.\n\nJAVA Rewrite\n\nWe used JSON Objects to build components of the schema.The basic flow that is followed to generate the schema is as follows:\n\na) Iterate through the Base Configurators.\n\nb) Iterate over the list of Base Configurator.Attributes and add each attribute to the schema.\n\nc) Iterate over the HeteroDescribable Configurators and add each configurator to the schema along with its required properties.\n\nThe set of PR’s Resolved during Phase 1 are as follows:\n\na) Basic Schema\n\nb) Schema Doc Page\n\nc) Test Framework\n\nd) Nested Schema\n\nThat is all from me guys, I am currently preparing for phase 2 and working towards fixing any pending issues of Phase 1. Thanks for reading.\n\nPhase 2 Goals:\n\nWe would primarily target VSCode integration in phase 2 with the aim of:\n\na)Validation of JCasC YAML files with the schema\n\nb)Autocompletion\n\nc)Integration with a live Jenkins instance.\n\nContributions\n\nWe would love to get feedback from you on the stuff we are working on. Contributions to the project would be highly appreciated.\n\na) Gitter Chat\n\nb) Github Repository\n\nc) Project Introduction","title":"JCasC Community Bridge Dev Tools - Phase 1","tags":["community-bridge","JCasC","VSCode","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"sladyn98","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sladyn is a Computer Science student at Mumbai University, India.\nHe is participating in Community Bridge 2019 to provide development tools to JCasC plugin in the form of IDE integrations, schema architecture improvements and configuration extension points <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin\">Configuration as Code Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"sladyn98","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sladyn Nunes","slug":"/blog/authors/sladyn98","twitter":"SladynN"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":112,"numPages":100,"currentPage":15}},
