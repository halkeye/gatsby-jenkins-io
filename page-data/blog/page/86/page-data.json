But this is not true. +\n +\n\n+\nAs Jenkins gains traction among .NET developers, it's becoming increasingly clear that Java is very alien to them. They naturally have no idea of what a war file means, and often don't even have Java installed, and so it was _just not easy enough_ for them to start using Jenkins. +\n +\n\n+\nI'm happy to report that I've finally fixed this problem with the new Windows installer. It is primarily packaged as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer[an MSI file] — a common format that seasoned Windows devs/admins are familiar with. It can, for example, be deployed remotely on a large number of servers via Active Directory remotely. Or you can just double-click it to install it interactively. It bundles JRE, so no separate Java installation is needed. +\n +\n\n+\nThe package also contains the bootstrap `+setup.exe+`, to install .NET 2.0 runtime if it's not installed yet. Between that and JRE, it got all the dependencies covered. I tested that by installing it on a fresh Windows XP install. +\n +\n\n+\nSo I hope this makes Jenkins more attractive to .NET and other developers who live and die by Windows.","title":"Windows installers are now available","tags":["general","releases","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"598cdaff-a8e7-5d08-a3d6-2a93f385d234","slug":"/blog/2011/03/21/the-polls-are-open-for-the-jenkins-logo-contest/","strippedHtml":"After a number of absolutely fantastic logo submissions from a number of designers, I’m extremely pleased to open the polls on the vote for the brand new Jenkins logo!\n\nThe thumbnails do not do any of these logos justice in my opinion, so I recommend opening each logo up in its own tab to get the full effect :)\n\nI plan to end voting March 28th at 12:01 UTC.\n\nThe Logos\n\nLogo #1\nLogo #2\nLogo #3\n\nLogo #4\nLogo #5\nLogo #6\n\nLogo #7\nLogo #8\nLogo #9\n\nLogo #10\nLogo #11\n\nThe Vote\n\nIf the iframe doesn’t properly load for you, you can open Loading...\" class=\"bare\">https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dE9GNlpNbVEwa0VPZHl1TkJCaUI1Z2c6MQ Loading...","title":"The polls are open for the Jenkins Logo Contest!","tags":["general","feedback","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

But better late than never...). As with https://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/04/22/hudson-hits-1300?force=752[1.300] and https://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2008/03/hudson_hits_120.html?force=824[1.200], this release doesn't particularly signify any substantial major release, but nonetheless it is a milestone for those of us who are involved in the project — I think repeating something 400 times is something one can be proud of. It's a bit like climbing a mountain. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, ... and when you look up, voila! +\n +\n\n+\nIn 2 years since 1.300, which was April 2009, we've added a lot of features. We now have a CLI to manipulate the server, auto-installation of JDK/Ant/Maven to simplify cluster management, concurrent builds of the same job, community-contributed localizations to 20+ languages, boolean expression over the job/label assignment control, parallel initialization based on a dynamically built acyclic directed graph, console annotations to enrich the build output, far more extensible queue (that enabled a lot of plugins), Windows 7 / Vista support, improved controller/agent communication stability, Maven 3 support, and then all around performance improvements, in memory footprint, in startup time, and in page rendering speed. +\n +\n\n+\nAnd of course, we had to change the name of the project. That was a real distraction, but now that the divorce is over, things have been https://bobbickel.blogspot.com/2011/03/jenkins-vs-hudson-time-to-upgrade.html[moving well] for Jenkins. I guess any organization (including any sizable OSS project) is really more than sum of all individuals. If you take a store of Target and replace all its workers by those of nearby Staples, it'll probably not work out well. I think https://jenkins-ci.org/why[people understand that]. +\n +\n\n+\nAnd on the positive side, I do think we came out stronger. We are now running https://jenkins-ci.org/node/280[governance meetings on IRC], we now have https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins[somewhat more formal governance structure]. The core development is actually accelarating with the help of https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/graphs/impact[many new developers], such as Olivier Lamy, (scroll to the right), and https://twitter.com/#!/jenkins_release[plugin releases kept coming at amazing rate] — we are now at 350+ plugins, more than doubled since 1.300. +\n +\n\n+\nLooking at future, we are working on a number of new initiatives in the community, too. For example, Arnaud Héritier is working on revisiting https://issues.jenkins.io/[our JIRA project structure], Andrew Bayer is running a contest for new logo, Tyler is in process of getting additional hardwares at OSUOSL for the project. I'm also doing a lot of things, but for example, I'm going to write a proposal to start a stable patch releases of Jenkins that only consists of backported important bug fixes, in addition to the current weekly release model. Several large users maintain private branches of Jenkins, and so I think it makes a lot of sense for those folks to align their efforts around this release line. I'm also thinking that we could launch a community acceptance testing (CAT) effort around this, much like https://qa.netbeans.org/processes/cat/67/faqs.html[NetBeans] and https://glassfish.java.net/quality/portal/[GlassFish] have done it. I think the first stable release line would branch off from 1.400, so if anything that's another reason you should upgrade to 1.400. +\n +\n\n+\nWhen I reflect on the project, I'm surprised at just how much work there is to be done, after so much that has been achived. But I'm still excited at what we can do with this platform. I thank everyone for their continued patoronage of Jenkins, and I hope to see more of you in the mailing lists, in the chat rooms, and in the meet-up events.
