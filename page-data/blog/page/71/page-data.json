Like the East Coast conference, the Berlin one is almost full, so sign up while you can.\n\nOur venue in Berlin is KOSMOS, a building with a fascinating history. The building was inaugurated as a cinema in 1961. With 1001 seats, it was the largest, most modern and most popular film theatre in the former GDR and has since been extensively modernized in line with the requirements of historically listed buildings.\n\nWe have an excellent line-up of speakers filling up two conference tracks.\n\nOnce again, we have some fabulous sponsors to thank. Without them, there would be no JUC.\n\nThis year we’ve introduced a new Community sponsorship level, which allows non-corporate groups like JUGSs to help support the conference as well. (Drop a note to juc-oc-ext AT cloudbees DOT com if your group is interested).\n\nWe are very grateful to all of our sponsors – thank you! Hopefully see everyone at JUC.\n\nPS – if you are coming to Berlin for JUC, check out the CD Summit on June 24 at the same venue. There’s also one on June 19 in NYC. The summit will focus on how continuous integration with Jenkins streamlines processes and automates testing and deployment, providing the foundation you need for continuous delivery.","title":"Two Weeks Till Jenkins User Conference Berlin","tags":["general","meetup","news","jenkinsci","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"lisawells","html":"","id":"lisawells","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Lisa Wells","slug":"/blog/authors/lisawells","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"f1f036eb-db08-5222-9222-c3a1f80d792e","slug":"/blog/2014/06/09/thinking-about-moving-on-to-servlet-3-0/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Legacy[ +\nimage:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Subaru_Legacy_V_Kombi_rear_20100402.jpg/320px-Subaru_Legacy_V_Kombi_rear_20100402.jpg[image,width=240,height=156] +\n] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nOne of the current efforts under way in the dev list is driven by https://github.com/tfennelly[Tom Fennelly] et al, who is working on introducing a series of small ball improvements to the user interface in Jenkins. If this is something you are interested in (and who aren't?), you should see https://gist.github.com/kevinburke/9d4f127a7005eaa9d970[Kevin Burke's manifest] that sets out the plan of attack, and https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/zDaX4yiWLLw[This mega thread on the dev list] for the discussion. +\n +\n\n+\nThere are numerous sub-conversations born out of this, and one of them is the minimum required servlet spec version for Jenkins. +\n +\n\n+\nJenkins devs are thinking about ways to update page contents post load, for example so that the list view will keep updating as stuff happens. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websocket[WebSocket] was discussed as an option, and then https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events[server-side events], which seems to be the current favorite. +\n +\n\n+\nTo use any of those async HTTP features, we need servlet 3.0. Unfortunately, if we are to do it, Jenkins will not run on earlier versions of the container. There's no graceful fallback that works with servlet 2.5 containers due to the way servlet 3.0 is written. +\n +\n\n+\nSo I looked into https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14YzFgKBB6BvbRU_1OjChC3efECWPs77TEGTU09t3KGw/edit#gid=873989456[the impact of this change to the users]. +\n +\nIt turns out that the most users run Jenkins through `+java -jar jenkins.war+`, which are already running servlet 3.0 compatible Winstone 2.x (based on Jetty 8.) And people running newer version of Jenkins tends to run newer version of containers. When I look at people who are running >=1.509 and later, 70% of them run on servlet 3 compatible container. The number for >=1.532 is 84%, then for >=1.554 it's 94%. +\n +\n\n+\nWhen I look at which container is dragging us down as of >= 1.554, you see that there's a sizable Tomcat6 deployments (2.5%). If we start requiring Servlet 3.0 these people will be in a nasty surprise. Then there's about 1.8% who claims to be running on Winstone 0.9.10, which is really puzzling, but I'm assuming these people are getting OEM-ed Jenkins of a sort (multiple large companies are known to do this), so these people will likely be able to update to Winstone 2.x automatically by virtue of getting a new jenkins.war from their upstream. So all in all I'd say if we start requiring servlet 3.0 today, there'll be about 3% user base who will be impacted. +\n +\n\n+\nThis post is a trial balloon to see the community reaction to this idea. If you have reasons to argue against us moving to servlet 3.0, we'd like to hear from you — https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-23378[please share your thoughts on our issue tracker]! +","title":"Thinking about moving on to Servlet 3.0","tags":["development","core","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b66f126d-826e-5d04-b55d-285c4d0f9e47","slug":"/blog/2014/06/06/other-events-for-juc-visitors-cd-seminar/","strippedHtml":"+ +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIf you will be on the US East Coast or in Berlin for JUC, some of the JUC sponsors are organizing separate events called https://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit[Continuous Delivery Seminar], which might be of interest to you.

That person shares the plugin with the community, and since it does everything he needs, he moves on to work on something else. Then another person starts using that plugin, comes up with an idea for improvement, implements that, and then moves on. Given that we have more than 900 plugins today, there are a plenty of plugins that are currently co-maintained by the community, which could really use a focused loving caregiver. +\n +\n\n+\nSo why don't you adopt a plugin? You can pick up one of those plugins and act as a maintainer. You'll hear appreciation from people who are using that plugin, and most plugins are small and simple enough even for people new to Jenkins. Above all, working on plugins don't require much communication with existing developers and implicit processes, which is often difficult for new people to find out. +\n +\n\n+\nHere's how you can find a plugin to adopt. You can look at https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pending+Pull+Requests[repositories that have most pending pull requests]. Plugins with lots of pull requests likely could use some help, so check if anyone is actively working on it and talk to him, or if you don't see much activities from a single person, just go ahead and adopt the plugin. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html[Usage statistics] has `+top-plugins500.svg+` (this is for https://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/201404-top-plugins500.svg[the last month]). Open that in Firefox, which lets you zoom in. Scroll all the way to the right, and you see popular plugins. Compare that with https://github.com/jenkinsci/[our GitHub repositories], and you can find popular plugins that aren't getting enough love. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel[Issue tracker] is also a good place to look for a plugin in need of help. Every plugin has a separate component, so look at bugs and RFEs filed against those, especially with lots of votes. Fix a bug is great, but even just helping with the triage process would be highly appreciated. +\n +\n\n+\nTry adopting a plugin for a while, and when you get the hang of it, let https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev[the dev list know]. Update `+pom.xml+` to have your name listed as a maintainer. Come https://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat[join IRC]. That way, we know who you are and how to reach you. +\n +\n\n+\nSee, it's really not that hard. And there's something really satisfying in making things a little better and seeing happy users.
