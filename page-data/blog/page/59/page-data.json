This requires large amounts of effort to create and manage jobs to test and build multiple projects and keeps the actual configuration of a job to build/test/deploy a project separate from the actual code being built/tested/deployed. This prevents users from applying their existing CI/CD best practices to the job configurations themselves.\n\nTo address this, Kohsuke is proposing that we :\n\nIntroduce a new subsystem in Jenkins that:\n\nlets you design a whole pipeline, not just a single linear set of tasks\n\nstores the said pipeline configuration as human-editable Jenkinsfile in your SCM\n\nmakes it automatic to set up new pipelines when Jenkinsfile is added\n\ndifferentiates multiple branches in the same repository\n\nThis is the key new feature that positions Jenkins for continuous delivery use cases and other more complex automations of today.\n\nKohsuke’s proposal is largely about bringing together a lot of already existing pieces together to provide a very compelling experience for new and existing users alike. I hope it is clear now why this proposal is so exciting to me.\n\nProviding Feedback\n\nWe’re asking you to read the proposal in\nJENKINS-31152, which itself have some additional tickets linked under it, and provide\nfeedback if you have it.\n\nIf you have ever logged in to the issue\ntracker or the\nwiki, you have a \"Jenkins user account\" which\nmeans you’ll be able to log into the issue tracker and vote for, or comment on\nthe issue linked above.\n\n( note : if you have forgotten your password, use the account\napp to reset it.)\n\nWe’re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either\napprove or reject the proposal two weeks from today.\n\nStay tuned for a couple more posts covering proposals to improve the Jenkins interface and user experience!","title":"Jenkins 2.0 Proposal: Pipeline as Code front and center","tags":["general","core","pipeline","workflow","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

The linked issue expands on what the problem is here:\n\nCurrently Jenkins embeds a distribution of Groovy into \"core\" for a variety of scripting and management tasks. This version of Groovy is locked into core in such a way that users cannot upgrade Groovy independently from Jenkins itself. If the Jenkins-bundled version were upgraded to a different major version, it may break users' custom scripts as well as plugins that use Groovy due to API changes.\n\nThe proposal is relatively straight-forward and affects the many different users and use-cases for the embedded Groovy scripting support in Jenkins:\n\nFor ease of maintenance and modularity it would be useful to split Jenkins' use of Groovy into a library plugin; different clients could request 1.x and 2.x simultaneously by using different versions of the library, etc.\n\nStuff in core using Groovy that would need to either be put in this library (if infrastructure for other features) or put in another plugin depending on it (if first-class features themselves):\n\nI selected this proposal to feature on this blog, despite its rather technical underpinnings, it will affect core developers, plugin developers, power and casual users alike.
