Instead, what it does mean, is that the Jenkins mainline is much more friendly to runtime analysis of classes with which it is not familiar.\n\nThe problem\n\nWhen analyzing plugin classes, Jenkins uses just about every kind of metadata you can think of to get information about them: Class name, Field names, method names, member modifiers, annotations, you name it. It even uses the containing class relationship for inner classes to match Descriptors with what they describe.\n\nIt’s all a great example of convention over configuration (CoC). In fact, I’ve never really seen CoC implemented in a Java project before as successfully as it has been in Jenkins. Plugin authors don’t have to duplicate any metadata that Jenkins can figure out for you — and it’s alot! The drawback though, is that extensions depend very heavily on conforming to the structure of a conventional Java class.\n\nThe changes in this merge, and in several of the modules on which Jenkins depends, allow more than ever to get this information by asking an object directly rather than querying its private class structure.\n\nThe Kicker\n\nMany of theses changes aren’t even JRuby specific! While they do enable JRuby integration, They’re really just making things more friendly for dynamic languages in general. So, in theory, it should pave the way for others like JavaScript and Python.\n\nWhere now?\n\nWe’re still working on the ruby runtime and tools which will provide as crisp a Ruby development experience as we can. I don’t want to proffer an estimate of when those will begin to be useable, but it is important to mark this very important milestone and explain what it does and does not mean.\n\nWe need you!\n\nThere is still much work to be done to enable a writing Jenkins plugins in Ruby, we are looking for people who know Ruby and feel like pitching in: writing Rake tasks, improving the glue layer, documentation, etc.\n\nIf you’re interested, most of the action is happening on the jenkinsrb@googlegroups.com mailing list, so join us!","title":"JRuby Branch merged!","tags":["development","core","jenkinsci","ruby","jruby"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"cowboyd","html":"","id":"cowboyd","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Charles Lowell","slug":"/blog/authors/cowboyd","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","id":"68b30e7a-bc62-5d0d-b11b-63127be962fc","slug":"/blog/2011/07/18/mirror-mirror-on-the-wall/","strippedHtml":"Let me preface this entire post with this: I love\nContegix .\n\nWhile working on some infrastructure tasks I had long-since put-off for the\nJenkins project, I noticed something this weekend that scared the hell out of\nme.\n\nAt some undetermined time, our MirrorBrain\ninstallation stopped redirecting to our mirror network.

This release line branches off from a bit old Jenkins release (in this case 1.409), and we will only put important backported bug fixes. We’ll keep releasing 1.409.2, 1.409.3, and so on, as such bugs appear, and in several months (our current thinking is 3 months) we’ll designate another release and repeat this process all over again. I think it provides more comfortable upgrade path for larger deployments. For more about this, see Wiki.\n\nIn large companies that use Jenkins in a large scale, there often is a team of people who looks at incoming Jenkins release, tests it with their environments and their plugins, and then let their internal group consume them. With this release line, I’m calling for them to join the effort on this branch. Vojtech Juranek from Red Hat is already helping us tremendously, so is Yahoo in choosing the base release line and backporting. But it’d be great to get more people on board, as I think it’ll benefit everyone to have a larger number of eyeballs on the same code.
