When I sent out a message asking for users of Hudson in the corporate space to ping me about doing a \"spotlight\" on them, ITA Software stuck out in particular; they’re hiring a Hudson expert!\n\nThe format for the \"spotlight\" series isn’t entirely nailed down yet so feel free to ask questions in the comments section and I’ll follow-up with Matt after the fact if need be. That said, without further delay, Matt Girard from ITA Software, on Hudson.\n--- Hudson Matt, appreciate you taking the time to answer some questions about Hudson at ITA Software, let’s start with a simple one: How long has ITA been using Hudson?\n\nMatt My pleasure, glad to be a part of the community. We have been using Hudson in some form since early 2008. Predictably our usage has increased over time and now encompasses the majority of our automated build and test infrastructure.\n\nHudson Was continuous integration a part of ITA’s workflow prior to adopting Hudson? If so: what did ITA switch to Hudson from, and why?\n\nMatt Yes, though not to the degree that we have now. Prior to Hudson we were reliant on BuildBot for our automated builds, but we were not doing continuous integration\n across our components until after the transition to Hudson. The easy to understand UI and flexibility were primary features that compelled our switch. I should mention\n that when we decided to switch we also evaluated CruiseControl but Hudson came out on top for our needs.\n\nHudson What kind of projects are you typically using Hudson for? What\nlanguages/build system(s)? What platforms is Hudson performing builds? What kinds of jobs primarily run on ITA’s Hudson cluster?\n\nMatt Our Hudson environments (yes, we have more than one) have been optimized for building C++, Java (all maven based), Lisp (a surprise to some to be sure more about that here), and Python on Linux build agents (Fedora and CentOS).\n\nOur jobs are (loosely) grouped into one of three categories: rpm (we are primarily RedHat based), tests, and tools. The rpm jobs are the actual code builds and individual component unit tests. The test jobs (thank you parameterized trigger plugin!) are part of a larger cross-component integration testing and promotion scheme. The (handful of) tools jobs support us in tasks such as cleaning up stale sandbox database connections.\n\nHudson Given the flexibility of Hudson, it’s safe to say that not everybody is using it in the exact same fashion, is there anything you would consider interesting or noteworthy about the use of Hudson at ITA?\n\nMatt I think that our most interesting usage of Hudson has to be how we have combined parameterized builds with the parameterized trigger plugin in order to do cross-component testing of trunk code. More specifically, we pass a properties file (to us a \"scoreboard\" that tells the jobs what exact revisions of which projects to\n test together) to several jobs and only build a final promotion job if ALL of downstream jobs (with the same scoreboard) passed. In this way we create a hurdle that all of our code must clear before we even consider deploying it anywhere else.\n\nThe next most interesting thing we are doing is using Hudson for continuous deployment of monitoring changes into our staging environment. It’s quite rewarding to watch a check-in makes it’s way through Hudson, into and rpm, and out to a server without a human being involved.\n\nHudson Are there any additional tools ITA has written to better integrate things \"behind the scenes\"?\n\nMatt We evolved what became a very large build script (mostly derived from what we had for BuildBot) that handles all of the nitty-gritty details involved in the building, packaging, and testing of our software. Recently we have been working to refactor this into several smaller build tools each with a more focused purpose. The first of these is designed (largely as a wrapper to rpmbuild) to standardize our package building while leaving the .spec files (with the real specifics) living alongside the code where they belong.\n\nHudson On a scale from 1-10, how important would you rate Hudson for ITA’s\nday-to-day workflow?\n\nMatt ITA is a decent size company and there is plenty of work that goes on that does not involve Hudson in any way. Still since we rely on the building and testing that Hudson does in order to promote new code to production, I would say that we are somewhere around an 8.\n\nI’d like to thank Matt again for being a good sport as the very first in what I hope will be a long line of \"spotlights\" on companies using Hudson to help them work smart, better and faster.

Code and resources are often kept in version control, but it can be easy to forget your continuous integration (CI) server itself! If a disk were to die or fall victim to a misplaced rm -rf, you could lose all the history and configuration associated with the jobs your CI server manages.\n\nIt’s pretty simple to create a repository, but it isn’t obvious which parts of your $HUDSON_HOME you’ll want to backup. You’ll also want to have some automation so new projects get added to the repository, and deleted ones get removed. Luckily we have a great tool to handle this: Hudson!\n\nWe have a Hudson job which runs nightly, performs the appropriate SVN commands, and checks in. The high-level overview of this job is basically:\n\nAdd any new jobs, users, plugin configurations, et cetera: svn add -q --parents.xml jobs/ /config.xml users/ /config.xml userContent/\n\nRemove anything from SVN that no longer exists (such as a deleted job): svn status | grep '!' | awk '{print $2;}' | xargs -r svn rm\n\nCheck it in! svn ci --non-interactive --username=mrhudson -m \"automated commit of Hudson configuration\"\nYou’ll want to make sure to use the --non-interactive option for any automated svn operations, as this ensures Subversion won’t hang asking a question but instead fail immediately. You may also need to provide your password with the --password option.\n\nTo make such a Hudson job, create a new job, tie it to the controller (since this is where the configuration files are), set it to build periodically (we use “@midnight”), and add an “Execute shell” build step. Here’s the full script we use, to put into the build step:\n\n# Change into your HUDSON_HOME.\ncd /opt/hudson\n# Add any new conf files, jobs, users, and content.\nsvn add -q --parents *.xml jobs/*/config.xml users/*/config.xml userContent/*\n# Ignore things in the root we don't care about.\necho -e \"warnlogn*.logn*.tmpn*.oldn*.bakn*.jarn*.json\" > myignores\nsvn propset svn:ignore -F myignores . && rm myignores\n# Ignore things in jobs/* we don't care about.\necho -e \"buildsnlast*nnext*n*.txtn*.lognworkspace*ncoberturanjavadocnhtmlreportsnncoverndoclinks\" > myignores\nsvn propset svn:ignore -F myignores jobs/* && rm myignores\n# Remove anything from SVN that no longer exists in Hudson.\nsvn status | grep '!' | awk '{print $2;}' | xargs -r svn rm\n# And finally, check in of course, showing status before and after for logging.\nsvn st && svn ci --non-interactive --username=mrhudson -m \"automated commit of Hudson configuration\" && svn st\n\nYou’ll notice this does some extra things like set the svn:ignores property to provide a relatively clean svn st which it shows before and after the commit for logging purposes. One thing this job doesn’t do is put the build results of your jobs in version control. Because historical build logs and artifacts will never change and are also potentially large, a periodic (daily or weekly) cp or rsync of the jobs directory will still give you restorability while keeping your repository lean.\n\nNow you can sleep well at night knowing that your CI server is safe and sound. If you are doing a similar thing with Hudson or another CI system, let us know about your solution!\n\nEditor’s Note: Mike Rooney is a Software Engineer at Genius.com, provider of real-time marketing automation software connecting marketing and sales.

We owe a special thanks to the wonderful folks over at Atlassian - we’re taking advantage of their generous open source license for our bug tracking ( JIRA), wiki ( Confluence), and source repository browser ( FishEye). Obviously, there’s a lot more we can improve going forward - I’ll have another post up soon, looking at some of the ideas we’re kicking around. But for now, take a look at what we’ve already done, below the fold.\n\nThe Hudson war and plugin downloads have all moved off of the unreliable java.net to our own [hudson-ci.org]( https://hudson-ci.org) with the downloads being powered by the same system used for distributing Java, OpenSolaris, and NetBeans. Downloading Hudson and/or plugins is now easier and more reliable.\n\nWe’ve moved issue tracking from java.net’s system to our own JIRA instance, at [issues.hudson-ci.org]( https://issues.hudson-ci.org). As with moving downloads off java.net, we’ve made reporting and browsing Hudson’s issues much faster, easier and more reliable, while still using the same authentication on the back-end as our Subversion and Maven repositories. We’re still working out some kinks in the system but since we’re running our own issue tracker now, rather than using one we didn’t have control over, we’ve got the flexibility we need to adapt our tools to best serve the developer and user communities.\n\nSpeaking of tools we now run ourselves, we’ve put up our own FishEye instance at [fisheye.hudson-ci.org]( https://fisheye.hudson-ci.org) - until that was in place, we’d been relying on Atlassian’s public FishEye instance, which has many other open source projects' repositories available. Getting our own server up means we don’t have to bug the generous folks over at Atlassian every time the java.net SVN server confuses FishEye into failing to update. It also opens the door for us to use Crucible for code review in the future.\n\nHudson’s moved onto Twitter more and more over the last 6-9 months - we’ve got the always fabulous @hudsonci, tweeting new releases, Hudson-related tweets, and more, as well as the #hudsonci hashtag.\n\nThis may not strictly be infrastructure but it’s worth mentioning that we’ve now got native packages and distribution for Hudson for Ubuntu/Debian, Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS, openSUSE, OpenSolaris/Nevada, and FreeBSD.\n\nThis is all in addition to key parts of our infrastructure that haven’t changed: our official wiki, our user and developer mailing lists, our Subversion repository (and a Git mirror on GitHub) and our IRC channel over on Freenode.\n\nOh, and I hear there’s a blog now too.\n\nEditor’s Note: *Andrew Bayer ( abayer) has been a contributor to Hudson since early 2009, contributing to the ClearCase plugin, Hudson’s core and a small number of other plugins. Andrew also helps Kohsuke with a lot of Hudson’s project infrastructure, most notably the migration from Bugzilla on Java.net to JIRA running at issues.hudson-ci.org *","title":"What's going on with the Hudson's infrastructure","tags":["development","core","feedback","just for fun"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Additionally, 1.344 removes the \"easter egg\" background image I wrote about in a post to my personal blog: Mourning Sun Enough of the small talk, here’s the breakdown.\n\nBugs fixed\n\nRemoved the forced upper casing in parameterized builds. ( issue 5391)\n\nPassword parameter on the disk should be encrypted. ( issue 5420)\n\nDuplicate entries on Upstream/Downstream project with \"Build modules in parallel\". ( issue 5293)\n\n\"Projects tied on\" should be \"Projects tied to\". ( issue 5451)\n\nFixed the bug that prevents update center metadata retrieval in Jetty. ( issue 5210)\n\nEnhancements\n\nShow which plugins have already been upgraded in Plugin Manager. ( issue 2313)\n\nShow Hudson upgrade status on manage page instead of offering same upgrade again. ( issue 3055)\n\nMake badges in build history line up. ( report)\n\nContributors\n\nThis release of Hudson contained 44 commits from 5 different contributors to \"core\":\n\nabayer\n\nkohsuke\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nhuybrechts\n\nAs usual, you can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.\n\nUpdate: This post was written a day before issue 5536 was discovered. I recommend waiting until 1.345 to update any production Hudson instances.","title":"Hudson 1.344 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

If you\ndon’t mind me saying so, I think its arrival is long overdue. Since Hudson\nstarted in November of 2006, there hasn’t been a central \"voice\" for the\nproject. In just a few short years Hudson has grown into a substantial project\nwith hundreds of plugins and thousands of users around the world.\nKohsuke 's\nnice Java-based extensible continuous integration server has grown up into\nfantastic tool with a great community around it.\n\nGoals for this weblog\n\nI think it is important to set out a couple of goals for this weblog, some simple items that should help guide the content and discussion around Continuous Blog and its future.\n\nContinuous Blog should:\n\nHelp advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community\n\nBe a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson users of all skill-levels\n\nRecognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their efforts\n\nWhat to expect\n\nAs Continuous Blog grows and matures, you can expect to see a variety of Hudson-related content. Overviews of the latest releases of Hudson and its plugins, interviews and discussions with the developers who have contributed to Hudson over the years, guest posts by power-users on how Hudson fits into their workflow and much much more (really).\n\nIf you look around the page you’ll already see a good amount of content, in the\nsidebar to the right you’ll notice the \"Recently Released\" section which\naggregates recently released plugins via this RSS\nfeed, the \"Blogs\"\nsection which is an aggregation of Hudson community blogs (from this RSS\nfeed).\n\nWe’re just starting out so make sure you subscribe to the RSS feed, we’ve got a lot to talk about here on Continuous Blog.","title":"Welcome to Continuous Blog!","tags":["core","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
