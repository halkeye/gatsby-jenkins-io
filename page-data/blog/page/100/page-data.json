The release contains primarily bug-fixes but has a few enhancements baked into it as well. As mentioned in \" [Incoming! More Translations\", 1.344 incorporates a number of community-driven translations (see the other post for more information). Additionally, 1.344 removes the \"easter egg\" background image I wrote about in a post to my personal blog: Mourning Sun Enough of the small talk, here’s the breakdown.\n\nBugs fixed\n\nRemoved the forced upper casing in parameterized builds. ( issue 5391)\n\nPassword parameter on the disk should be encrypted. ( issue 5420)\n\nDuplicate entries on Upstream/Downstream project with \"Build modules in parallel\". ( issue 5293)\n\n\"Projects tied on\" should be \"Projects tied to\". ( issue 5451)\n\nFixed the bug that prevents update center metadata retrieval in Jetty. ( issue 5210)\n\nEnhancements\n\nShow which plugins have already been upgraded in Plugin Manager. ( issue 2313)\n\nShow Hudson upgrade status on manage page instead of offering same upgrade again. ( issue 3055)\n\nMake badges in build history line up. ( report)\n\nContributors\n\nThis release of Hudson contained 44 commits from 5 different contributors to \"core\":\n\nabayer\n\nkohsuke\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nhuybrechts\n\nAs usual, you can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.\n\nUpdate: This post was written a day before issue 5536 was discovered. I recommend waiting until 1.345 to update any production Hudson instances.","title":"Hudson 1.344 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

If you\ndon’t mind me saying so, I think its arrival is long overdue. Since Hudson\nstarted in November of 2006, there hasn’t been a central \"voice\" for the\nproject. In just a few short years Hudson has grown into a substantial project\nwith hundreds of plugins and thousands of users around the world.\nKohsuke 's\nnice Java-based extensible continuous integration server has grown up into\nfantastic tool with a great community around it.\n\nGoals for this weblog\n\nI think it is important to set out a couple of goals for this weblog, some simple items that should help guide the content and discussion around Continuous Blog and its future.\n\nContinuous Blog should:\n\nHelp advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community\n\nBe a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson users of all skill-levels\n\nRecognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their efforts\n\nWhat to expect\n\nAs Continuous Blog grows and matures, you can expect to see a variety of Hudson-related content. Overviews of the latest releases of Hudson and its plugins, interviews and discussions with the developers who have contributed to Hudson over the years, guest posts by power-users on how Hudson fits into their workflow and much much more (really).\n\nIf you look around the page you’ll already see a good amount of content, in the\nsidebar to the right you’ll notice the \"Recently Released\" section which\naggregates recently released plugins via this RSS\nfeed, the \"Blogs\"\nsection which is an aggregation of Hudson community blogs (from this RSS\nfeed).\n\nWe’re just starting out so make sure you subscribe to the RSS feed, we’ve got a lot to talk about here on Continuous Blog.","title":"Welcome to Continuous Blog!","tags":["core","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
