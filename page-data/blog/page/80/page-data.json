Kinoshita ]\n\nJenkins will be represented at this years Bioinformatics Open Source Conference ( BOSC 2012) on July 13-14th in Long Beach, California. I will be talking about Jenkins during my talk about BioUno.\n\nBOSC 2012 will be held just before ISMB 2012, while registration is through ISMB you don’t have to register for ISMB in order to register for BOSC.\n\nI will be at the event with some Jenkins stickers and available to answer questions you might have about BioUno and Jenkins!\n\nAbout BioUno\n\nBioUno is a project that uses Jenkins as basis for building\nbiology workflows.\nBioUno provides an alternative update center with custom plug-ins for\nbioinformatics tools like\nMrBayes,\nStructure,\nFigtree,\nBeast,\namong others.\n\nWhile the actual task of analysing or displaying data is handled by specific\ntools, that are wrapped by plug-ins, Jenkins is responsible for user control,\nweb interface, notifications, distributed execution, job schedule and\nmanagement, as well as other important low level tasks.\n\nBioUno is similar to BioHPC,\nGalaxy and\nTaverna, in that all these tools enable creating and managing pipelines using different bioinformatics tools.\n\nHowever, as it is using Jenkins, BioUno has the advantage of having an Open Source community of hackers that can answer questions and provide assistance for creating new plug-ins. There is plenty documentation for extending Jenkins\nand troubleshooting issues, as well as plenty existing plug-ins (that can be used as reference while writing new plug-ins).\n\nThere are projects and plug-ins that enable Jenkins to use resources in clouds or turn Jenkins into a Hadoop node, for big data processing. The next steps of the project include the deployment of BioUno to a computer facility, basic infrastructure for BioUno, definition of the process for releasing plug-ins, the creation of more plug-ins and a study on how to handle large data structures, used by many bioinformatics tools.\n\nThe project is being developed by TupiLabs under MIT License, and contributions and new plug-ins are welcome.","title":"Jenkins and Bioinformatics, catch us at BOSC 2012","tags":["general","cia","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

A hundred other like-minded continuous integration enthusiasts and I packed a very posh Marriott Marquis for a full day of Jenkins excitement.\n\nFamed Hudson and Jenkins founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi delivered the opening address to a crowded room.\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zONIv2yCm1s/T7pLy0yCalI/AAAAAAAAANg/hXadCIg5XC0/s1600/kohsuke.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zONIv2yCm1s/T7pLy0yCalI/AAAAAAAAANg/hXadCIg5XC0/s320/kohsuke.jpg[image,width=239,height=320]]\n\n+\nI'm sure everyone knows the statistics by now, that Jenkins adoption and development continues at an unbridled pace. Pushing past all the mailing list users and posts, the JIRAs opening and closing, the Twitter followers, the *five* Jenkins User Conferences scheduled for this year, the unprecedented number of installations reporting anonymous usage, the native availability for *nine* different OSes, in pushing past all of that.. +\n +\nFor me, the most impressive number was that on average there was about 1 plugin created every day over the past year. Let me reiterate that: *1 plugin created every day for a year*. If that isn't the best testament to the versatility, extensibility, and just plain usefulness of a piece of software, then I don't know what would be! +\n +\nAnnounced at the conference was the general availability of https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees BuildHive], this is a mechanism for quickly and easily obtaining access to cloud-based Jenkins. If you have projects on https://github.com/[GitHub], you can effortlessly log in to BuildHive via GitHub OAuth, import your projects with literally a single click, and start benefiting from the powerful promise of the cloud. You'll no longer have to worry about managing infrastructure, you'll just get all that great Jenkins CI capability for your projects immediately. +\n +\n +\n +\nWith BuildHive enabled projects, if a user of your project creates a pull request, then it will automatically pre-test that request before it hits the master tree -- https://github.com/jenkinsci/naginator-plugin/pull/2#issuecomment-5732481[commenting inside the pull request] whether or not the change broke the build. If a developer wants to test some changes before pushing them to the master tree, there's the https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb[Validated Merge feature], which can be used to screen commits before they land in master. Both of these features are wickedly awesome, to not use them would be a mistake for any F/OSS community. +\n +\nI would encourage you to try out BuildHive, it's already active for most/all of the Jenkins plugins. There's also an existing https://groups.google.com/d/topic/jenkinsci-dev/kqPAOziY1as/discussion[RFC thread] which is in discussion for making this the de facto location for Jenkins plugin on Jenkins testing. Please give it a shot and then post your comments. +\n +\nAside from this major announcement, I think the most interesting perspective I took away from the conference was the sheer diversity of Jenkins exploitation. People are using it on all sorts of hardware platforms, from mobile to cloud, on all sorts of languages from Java and C/C++ to Python and Ruby. I was also impressed with how many teams are using Jenkins as part of their mission critical business process. +\n +\nFinally, I'd like to thank all the Jenkins developers and users for making it the best continuous integration software available today.

While many are French, some of the attendees come from all over the Europe. I was able to see some familiar faces, as well as those who I've only known by their names. +\n +\n\n+\nI tried to get in and out of both tracks to get the sense of what's going on, so that I can report them later, and here's my notes. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/75/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423121146-816f0806.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI kicked off the whole day with a keynote, looking back what we've done since we became Jenkins. I've looked into various activities in the community, such as LTS, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program[Jenkins CIA], https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+in+Ruby[Ruby plugin development], and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/UI+Enhancements[UI enhancements]. I updated my adoption statistics slides (we are happy to report that we crossed https://imod.github.com/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html[40K installations] in our tracking), and reported that JFrog is now https://java.dzone.com/announcements/jenkins-ci-and-jfrog-announce[hosting our repositories] that we rely on for the development. I showed some of what we've been lately working on at CloudBees — such as the upcoming version of https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb[Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees] that support high-availability, https://www.cloudbees.com/press-room/cloudbees-donates-five-plugins-jenkins-community.cb[our giving away the folder plugin for free] (as in beer), and previews of some not quite public yet features, which is a treat only for those who came! +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/89/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423123054-9f4acaef.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIn the first slot, https://twitter.com/gboissinot/[Gregory Boissinot] went through a plugin development workshop. This was actually something I really wanted to understand, so that I get the objective view on where the pitfalls are. Even though the talk was in French, I did understand the code he was showing, and I took some notes about having some kind of skeleton code generator — for example, there's a common pattern for building an UI bound model object (for asking the user to enter data that has structures, persisting them, and so on), and having a code generator command line tool (like https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins.rb[jenkins.rb] has) could be really handy. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/93/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423123825-9ef5019f.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIn another room, https://twitter.com/ndeloof[Nicolas] and Mathieu were showing their https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin[\"build flow\"] plugin, which lets you write a workflow in Groovy DSL. Choreographing a complex workflow that involves multiple jobs is a commoon challenge among any Jenkins users, and so this talk was well attended, and I'm really looking forward to seeing this plugin mature (there's https://cisco.webex.com/ciscosales/lsr.php?AT=pb&SP=MC&rID=60616172&rKey=7caa63dde29ef758[a separate effort] to integrate BPMN workflow into Jenkins, see more about that here.) One thing I learned about Groovy DSL since then is the AST transformation. I'm thinking it might allow us to convert the DSL workflow script into a continuation passing style so that you can suspend/resume workflow at arbitrary point. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/106/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423125816-eb3613bb.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThe day was so packed that we didn't even waste the lunch time! While attendees are eating, we had lightening talks in the room. Olivier showed off how Apache runs Jenkins, which is quite sizable, then I pitched in for https://twitter.com/4imod[Domonik], who couldn't make it to the conference, and covered the scriptler plugin. Vincent followed and covered the similar Groovy system console. Harpreet then closed off the lunch lightening talks by showing the templates plugin in Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/111/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423130341-35bbfbae.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIn the afternoon, https://twitter.com/aheritier[Arnaud], one of our French gangs, showed how you can set up the iOS development on Jenkins (from code change to test to the delivery of the binaries to actual phones.) Bruno then did a demo of how he uses DEV@cloud and RUN@cloud to quickly set up continuous deployment for Java webapps. For system integraters that deal with lots of projects, I think it is a great combination (for example allowing you to hand over the entire development environment to the customer when the project is over.) +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/140/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423133439-5a7b4fbe.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nWhile all that is going on in one room, in another room Lars Kruse showed off how the old meets the new — where you https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/ClearCase+UCM+Plugin[take ClearCase UCM and use it to do validated merge], in which only the changes tested by Jenkins become visible to the rest of the team. I personally don't know much about ClearCase, but it was very interesting that emerging techniques like validated merge can be applied on more traditional SCM tools. He also said his company works with clients to develop custom Jenkins plugins. I always felt that any big company adopting Jenkins need some custom glue plugins, and I regularly come across those companies, but CloudBees can only help so many. It's great to see that there are more help available now! +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/188/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423164957-bae4f4ad.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n\n+\nThe talk that followed was from https://twitter.com/#!/jcarsique[Julien Carsique] from Nuxeo, discussing how he manages and improves the CI environment for his organization. Now, I regret I didn't take all the notes about details, but I think this was one of the best presentations of the day for me. I remember thinking that if we had the best Jenkins administrator award for those who push things to the limit and beyond, he would be my top pick. IIRC, he had a major Maven projects that span across different repos and all. He set up Jenkins such that any change triggers a cascade of new builds of downstream jobs, which later then fan out to cross-platform test jobs, then he made the whole thing visualized so you can track exactly where the time is spent and how those changes propagate. I think this was very inspirational to many other fellow Jenkins users, and I hope he will put his slides somewhere so that other people can mimic what he's done. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/144/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423134050-8dd4dca8.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n\n+\nBack to the big room, my fellow colleagues https://twitter.com/#!/connolly_s[Stephen] and https://twitter.com/#!/singh_harpreet[Harpreet] did the only introductory talk in the whole day, going through check lists of production Jenkins deployments, recapping why you want CI, etc. (And I always forget that there are still many who don't know much about Jenkins!) +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/156/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423135955-e072a9a0.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIt was also great to see and hear https://sebastian-bergmann.de/[Sebastian Bergmann], the guy behind https://jenkins-php.org/[Jenkins PHP], talk about Jenkins and PHP integrations. I wish we had more of those people who bridge our community to different communities and help us spread the ideas. He even kindly gave me his Jenkins/PHP book and signed it for me! +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/159/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423140457-1e3a42c8.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n\n+\nAside from talks, food was great, especially for those of us who came from the U.S. I've got some good inspirations about where we need to work. And I also managed to implement the search filter in the update center during the day, in response to the valid complaint from Sebastian. For virtual communities like ours, it's really good to meet people in the meat space and put faces on names. Build automation engineers are often somewhat lonely in their respective organizations — there just aren't that many people who get excited about automating things away, and so having so many of like-minded folks in one room was by itself a great experience. +\n +\n\n+\nOn the things to improve side, I felt that workshops was tricky to do in a limited time and in a big room. Maybe it would work out better if there's a smaller room where smaller number of people can gather and hack away (probably some time slots designated for some specific topics), then we can collectively merge pending important pull requests, teaching how to develop plugins, or ask others to look at their plugins, etc. There also can be a valid discussion about JUC, run nicely in exchange of admission fee, vs JUC run cheaply but free. +\n +\n\n+\nIn any case, I think the quality of presentations were very good, and knowing local Jenkins developers/users would help expand your horizon.

Jenkins is starting to get to be that age, having been started over 6 years ago.\n\nOne of the most commonly asked questions, is about Jenkins' use of \"blue balls\" to indicate success by default. This is enough of an \"issue\" for some users that the Green Balls plugin is in the list of top 10 installed plugins.\n\nThe reason behind our use of blue to indicate success has its basis in Kohsuke’s Japanese upbringing. The cultural differences were enumerated in a bug report comically titled \"s/blue/green/g\" ( JENKINS-369):\n\nThis response Kohsuke cited was taken from this Q&A thread\n\nQ.\" Why do Japanese people say that they have blue traffic lights when they are really green?\" --Question submitted by John Sypal\n\nA: According to the book, Japan From A to Z: Mysteries of Everyday\nLife Explained by James and Michiko Vardaman, the first traffic\nsignals in Japan were blue instead of green, but the blue lights were difficult to see from a long distance away so they were replaced with green ones. Vardaman says that the custom of referring to traffic lights is a holdover from those days.\n\nThis sounds like a good explanation, but the problem with it is that you will hear Japanese people refer to other green things (like\ncucumbers, spinach, and sometimes grass) as being blue as well. This\nis because historically, Japanese people considered green to be a\nshade of blue. For example, the Chinese character for blue,\npronounced ao is made up of two characters, iki (life) and i (well)\nand refers to the colour of plants which grow around a well, a colour between green and blue. When Chinese people see the character, they say it means green, but Japanese people say it means blue.\n\nJapanese books on colours tell us that there are four tertiary colours: red, blue, white and black, and that all others are shades of those four main ones. Ao, therefore, is a sort of ideal blue, halfway between green and blue. The sky is said to be blue, but it is a different shade of ao than a traffic light is. Tree leaves are said to be green, but green is a shade of ao, like crimson is a shade of red.\n\nIn another interesting cultural difference relating\nto colour, Japanese children always colour the sun red instead of\nyellow.\n\n( here’s a direct link to Kohsuke’s comment )\n\nUnfortunately it’s not for color blind users, although that’s a pretty convincing explanation. Jenkins has blue balls because in Japan, red means stop and blue means go!\n\nImage courtesy of this site","title":"Why does Jenkins have blue balls?","tags":["general","just for fun","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
