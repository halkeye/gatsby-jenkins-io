For the non-French speakers, we’re looking for French speakers to help translate \"Jenkins: The Definitive Guide\" ]\n\nSi vous vous intéressez à Jenkins et que vous aimeriez pouvoir y contribuer, lisez la suite.\n\nL’année dernière, en août, nous avons attaqué la traduction en français du Jenkins Definitive Guide, écrit en bonne partie par John Ferguson Smart. Le travail a avancé doucement, mais a avancé tout de même. A ce jour, sur la quinzaine de\nchapitres, trois sont traduits et relus, et presque tout le reste est en cours.\n\nMais je ne parle pas bien anglais…​\n\nCe n’est pas grave. Il y a plusieurs chapitres où il faut simplement relire, et donc parler et écrire correctement le français est suffisant. Si éventuellement, vous ne comprenez pas certaines parties traduites, et qu’il faut relire l’original, vous pouvez toujours soulever la question sur la liste de diffusion du projet où on parle français.\n\nJe ne suis pas développeur, ou je ne connais pas Git, ou les deux\n\nSi vous voulez vous former à Git, c’est l’occasion. On se fera un plaisir de répondre à vos questions sur la liste de diffusion, même si elles sont exclusivement liées à Git, et pas (encore) à la traduction :-).\n\nMais si vous ne le sentez pas ou n’avez pas le temps, ce n’est pas grave. Vous devez simplement savoir éditer un fichier XML. Il y en a un pour chaque chapitre.\n\nSuper ! Par où je commence alors ?\n\nComment se signaler :\n\nIl y a une page wiki qui récapitule l’état de la traduction, chapitre par chapitre. Indiquez votre nom en tant que relecteur, et c’est parti.\n\nSi vous le souhaitez, mais ce n’est pas une obligation, vous pouvez vous présenter sur la liste de diffusion du projet.\n\nComment relire les chapitres ?\n\nLe plus simple est de lire la version HTML publiée en continu grâce à CloudBees.\n\nComment faire part de mes corrections ? Deux solutions :\n\nGit : vous forkez le projet GitHub : Jenkins - Le Guide Complet, vous créez une branche pour la relecture, vous committez vos vos corrections, et vous faites une pull-request.\n\nCopiez le fichier XML du chapitre qui vous intéresse à partir de la page du projet puis vous l’envoyez sur la liste de diffusion lorsque vous avez fini.\n\nSi vous êtes intéressé, mais que vous avez des questions, surtout n’hésitez pas à les poser.\n\nOn vous attend ! :-)","title":"Jenkins a besoin de vous","tags":["general","feedback","guest post"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"e0cc9ba8-3326-5aed-8316-79df370e3fb5","slug":"/blog/2012/05/21/nyc-jenkins-user-conference-recap/","strippedHtml":"Editor’s Note: The following is a write-up courtesy of Jesse Farinacci\n\nThis past week I had the pleasure of attending the Jenkins User Conference in NYC. A hundred other like-minded continuous integration enthusiasts and I packed a very posh Marriott Marquis for a full day of Jenkins excitement.\n\nFamed Hudson and Jenkins founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi delivered the opening address to a crowded room.\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zONIv2yCm1s/T7pLy0yCalI/AAAAAAAAANg/hXadCIg5XC0/s1600/kohsuke.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zONIv2yCm1s/T7pLy0yCalI/AAAAAAAAANg/hXadCIg5XC0/s320/kohsuke.jpg[image,width=239,height=320]]\n\n+\nI'm sure everyone knows the statistics by now, that Jenkins adoption and development continues at an unbridled pace. Pushing past all the mailing list users and posts, the JIRAs opening and closing, the Twitter followers, the *five* Jenkins User Conferences scheduled for this year, the unprecedented number of installations reporting anonymous usage, the native availability for *nine* different OSes, in pushing past all of that.. +\n +\nFor me, the most impressive number was that on average there was about 1 plugin created every day over the past year. Let me reiterate that: *1 plugin created every day for a year*. If that isn't the best testament to the versatility, extensibility, and just plain usefulness of a piece of software, then I don't know what would be! +\n +\nAnnounced at the conference was the general availability of https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees BuildHive], this is a mechanism for quickly and easily obtaining access to cloud-based Jenkins. If you have projects on https://github.com/[GitHub], you can effortlessly log in to BuildHive via GitHub OAuth, import your projects with literally a single click, and start benefiting from the powerful promise of the cloud. You'll no longer have to worry about managing infrastructure, you'll just get all that great Jenkins CI capability for your projects immediately. +\n +\n +\n +\nWith BuildHive enabled projects, if a user of your project creates a pull request, then it will automatically pre-test that request before it hits the master tree -- https://github.com/jenkinsci/naginator-plugin/pull/2#issuecomment-5732481[commenting inside the pull request] whether or not the change broke the build. If a developer wants to test some changes before pushing them to the master tree, there's the https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb[Validated Merge feature], which can be used to screen commits before they land in master. Both of these features are wickedly awesome, to not use them would be a mistake for any F/OSS community. +\n +\nI would encourage you to try out BuildHive, it's already active for most/all of the Jenkins plugins. There's also an existing https://groups.google.com/d/topic/jenkinsci-dev/kqPAOziY1as/discussion[RFC thread] which is in discussion for making this the de facto location for Jenkins plugin on Jenkins testing. Please give it a shot and then post your comments. +\n +\nAside from this major announcement, I think the most interesting perspective I took away from the conference was the sheer diversity of Jenkins exploitation. People are using it on all sorts of hardware platforms, from mobile to cloud, on all sorts of languages from Java and C/C++ to Python and Ruby. I was also impressed with how many teams are using Jenkins as part of their mission critical business process. +\n +\nFinally, I'd like to thank all the Jenkins developers and users for making it the best continuous integration software available today.

While many are French, some of the attendees come from all over the Europe. I was able to see some familiar faces, as well as those who I've only known by their names. +\n +\n\n+\nI tried to get in and out of both tracks to get the sense of what's going on, so that I can report them later, and here's my notes. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/75/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423121146-816f0806.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI kicked off the whole day with a keynote, looking back what we've done since we became Jenkins. I've looked into various activities in the community, such as LTS, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program[Jenkins CIA], https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+in+Ruby[Ruby plugin development], and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/UI+Enhancements[UI enhancements]. I updated my adoption statistics slides (we are happy to report that we crossed https://imod.github.com/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html[40K installations] in our tracking), and reported that JFrog is now https://java.dzone.com/announcements/jenkins-ci-and-jfrog-announce[hosting our repositories] that we rely on for the development. I showed some of what we've been lately working on at CloudBees — such as the upcoming version of https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb[Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees] that support high-availability, https://www.cloudbees.com/press-room/cloudbees-donates-five-plugins-jenkins-community.cb[our giving away the folder plugin for free] (as in beer), and previews of some not quite public yet features, which is a treat only for those who came! +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/89/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423123054-9f4acaef.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIn the first slot, https://twitter.com/gboissinot/[Gregory Boissinot] went through a plugin development workshop. This was actually something I really wanted to understand, so that I get the objective view on where the pitfalls are. Even though the talk was in French, I did understand the code he was showing, and I took some notes about having some kind of skeleton code generator — for example, there's a common pattern for building an UI bound model object (for asking the user to enter data that has structures, persisting them, and so on), and having a code generator command line tool (like https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins.rb[jenkins.rb] has) could be really handy. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/93/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423123825-9ef5019f.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIn another room, https://twitter.com/ndeloof[Nicolas] and Mathieu were showing their https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin[\"build flow\"] plugin, which lets you write a workflow in Groovy DSL. Choreographing a complex workflow that involves multiple jobs is a commoon challenge among any Jenkins users, and so this talk was well attended, and I'm really looking forward to seeing this plugin mature (there's https://cisco.webex.com/ciscosales/lsr.php?AT=pb&SP=MC&rID=60616172&rKey=7caa63dde29ef758[a separate effort] to integrate BPMN workflow into Jenkins, see more about that here.) One thing I learned about Groovy DSL since then is the AST transformation. I'm thinking it might allow us to convert the DSL workflow script into a continuation passing style so that you can suspend/resume workflow at arbitrary point. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/106/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423125816-eb3613bb.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThe day was so packed that we didn't even waste the lunch time! While attendees are eating, we had lightening talks in the room. Olivier showed off how Apache runs Jenkins, which is quite sizable, then I pitched in for https://twitter.com/4imod[Domonik], who couldn't make it to the conference, and covered the scriptler plugin. Vincent followed and covered the similar Groovy system console. Harpreet then closed off the lunch lightening talks by showing the templates plugin in Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/111/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423130341-35bbfbae.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIn the afternoon, https://twitter.com/aheritier[Arnaud], one of our French gangs, showed how you can set up the iOS development on Jenkins (from code change to test to the delivery of the binaries to actual phones.) Bruno then did a demo of how he uses DEV@cloud and RUN@cloud to quickly set up continuous deployment for Java webapps. For system integraters that deal with lots of projects, I think it is a great combination (for example allowing you to hand over the entire development environment to the customer when the project is over.) +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/140/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423133439-5a7b4fbe.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nWhile all that is going on in one room, in another room Lars Kruse showed off how the old meets the new — where you https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/ClearCase+UCM+Plugin[take ClearCase UCM and use it to do validated merge], in which only the changes tested by Jenkins become visible to the rest of the team. I personally don't know much about ClearCase, but it was very interesting that emerging techniques like validated merge can be applied on more traditional SCM tools. He also said his company works with clients to develop custom Jenkins plugins. I always felt that any big company adopting Jenkins need some custom glue plugins, and I regularly come across those companies, but CloudBees can only help so many. It's great to see that there are more help available now! +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/188/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423164957-bae4f4ad.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n\n+\nThe talk that followed was from https://twitter.com/#!/jcarsique[Julien Carsique] from Nuxeo, discussing how he manages and improves the CI environment for his organization. Now, I regret I didn't take all the notes about details, but I think this was one of the best presentations of the day for me. I remember thinking that if we had the best Jenkins administrator award for those who push things to the limit and beyond, he would be my top pick. IIRC, he had a major Maven projects that span across different repos and all. He set up Jenkins such that any change triggers a cascade of new builds of downstream jobs, which later then fan out to cross-platform test jobs, then he made the whole thing visualized so you can track exactly where the time is spent and how those changes propagate. I think this was very inspirational to many other fellow Jenkins users, and I hope he will put his slides somewhere so that other people can mimic what he's done. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/144/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423134050-8dd4dca8.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n\n+\nBack to the big room, my fellow colleagues https://twitter.com/#!/connolly_s[Stephen] and https://twitter.com/#!/singh_harpreet[Harpreet] did the only introductory talk in the whole day, going through check lists of production Jenkins deployments, recapping why you want CI, etc. (And I always forget that there are still many who don't know much about Jenkins!) +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/156/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423135955-e072a9a0.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIt was also great to see and hear https://sebastian-bergmann.de/[Sebastian Bergmann], the guy behind https://jenkins-php.org/[Jenkins PHP], talk about Jenkins and PHP integrations. I wish we had more of those people who bridge our community to different communities and help us spread the ideas. He even kindly gave me his Jenkins/PHP book and signed it for me! +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/159/category/2[image:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423140457-1e3a42c8.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n\n+\nAside from talks, food was great, especially for those of us who came from the U.S. I've got some good inspirations about where we need to work. And I also managed to implement the search filter in the update center during the day, in response to the valid complaint from Sebastian. For virtual communities like ours, it's really good to meet people in the meat space and put faces on names. Build automation engineers are often somewhat lonely in their respective organizations — there just aren't that many people who get excited about automating things away, and so having so many of like-minded folks in one room was by itself a great experience. +\n +\n\n+\nOn the things to improve side, I felt that workshops was tricky to do in a limited time and in a big room. Maybe it would work out better if there's a smaller room where smaller number of people can gather and hack away (probably some time slots designated for some specific topics), then we can collectively merge pending important pull requests, teaching how to develop plugins, or ask others to look at their plugins, etc. There also can be a valid discussion about JUC, run nicely in exchange of admission fee, vs JUC run cheaply but free. +\n +\n\n+\nIn any case, I think the quality of presentations were very good, and knowing local Jenkins developers/users would help expand your horizon. As I said in the beginning, we are takin JUC around the world this year. https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-newyork.cb[The one in New York] is just in the next week, followed by Herzelia (Israel), Tokyo, San Francisco, and Antwerp.

Jenkins is starting to get to be that age, having been started over 6 years ago.\n\nOne of the most commonly asked questions, is about Jenkins' use of \"blue balls\" to indicate success by default. This is enough of an \"issue\" for some users that the Green Balls plugin is in the list of top 10 installed plugins.\n\nThe reason behind our use of blue to indicate success has its basis in Kohsuke’s Japanese upbringing. The cultural differences were enumerated in a bug report comically titled \"s/blue/green/g\" ( JENKINS-369):\n\nThis response Kohsuke cited was taken from this Q&A thread\n\nQ.\" Why do Japanese people say that they have blue traffic lights when they are really green?\" --Question submitted by John Sypal\n\nA: According to the book, Japan From A to Z: Mysteries of Everyday\nLife Explained by James and Michiko Vardaman, the first traffic\nsignals in Japan were blue instead of green, but the blue lights were difficult to see from a long distance away so they were replaced with green ones. Vardaman says that the custom of referring to traffic lights is a holdover from those days.\n\nThis sounds like a good explanation, but the problem with it is that you will hear Japanese people refer to other green things (like\ncucumbers, spinach, and sometimes grass) as being blue as well. This\nis because historically, Japanese people considered green to be a\nshade of blue. For example, the Chinese character for blue,\npronounced ao is made up of two characters, iki (life) and i (well)\nand refers to the colour of plants which grow around a well, a colour between green and blue. When Chinese people see the character, they say it means green, but Japanese people say it means blue.\n\nJapanese books on colours tell us that there are four tertiary colours: red, blue, white and black, and that all others are shades of those four main ones. Ao, therefore, is a sort of ideal blue, halfway between green and blue. The sky is said to be blue, but it is a different shade of ao than a traffic light is. Tree leaves are said to be green, but green is a shade of ao, like crimson is a shade of red.\n\nIn another interesting cultural difference relating\nto colour, Japanese children always colour the sun red instead of\nyellow.\n\n( here’s a direct link to Kohsuke’s comment )\n\nUnfortunately it’s not for color blind users, although that’s a pretty convincing explanation. Jenkins has blue balls because in Japan, red means stop and blue means go!\n\nImage courtesy of this site","title":"Why does Jenkins have blue balls?","tags":["general","just for fun","jenkinsci"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","id":"84e982b8-32fd-5c71-9923-2f8e688aebff","slug":"/blog/2012/03/06/critical-security-advisory-in-jenkins-core/","strippedHtml":"+\nWe've identified and fixed a critical security vulnerabilities in +\nJenkins core.

The second major milestone for the project was that we went to FOSDEM 2012, arguably the largest volunteer-organized and operated open source conference on the planet.\n\nWe had a couple of things going on at FOSDEM that merit a mention:\n\nThe Jenkins project had a stand in the K building, the same building where the Free Java, Config and Systems Management, and a few other pertinent dev rooms were located\n\nThe Jenkins project gave away 2 free copies of John Smart’s book: \" Jenkins: The Definitive Guide\" (thanks to O’Reilly!)\n\nCommunity member R. Tyler Croy gave a talk on running the Jenkins project infrastructure with Puppet\n\nThe O’Reilly folks brought 10+ Jenkins books to sell at their stand.\n\nProject founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi and a number of project members held a constructive UI Enhancements discussion.\n\nWe were very fortunate to have so many Jenkins contributors in attendance, who all helped with the Jenkins stand, introducing people to Jenkins and much more.\n\nFOSDEM in their own words\n\n( after the break)\n\nNicholas de Loof :\n\nFOSDEM was for me an opportunity to meet other Jenkins contributors I only knew by IRC nickname. Those two days were awesome to discuss with users on our stand, joke and socialize, as well as having some more technical debates and encourage folks to get involved in the community. Even I couldn’t attend the talks I selected on the conference agenda due to room being full, I really enjoyed this 100% geek weekend.\n\nChristopher Orr :\n\nThe people, the talks, the social events, the sheer size of FOSDEM all make for a pretty inspiring weekend.  And incredibly, it’s all for free.\n\nYou can not help but feel motivated after attending.  You always learn something new, discover myriad projects — in niches you never knew existed — and talk to smart folk from all over.\n\nTalking to people at the Jenkins stand was no different.  Though in a striking number of cases, people had already heard of Jenkins, were big fans and took a clutch of stickers back home for their colleagues.\n\nSpeaking with those who weren’t yet using Jenkins was equally\ninteresting. My favourite was talking to one guy who described a\nparticularly complex workflow; at each step he asked if Jenkins could do it, and I was able to cheerily reply \"yes\" to every single one.\n\nGetting to put faces to names of Jenkins developers was also a huge plus, and resulted in numerous great conversations.\n\nDomi :\n\nIt was great to get some faces to the short names on IRC. Talking to other commiters was awesome, I thought they are cool before I went to FOSDEM, but now I know!\n\nIts was great to talk to people who are using the tools you are working on, there where so many just coming up to say thank you! (?and there where/are by far more then I thought!)\nI know I’m standing on the shoulders of a giant - but I also do feel that my commitment is of value for others too.\n\nFeels great to be part of this community!\n\nR Tyler Croy :\n\nI spent so much time at the stand telling people about Jenkins or showing them, that I only ended up seeing a couple actual sessions the whole weekend.\nThe kinds of people who came to talk to us almost entirely developers of one kind or another, which was really great to talk about how Jenkins can be used effectively for Perl shops, for Python, C++, C#, Java (of course) or even for deployment automation. The spread was a pretty big endorsement, I think, of the extensible nature of the Jenkins plugin ecosystem.\nIn planning for FOSDEM I had urged Kohsuke to order thousands of stickers for the event, and when all was said and done I think we had given away around 1000 stickers to new Jenkins fans, old Jenkins fans and a few folks in the community who were looking forward to going back to their local JUG to share.\n\nI’m looking forward to making the trip to the bitter cold of Brussels in February again next year.\n\nFred G :\n\nFOSDEM had lots of interesting talks and was very well organized (from my point of view) and best of all…​ it’s free! Apart from the talks and nice lineup of speakers, it has been a great opportunity to meet people. People I already knew, some in person, some only from IRC, the mailing list, or as a maintainer of a plugin; but also people thatcame up to the Jenkins stand.\n\nFrom the people that I talked to:\n\n60% knew Jenkins and use it every day (\"Yeah, I know Jenkins. The whole company uses it and nothing works without it!\")\n\n35% had heard of it or were very interested (\"I know Jenkins, but we bought the Atlassian package and now we have to use Bamboo, Jira and Confluence.\" [me mentioning the Jira integration of Jenkins] \"Wow, I really have to try that out and convince our team to switch to Jenkins!\".\n\n5% Weirdos and WTF!? ( disgusted\"Is this another one of these\nprojects funded by Red Hat? They fund everything!\")\n\nMeeting Tom Huybrechts without knowing it (at first) was a big\nsuprise. He has created or contributed to some of the best plugins\n(eg. the parameterized-trigger plugin) and I see his name at least\nonce whenever I browse through core source code. During the impromptu UI enhancement meetings he showed us another three plugins that he wrote but never made public just because he doesn’t have time to support them all.\n\nThen at the stand he casually mentioned that he is administering\naround 3000 jobs on 100+ build machines. At the same time he seems\nlike a very humble and low key character.\n\nTo sum it up, the best thing about an open source project like Jenkins is the community. Working together with nice people from all over the world to create the best CI server has been a great experience. The FOSDEM weekend was another event that proved that.\nI’ll definitely come back.\n\nKohsuke Kawaguchi :\n\nFOSDEM is one of the few conferences that has a distinctive hand-made geek-for-geek feeling to it. No marketing people, no bullshit flyers, but lots of technical folks and good beer. I really enjoyed talking to users, as always, but above all I was very happy to see developers and project members in the Jenkins community come out in full force, and I felt they enjoyed it just as much. I’m really hoping that we’ll now keep this going for years to come.\n\nI think it’s safe to assume we’ll be back next year for FOSDEM 2013, hope to see you there!","title":"FOSDEM 2012 Recap","tags":["general","meetup","news"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":632,"numPages":100,"currentPage":80}},
