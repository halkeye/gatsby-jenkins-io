year ago we delivered a security fix for Jenkins that had the potential to break the entire Jenkins UI.\nWe needed to change how Jenkins, through the Stapler web framework, handled HTTP requests, tightening the rules around what requests would be processed by Jenkins.\nIn the six months since, we didn’t receive notable reports of problems resulting from this change, and it’s thanks to the telemetry we gathered beforehand.\n\nThe Problem\n\nJenkins uses the Stapler web framework for HTTP request handling.\nStapler’s basic premise is that it uses reflective access to code elements matching its naming conventions.\nFor example, any public method whose name starts with get, and that has a String, int, long, or no argument can be invoked this way on objects that are reachable through these means.\nAs these naming conventions closely match common code patterns in Java, accessing crafted URLs could invoke methods never intended to be invoked this way.\n\nA simple example of that is a URL every Jenkins user would be familiar with: /job/jobname.\nThis ends up invoking a method called #getJob(String), with the argument being\"jobname\", on the root application object, and having it handle the rest of the URL, if any.\nOf course, this is a URL intended to be accessed this way.\nHow about invoking Object#getClass(), followed by Class#getClassLoader(), by accessing the URL /class/classLoader?\nWhile this particular chain would not result in a useful response, this doesn’t change that the methods were invoked.\nWe identified a number of URLs that could be abused to access otherwise inaccessible jobs, or even invoke internal methods in the web application server to invalidate all sessions.\nThe security advisory provides an overview of the issues we’d identified by then.\n\nThe Idea\n\nTo solve this problem inherent in the Stapler framework’s design, we defined rules that restrict invocation beyond what would be allowed by Stapler.\nFor example, the declared return type of getters now needed to be one defined in Jenkins core or a Jenkins plugin and have either clearly Stapler-related methods (with Stapler annotations, parameter types, etc.) or Stapler-related resource files associated with it.\nOtherwise, the type wouldn’t be aware of Stapler, and couldn’t produce a meaningful response anyway.\n\nThis meant that getters just declaring Object (or List, Map, etc.) would no longer be allowed by default.\nIt was clear to the developers working on this problem that we needed the ability to be able to override the default rules for specific getters.\nBut allowing plugin developers to adapt their plugins after we published the fix wasn’t going to cut it;\nJenkins needed to ship with a comprehensive default whitelist for methods known to not conform to the new rules, so that updating would not result in problems for users.\n\nThe Solution\n\nWhile there is tooling like Plugin Compatibility Tester and Acceptance Test Harness, many Jenkins plugins do not have comprehensive tests of their UI — the Jenkins UI is fairly stable after all.\nWe did not expect to have sufficient test coverage to deliver a change like this with confidence.\nThe only way we would be able to build such a comprehensive whitelist would be to add telemetry to Jenkins.\n\nWhile Jenkins instances periodically report usage statistics to the Jenkins project, the information included is very bare bones and mostly useful to know the number of installations, the popularity of plugins, and the general size of Jenkins instances through number and types of jobs and agents.\nWe also didn’t want to just collect data without a clear goal, so we set ourselves some limitations — collect as little data as possible, no personally identifiable information, have a specific purpose for each kind of information we would collect, and define an end date for the collection in advance.\nWe defined all of this in JEP-214, created the Uplink service that would receive submissions, and added the basic client framework to Jenkins.\nThe implementation is fairly basic — we just submit an arbitrary JSON object with some added metadata to a service.\nThis system would inform tweaks to a security fix we were anxious to get out, after all.\n\nStarting in mid October for weekly releases, and early November for LTS, tens of thousands of Jenkins instances would submit Stapler request dispatch telemetry daily, and we would keep identifying code incompatible with the new rules and amending the fix.\nUltimately, the whitelist would include a few dozen entries, preventing serious regressions in popular plugins like Credentials Plugin, JUnit Plugin, or the Pipeline plugins suite, down to Google Health Check Plugin, a plugin with just 80 installations when we published the fix.\n\nLearning what requests would result in problems also allowed us to write better developer documentation — we already knew what code patterns would break, and how popular each of them was in the plugin ecosystem.\n\nThe Overhaul\n\nI wrote above:\n\nFor example, the declared return type of getters now needed to be one defined in Jenkins core or a Jenkins plugin and have either clearly Stapler-related methods (with Stapler annotations, parameter types, etc.) or Stapler-related resource files associated with it.\n\nWhile this was true for the fix during most of development, it isn’t how the fix that we published actually works.\nAbout a month before the intended release date, internal design/code review feedback criticized the complicated and time-consuming implementation that at the time required scanning the class path of Jenkins and all plugins and looking for related resources, and suggested a different approach.\n\nSo we tried to require that the declared type or any of its ancestors be annotated with the new annotation @StaplerAccessibleType, annotated a bunch of types in Jenkins itself ( ModelObject being the obvious first choice), and ran our scripts that check to see whether Stapler would be allowed to dispatch methods identified in telemetry.\nWe’d long since automated the daily update of dispatch telemetry processing, so it was a simple matter of changing which Jenkins build we were working with.\n\nAfter a few iterations of adding the annotation to more classes, the results were very positive: Very few additional types needed whitelisting, while many more were no longer (unnecessarily) allowed to be dispatched to.\nThis experiment, late during development, ended up being essentially the fix we delivered.\nWe didn’t need to perform costly scanning of the class path on startup — we didn’t need to scan the class path at all — , and the rules governing request dispatch in Stapler, while different from before, are still pretty easy to understand and independent of how components are packaged.\n\nThe Outcome\n\nAs usual when delivering a fix we expect could result in regressions in plugins, we created a wiki page that users could report problems on.\nRight now, there’s one entry on that wiki page.\nIt is one we were aware of well before release, decided against whitelisting it, and the affected, undocumented feature in Git Plugin ended up being removed.\nThe situation in our issue tracker is only slightly worse, with two apparently minor issues having been reported in Jira.\n\nWithout telemetry, delivering a fix like this one would have been difficult to begin with.\nTinkering with the implementation just a few weeks before release and having any confidence in the result?\nNot causing any significant regressions?\nI think this would simply be impossible.","title":"First successful use of Jenkins

However, I had never been able to engage in an open-source project as a\ncontributor, until now.\n\nSince I made my first—​ridiculously simple—​commit into Jenkins, six months ago (in September, 2018), I have been\nattempting to contribute more to the Jenkins project. However, contributing to open-source projects is, in general,\nchallenging. Especially to long-lived projects, with a lot of history, legacy code and tribal knowledge. It is often\ndifficult to know where to start and also difficult to come up with a plan to keep moving forward and contributing\nregularly, and in more meaningful ways over time.\n\nWhen it comes to the Jenkins project, I have encountered challenges that others trying to get into the community are\nlikely to encounter. For that reason, I have decided to go ahead and share my journey of becoming a more engaged Jenkins\ncontributor.\n\nI plan to publish roughly 1 post per month, describing this journey. I will attempt to start contributing to the pieces\nthat are easier to start with, transitioning towards more complex contributions over time.\n\nWhere to start\n\njenkins.io\n\nTo become a Jenkins contributor, the most obvious place to start looking at is jenkins.io. In the\ntop navbar there is a Community dropdown, with several links to different sections. The first entry,\nOverview, takes us to the “Participate and contribute” section.\n\nIn this section we get lots of information about the many ways in which we can engage with the Jenkins project and\ncommunity. Even though the intention is to display all the possible options, allowing the reader to choose, it can feel\na bit overwhelming.\n\nThe page is divided into two columns, the column on the left shows the different options to participate, while the\ncolumn on the right shows the different options to contribute.\n\nSuggestions to Participate\n\nIn the left column of the “Participate and contribute” page, there are several ideas on how to engage with the community,\nranging from communicating to reviewing changes or providing feedback.\n\nOne of the pieces that got me confused at first in this area were the communication channels. There are many different\nchannels for communication. There are several mailing lists and there are also IRC\nand Gitter channels.\n\nDuring my first attempts to get involved, I subscribed to many of the mailing lists and several IRC and Gitter channels,\nbut I quickly noticed that there is significant communication going on; and that most threads in the most active lists\nand channels are specific to issues users or developers have. So, unless your goal is to support other users right away\n(if you are an experienced Jenkins user already it might be the case) or you plan to ask questions that you already\nhave in mind, I would advise against spending too much time on this at first.\n\nEven though it is great to see how the community members support each other, the amount of communication might be\noverwhelming for a newcomer, and if you are also trying to contribute to the project (either with translations,\ndocumentation or code), following these conversations might not be the best way to start.\n\nSuggestions to Contribute\n\nIn the right column of the “Participate and contribute” page there are several ideas on how to contribute, mostly\ngrouped into: writing code, translating, documenting and testing.\n\nIn following posts, I will be going through all of these types of contributions, as well as through some of the\nsuggestions to participate, which include reviewing Pull Requests (PRs) or providing feedback (either reporting new\nissues or replicating cases other users have already described, providing additional information to help the maintainer\nreproduce and fix them).\n\nMy first contribution in this journey\n\nWhen looking at the “Participate and contribute” page, I noticed a couple of things in that page that I could help\nimprove. And I was actually planning to pick one of those as the first example of a contribution for this post. But\nwhen I was reading the contributing guidelines of the repository, I found an even easier contribution I could make,\nwhich I thought would be a great example to illustrate how simple it could be to start contributing. So I decided to go\nahead with it.\n\nThe website repository\n\nIn the ”Document” section there is a link to the\ncontributing guidelines of the jenkins.io repository.\nThe CONTRIBUTING file is a common file present in the root folder of most open-source-project repositories.\n\nFollowing the link to that file, I reached the jenkins.io repository, which is the one that contains the sources for\nthe corresponding website—​which also includes this blog. And, in fact, the contributing file was the first file I\nwanted to review, in order to learn more about how to contribute to the website.\n\nFound a broken link\n\nWhen reading the contributing file, I learned about the Awestruct static site generator, which is the tool used to\ntransform the AsciiDoc source files in the repo into a website. However, when I clicked the link to learn more about it, I noticed it was broken. The domain had expired.\n\nWhy not fix it?\n\nThis was the opportunity I chose to show other newcomers how easy it can be to start contributing.\n\nForking the repository\n\nThe first step, as usual, would be to fork the repository and clone it to my machine.\n\nApplying the change\n\nThe next step would be to apply the change to the corresponding file. To do so, I created a new branch\n“alternative-awestruct-link” and applied the change there:\n\nMaking sure everything builds correctly and tests pass\n\nEven though in this case my contribution was not to the actual website, but to the contributing guidelines (and for\nthat reason was unlikely to break anything), it is a best practice to get used to the regular process every\ncontribution should follow, making sure everything builds correctly after any change.\n\nAs stated in the contributing guidelines themselves, in order to build this repository we just have to run the default\n“make” target, in the root of the repository.\n\nOnce the command execution finishes, if everything looks good, we are ready to go to the next step: creating the PR.\n\nCreating the PR\n\nOnce my change had been committed and pushed to my repository, I just had to create the PR. We have an easy way to do so\nby just clicking the link that we get in our git logs once the push is completed, although we can create the PR directly\nthrough the GitHub UI, if we prefer so; or even use “hub”, the GitHub CLI, to do it.\n\nIn this case, I just clicked the link, which took me to the PR creation page on GitHub. Once there, I added a\ndescription and created the PR.\n\nWhen a PR to this repository is created, we notice there are some checks that start running. Jenkins repositories are\nconfigured to notify the “Jenkins on Jenkins”, which runs the corresponding CI pipelines for\neach repository, as described in the corresponding Jenkinsfile.\n\nOnce the checks are completed, we can see the result in the PR:\n\nAnd if we want to see the details of the execution, we can follow the “Show all checks” link:\n\nPR Review\n\nNow that the PR has been created and all automated checks are passing, we only have to wait for peer code reviews.\n\nOnce someone approves the PR and it is later merged, your contribution is integrated into the master branch of the\nrepository, becoming part of the next release.\n\nI have contributed!\n\nThis contribution I made is a trivial one, with very little complexity and it might not be the most interesting one if\nyou are trying to contribute code to the Jenkins project itself.\n\nHowever, for me, as the contributor, it was a great way to get familiar with the repository, its contributing\nguidelines, the technology behind the jenkins.io website; and, above anything else, to start “losing the fear” of\ncontributing to an open source project like Jenkins.\n\nSo, if you are in the same position I was, do not hesitate. Go ahead and find your own first contribution.

The CDF believes in the power of Continuous Delivery, and it aims to foster and sustain the ecosystem of open-source, vendor neutral projects.\n\nJenkins contributors have decided that our project should join this new foundation. This discussion happened over a period of time, with a relatively succinct summary of the motivation comes from here.\n\nNow, as a user, what does this mean?\n\nFirst, there will be no big disruption/discontinuity. The same people are still here, no URL is changing, releases will come out like they’ve always been. We will make the decisions the same way as we’ve been making, and pull requests land the same way. Changes will happen continuously over the period of time.\n\nThis is yet another testament to the maturity and the importance of the Jenkins project in this space. With a quarter million Jenkins running around the globe, it’s truly rocking the world of software development from IoT to games, cloud native webapps to machine learning projects. It makes Jenkins such an obvious, safe choice for anyone seeking open heterogeneous DevOps strategy.\n\nThe CDF creates a level playing field that is well-understood to organized contributors, which further, translate into more contributors, hence resulting in a better Jenkins, faster. Over the past years, the Jenkins project has been steadily growing more structures that provide this clarity, and this is the newest step on this trajectory.\n\nAny serious dev teams are combining multiple tools and services to cover the whole software development spectrum. A lot of work gets reinvented in those teams to integrate those tools together. Jenkins will be working more closely with other projects under the umbrella of the CDF, which would result in better aligned software with less overlap.\n\nOur users are practitioners trying to improve the software development process in their organizations. They get that CI/CD/automation which unlocks the productivity that their organizations need, but that’s not always obvious to their organizations as a whole. So our users often struggle to get the necessary support. The CDF will advocate for the practice of Continuous Delivery, and because it’s not coming from a vendor or a project, it will reach the people who can lend that support.\n\nSo I hope you can see why we are so excited about this!\n\nIn fact, for us, this is an idea that we’ve been cooking for close to two years. I don’t think I’m exaggerating much to say the whole idea of the CDF started from the Jenkins project.\n\nA lot of people have done so much work behind the scene to make this happen. But a few people played such instrumental roles that I have to personally thank them namely, Chris Aniszczyk for his patience and persistence, R. Tyler Croy for cooking and evolving the idea, and Tracy Miranda for bringing this idea into a reality.","title":"Jenkins is joining the Continuous Delivery

the Docker image.\nYou can select a Java 11 based image by suffixing the tag of the image with -jdk11.\nIf you are upgrading an existing instance please read the Upgrading Jenkins Java version from 8 to 11 page before upgrading.\n\nSo you can run Jenkins on Java 11 with:\n\ndocker run -p 50000:50000 -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:2.164-jdk11\n\nHowever, and as always, you can still start Jenkins with other methods.\nPlease see the more detailed documentation at Running Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nDeveloper guidelines\n\nFor developers involved in Jenkins development, you can find details on developing and testing Jenkins to run on Java 11 on the Java 11 Developer Guidelines.\n\nThis resource regroups the modifications which might need to be done in order to validate the compatibility of plugins for Java 11.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nEven though this is a big achievement, we still have work to do.\n\nOur first priority is adding Java 11 support to JenkinsFile Runner project.\nFrom there, we will move on to port Java 11 support to the Jenkins X project and the Evergreen project.\n\nSo, even if this is a big deal to us, this is not the end of the story.\nIt is a major step that will benefit users, developers, and members of the Jenkins community.\n\nReference links\n\nRunning Jenkins on Java

behalf of the Jenkins GSoC org team,\nI am happy to announce that the Jenkins project has been accepted to\nGoogle Summer of Code 2019.\nThis year we invite students and mentors to join the Jenkins community and work together\non enhancing the Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nJust to provide some numbers, this is the biggest GSoC ever, 206 organizations will participate in GSoC this year.\nAnd it will be hopefully the biggest year for Jenkins as well.\nWe have 25 project ideas\nand more than 30 potential mentors (and counting!).\nIt is already more than in 2016 and 2018 combined.\nThere are many plugins, SIGs and sub-projects which have already joined GSoC this year.\nAnd we have already received messages and first contributions from dozens of students, yey!\n\nWhat’s next?\nGSoC is officially announced, and please expect more students to contact projects in our\nGitter channels and mailing lists.\nMany communications will also happen in SIG and sub-project channels.\nWe will be working hard in order to help students to find interesting projects, to explore the area,\nand to prepare their project proposals before the deadline on April 9th.\nThen we will process the applications, select projects and assign mentor teams.\n\nAll information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its sub-project page.\n\nI am a student. How do I apply?\n\nSee the Information for students page for full application guidelines.\n\nWe encourage interested students to reach out to the Jenkins community early and to start exploring project ideas.\nAll project ideas have chats and mailing lists referenced on their pages.\nWe will be also organizing office hours for students,\nand you can use these meetings to meet org admins and mentors and to ask questions.\nAlso, join our Gitter channel and the\nmailing list\nto receive information about such incoming events in the project.\n\nThe application period starts on March 25th, but you can prepare now!\nUse the time before the application period to discuss and improve your project proposals.\nWe also recommend that you become familiar with Jenkins and start exploring your proposal areas.\nProject ideas include quick-start guidelines and reference newbie-friendly issues\nwhich may help with initial study.\nIf you do not see anything interesting,\nyou can propose your own project idea\nor check out ideas proposed by other organizations\nparticipating in GSoC.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt’s not!\nWe are looking for more project ideas and for Jenkins contributors/users\nwho are passionate about Jenkins and want to mentor students.\nNo hardcore experience required, mentors can study the project internals together with students and technical advisors.\nWe are especially interested in ideas beyond the Java stack, and in ideas focusing new technologies and areas\n(e.g. Kubernetes, IoT, Python, Go, whatever).\n\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee the Call for Mentors post\nand Information for mentors for details.\nIf you want to propose a new project,\nplease do so by March 11th so that students have time to explore them and to prepare their proposals.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nImportant dates\n\nMar 11 - deadline for new GSoC project idea proposals\n\nApr 09 - deadline for student applications\n\nMay 06 - accepted projects announced, teams start community bonding and coding\n\nAug 26 - coding period ends\n\nSep 03 - Results announced\n\nSee the GSoC Timeline for more info.\nIn the Jenkins project we will also organize special events during and after GSoC (e.g. at Jenkins world).","title":"Jenkins is accepted to Google Summer Of Code 2019!","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2019","events","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/author/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3a32be4f-441e-5dd8-a3ed-bf3e1d6e4048","slug":"/blog/2019/03/01/devops-world-jenkins-world-cfp-open/","strippedHtml":"The DevOps World | Jenkins World shuttle is ready for lift off once again.
