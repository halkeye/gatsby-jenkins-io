see https://jenkins.io/redirect/class-filter/\n\nIf you see this kind of message, we highly recommend reporting it so that it can be investigated and probably fixed quickly.\n\nReporting JEP-200 issues\n\nStarting from May 01, JEP-200 issues are triaged by plugin and core maintainers.\nJEP-200 maintainers are available for code reviews if needed,\nbut they will not be reviewing cases in JIRA and searching for miscategorized issues on a daily basis.\nIf you experience new JEP-200 regressions, please follow the guidelines below.\n\nPlease report any issues you encounter matching the above pattern in the\nJenkins issue tracker, under the appropriate plugin component.\nBefore reporting please check whether this issue has already been reported.\n\nAdd the JEP-200 label\n\nInclude the stacktrace you see in the log\n\nIf possible, include complete steps to reproduce the problem from scratch\n\nYou can find examples of previously reported issues using this query.\n\nJenkins developers will evaluate issues and strive to offer a fix in the form of a core and/or plugin update.\nRight after the feature release there was be a special team triaging the reports.\nStarting from May 01 the issues will be triaged by plugin and core maintainers.\nSee JEP-200 Maintenance plan for more info.\n\nFor more details and current status, see\nPlugins affected by fix for JEP-200.\n\nApplying workarounds\n\nAssuming you see no particular reason to think that the class in question has dangerous deserialization semantics, which is rare,\nit is possible to work around the problem in your own installation as a temporary expedient.\nNote the class name(s) mentioned in the JEP-200 log messages,\nand run Jenkins with the hudson.remoting.ClassFilter startup option, e.g.:\n\njava -Dhudson.remoting.ClassFilter=some.pkg.and.ClassName,some.pkg.and.OtherClassName -jar jenkins.war ...\n\nThis workaround process may require several iterations, because classes whitelisted in the workaround may also\ninclude fields with types requiring whitelisting.\n\nFor plugin developers\n\nIf you are a plugin developer, please see the original JEP-200 announcement.\nThat blog post provides guidelines for testing and fixing plugin compatibility after the JEP-200 changes.\nThe presentation above also provides some information about what needs to be tested.","title":"Security hardening: Jenkins LTS 2.107.1 switches XStream / Remoting blacklists to whitelists (JEP-200)","tags":["core","security","remoting","upgrade"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b9886e8d-a501-5b7a-8e2a-2ba26132ecae","slug":"/blog/2018/03/12/browser-usage/","strippedHtml":"Over the last year, several efforts were done on jenkins.io like\nsecurity advisories or documentation\nand I wanted to understand the impact it had on its traffic.\n\nI had a look to the Google Analytics account used for jenkins.io and it was\ninteresting to discover which browsers are used by Jenkins visitors and how\nthis compares with other websites. So I decided to analyze one year of data\nfrom January 2017 to January 2018. Then I selected\nstatcounter\nas an external data source in order to compare results from jenkins.io.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about numbers:\n\nDuring that period, 3,496,245 users across the world visited this website.\n\nThis is a growth of 52.69% visitors compared to the year before.\n\n92.28% of them used a desktop, 6.63% were on mobile and only 1.10% on a tablet.\n\nTable 1. Browser Usage\n\nBrowser\nPercentage\n\nChrome\n69.82%\n\nFirefox\n14.75%\n\nSafari\n6.44%\n\nIE\n5.84%\n\nEdge\n1.59%\n\nWe clearly see that 91% of Jenkins.io visitors only use three browsers. Chrome\nis by far the leader followed by Firefox and Safari.\n\nObviously those numbers taken alone don’t mean anything, so let’s try to put\nthem in perspective with another data source.\n\nNetscape 4.8 was still used by 15 visitors over the year.\n\n6 visitors used their Nintendo DS.\n\nStatCounter\n\nLet’s now compare our previous results with the same time period from\nstatcounter who argues to collect data from\n2million websites.  Statcounter allow us to display browsers stats based on 4\ndifferent categories, 'All platform', 'Desktop', 'Tablet' or 'Mobile'. + For\nthis comparison, I am interested by 'All platform' and of course 'Desktop' as\n92.28% of Jenkins.io visitors use a desktop.\n\nTable 2. Browser Market Share Across All Platforms\n\nBrowser\nPercentage\n\nChrome\n54.13%\n\nSafari\n14.50%\n\nUC Browser\n8.25%\n\nFirefox\n6.15%\n\nIE\n3.89%\n\nExcepted Chrome who still leads the ranking with \"only\" 54%, all the others\nactors are totally shuffled.  Safari moved to the 2nd place with 14.50% 'UC\nBrowser' appeared in the top 3 with 8.25% where only 0.10% of Jenkins.io\nvisitors were using UC browser.  Firefox moved to the 4th places with only\n6.15%.  It’s interesting how this \"All platform\" browser market share from\nstatcounter doesn’t reflect Jenkins.io visitors' habits.\n( Source )\n\nNow at a first glance, results look more similar to the Jenkins.io visitors;\nexcepted for Chrome and Firefox which shed some percentages in favor of\nInternet Explorer and Edge.  This promotes IE to the 3rd place with 8.86% of\nusage, and downgrade Safari to the 4th place with 6,44%.  Compared to\nJenkins.io results, Edge is still at the 5th position.  It’s very interesting\nto see how this ranking is so different from the \"All platform\" one but follows\nthe same pattern coming from Jenkins.io visitors.  This highlights how browser\nchoices are strongly influenced by the platform used and contrary to a general\ntrend,\nJenkins.io visitors remain desktop users.  This absence of mobile users\nprobably explains why some browsers are so under represented within Jenkins\nvisitors.\n( Source )\n\nTable 3.

Globally, you can choose a global default durability setting:\n2. Each Pipeline can get a custom Durability Setting:\n3. Multibranch Projects can use a new BranchProperty to customize the Durability Setting.\n\nWill Performance-Optimized Mode Help Me?\nOther Goodies\nHow Did You Do It?\nWhat Next?\n\nSince it launched, Pipeline has had a bit of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde performance problem.  In certain circumstances, Pipeline can turn from a mild-mannered CI/CD assistant into a monster.  It will happily eat storage read/write capacity like popcorn without caring about the other concerns of our friendly butler.  When combined with other additional factors, this can result in real-world stability problems.  For example, combining slow storage with a spike in running Pipelines has brought down production Jenkins at more than one organization.  Similarly, users see issues if a busy controller gets hit with an extra source of stress; past culprits have been heavy automated (ab)use of Jenkins APIs, now-solved user lookup bugs, backup jobs, and plugins run crazy that load excessive numbers of builds.  Symptoms ranged from visible slowdowns in the UI to unresponsive jobs and \"hung\" controllers.\n\nNow I’m not saying this to scare people or to criticize the technology we’ve built. Implementing Pipeline scalability best practices coupled with SSD storage keeps Jenkins in a happy place.  We just need context on the weaknesses to see why it’s important to address them.\n\nIntroducing \"Project Cheetah\"\n\nToday we’re announcing the first major results of \"Project Cheetah\", our long-running effort to address these challenges and improve Pipeline scalability.  More broadly, Cheetah aims to help in 3 places:\n\nSmall-scale containers: Pipeline needs to run leanly in resource-constrained containers, to enable easy scale-out without consuming excessive resources on shared container hosts.\n\nEnterprise systems: Pipeline needs to effectively serve high-scale Jenkins instances that are central to many large companies.\n\nGeneral case: run Pipelines a bit more quickly on average, and allow users to get much-stronger performance in worst-case scenarios.\n\nThese changes are implemented across many of the Pipeline plugins.\n\nYes, but what does it DO?\n\nProject Cheetah offers several things, but the most important is Durability Settings for all Pipelines, and especially the Performance-Optimized setting.  This setting avoids several potentially unexpected performance \"surprises\" that may strike users.  In the general case, it greatly reduces the disk IO needs for Pipeline.  How much?  Below is a graph of storage utilization with legacy Pipeline versions (think early 2017) and with the latest version using the Performance-Optimized mode.  These are tested on an AWS instance backed by an EBS volume provisioned with 300 IOPs.\n\nBefore and After:\n\nAs you can see, storage utilization goes down by a lot.  While the exact number will vary, across the benchmark testcases this results in Pipeline throughput of 2x to 6x the previous before becoming IO-bound. This also increases stability of Jenkins controllers because they will tolerate unexpected load.\n\nThis comes with a major drop in CPU IOWait as well:\n\nAnd of course the rate at which data is written to disk and number of writes/s is also reduced:\n\nFor enterprise users, timing stats often show 10-20% of normal builds is serializing the Program and writing the record of steps run (\"FlowNodes\") - the performance optimized durability setting will cut this to almost nothing (for standard pipelines, 1/100 or less) - so builds will complete faster, especially complex ones.\n\nPlease see the Pipeline Scalability documentation for deeper information on the new Durability Settings, how to use them, and which plugin versions are required to gain these features.\n\nAlso, users may see a reduction in hung Pipelines because new test utilities made it possible to identify and correct a variety of bugs.\n\nHow Do I Set Speed/Durability Settings?\n\nThere are 3 ways to configure the durability setting:\n\n1. Globally, you can choose a global default durability setting:\n\nUnder \"Manage Jenkins\" > \"Configure System\", labelled \"Pipeline Speed/Durability Settings\".  You can override these with the more specific settings below.\n\n2. Each Pipeline can get a custom Durability Setting:\n\nThis is one of the job properties located at the top of the job configuration, labelled \"Custom Pipeline Speed/Durability Level.\" This overrides the global setting. Or, use a \"properties\" step - the setting will apply to the NEXT run after the step is executed (same result).\n\n// Script //\nproperties([durabilityHint('PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED')])\n// Declarative //\npipeline {\n    agent any\n    stages {\n        stage('Example') {\n            steps {\n                echo 'Hello World'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    options {\n        durabilityHint('PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED')\n    }\n}\n\n3. Multibranch Projects can use a new BranchProperty to customize the Durability Setting.\n\nUnder the SCM you can configure a custom Branch Property Strategy and add a property for Custom Pipeline Speed/Durability Level.  This overrides the global Durability Setting and will apply to each branch at the next run.  You can also use a \"properties\" step to override the setting, but remember that you may have to run the step again to undo this.\n\nDurability settings will take effect with the next applicable Pipeline run, not immediately.  The setting will be displayed in the log.\n\nThere is a slight durability trade-off for using the Performance-Optimized mode — the appropriate section of the Pipeline Scalability documentation has the specifics.\nFor most uses we do not expect this to be important, but there are a few specific cases where users may wish to use a slower/higher-durability setting. The Best Practices are documented.\n\nWe recommend using Performance-Optimized by default, but because it does represent a slight behavioral change the initial \"Cheetah\" plugin releases defaults to maintain previous behavior. We expect to switch this default in the future with appropriate notice once people have a chance to get used to the new settings.\n\nWill Performance-Optimized Mode Help Me?\n\nYes, if your Jenkins instance uses NFS, magnetic storage, runs many Pipelines at once, or shows high iowait (above 5%)\n\nYes, if you are running Pipelines with many steps (more than several hundred).\n\nYes, if your Pipeline stores large files or complex data to variables in the script, keeps that variable in scope for future use, and then runs steps.  This sounds oddly specific but happens more than you’d expect.\n\nFor example: readFile step with a large XML/JSON file, or using configuration information from parsing such a file with One of the Utility Steps.\n\nAnother common pattern is a \"summary\" object containing data from many branches (logs, results, or statistics). Often this is visible because you’ll be adding to it often via an add/append or Map.put() operations.\n\nLarge arrays of data or Maps of configuration information are another common example of this situation.\n\nNo, if your Pipelines spend almost all their time waiting for a few shell/batch steps to finish.  This ISN’T a magic \"go fast\" button for everything!\n\nNo, if Pipelines are writing massive amounts of data to logs (logging is unchanged).\n\nNo, if you are not using Pipelines, or your system is loaded down by other factors.\n\nNo, if you don’t enable higher-performance modes for pipelines.  See above for how!\n\nOther Goodies\n\nUsers can now set an optional job property so that individual Pipelines fail cleanly rather than resuming upon restarting the controller.  This is useful for niche cases where some Pipelines are considered disposable and users would value a clean restart over Pipeline durability.\n\nWe’ve reduced classloading and reflection quite significantly, which improves scaling and reduces CPU use:\n\nScript Security (as of version 1.41) has gotten optimizations to reduce the performance overhead of Sandbox mode and eliminate lock contention so Pipeline multithreads better.\n\nPipeline Step data uses up less space on disk (regardless of the durability setting) - this should be 30% smaller.  Assume it’s a few MB per 1000 steps - but for every build after the change.\n\nEven in the low-performance/high-durability modes, some redundant writes have been removed, which decreases the number of writes by 10-20%.\n\nHow Did You Do It?\n\nThat’s probably material for another blog post or Jenkins World talk.\n\nThe short answer is: first we built a tool to simulate a full production environment and provide detailed metrics collection at scale.  Then we profiled Jenkins to identify bottlenecks and attacked them.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nWhat Next?\n\nThe next big change, which I’m calling Cheetah Part 2 is to address Pipeline’s logging. For every Step run, Pipeline writes one or more small log files. These log files are then copied into the build log content, but are retained to make it possible to easily fetch logs for each step.\n\nThis copying process means every log line is written twice, greatly reducing performance, and writing to many small files is orders of magnitude slower than appending to one big log file.\n\nWe’re going to remove this duplication and data fragmentation and use a more efficient mechanism to find per-step logs. This should further improve the ability to run Pipelines on NFS mounts and hard-drive-backed storage, and should significantly improve performance at scale.\n\nBesides this, there’s a variety of different tactical improvements to improve scaling behavior and reduce resource needs.\n\nThe Project Cheetah work doesn’t free users to completely ignore Pipeline scaling best practices and previous suggestions.  Nor does it eliminate the need for efficient GC settings.  But this and other enhancements from the last year can significantly improve the storage situation for most users and reduce the penalties for worst-case behaviors.  When you add all the pieces together, the result is a faster, leaner, more reliable Pipeline experience.","title":"Project Cheetah - Faster, Leaner Pipeline That Can Keep Up With Demand","tags":["pipeline","performance","scalability"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"svanoort","html":"","id":"svanoort","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sam Van Oort","slug":"/blog/authors/svanoort","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d1b0a235-d051-5787-9aab-f43b8d0a68ca","slug":"/blog/2018/02/19/gsoc2018-announcement/","strippedHtml":"We are happy to announce that Jenkins project has been accepted to\nGoogle Summer of Code 2018.\nThis year we invite students and mentors to join the Jenkins community and work together\non various initiatives: core, plugins, development tools and infrastructure.\n\nOur mentors have already created some project ideas.\nFor example, you are welcome to work on the new Configuration-as-Code initiative or\nto help creating standard API for Code Coverage plugins.\nIf you like test automation, there is a proposal to\nJenkins Acceptance Test Harness.\nOver the next weeks we plan to extend this list by new even more project ideas.\n\nAll information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its subproject page.\n\nI am a student. How do I apply?\n\nSee Information for students for application guidelines.\n\nFirst step is to join discussions in the mailing lists in order to introduce yourself, establish connections with the community and potential mentors.\nThe application period starts on March 12 and ends on March 27, but don’t let it misguide you!\nUse time before application to discuss project ideas/proposals with mentors and to process their feedback.\nTo create a better proposal, we also recommend to study Jenkins and to do some contributions in the area of your project proposal.\n\nNot satisfied by the current project ideas?\nYou can propose your own idea\nin the developer mailing list.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt’s not!\nIf you are passionate about open-source and Jenkins, we invite you to join the mentors team.\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee Call for Mentors and Information for mentors for details.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nImportant dates\n\nMar 05 - deadline for new GSoC project idea proposals\n\nMar 12 - student application period starts\n\nMar 27 - deadline for student applications\n\nApr 23 - accepted projects announced, community bonding starts\n\nMay 14 - coding period starts\n\nAug 06 - end of the coding period\n\nSee the GSoC Timeline for more info.\nIn the Jenkins project we will also organize special events during and after GSoC (e.g. at Jenkins world).\n\nP.S: I am going to create a special GSoC 2018 edition of swags for mentors and students.

Jenkins.\nFolks of all experience levels are welcome;\nthere will be sessions for everyone from seasoned hackers to new contributors.\n\nAll-day Jenkins Hackfest\n\nThe Hackfest will start at 9:30am on Monday with general introductions and gathering of potential topics/projects.\nBring suggestions for topics that interest you, or just come and choose from the topics others suggest.\nThere will be plenty of topics from which to choose.\nAll the topic suggestions will all be added to a backlog and we will identify and cluster around popular topics.\nThen we’ll divide into smaller groups and work on individual topics in timeboxed sessions.\n\nMeals, snacks, and beverages will be provided throughout the day, wrapping up with dinner around 5pm.\n\nSomething for everyone\n\nHackfests like this one are a great opportunity for contributors of all levels to get invovled, learn from each other, and\nwork together on interesting and high impact areas of the project.\n\nSome long-time contributors already know what areas they’ll work on and are looking for people interested in joining them.\nMark Waite (maintainer of the Jenkins Git and Git Client plugins) and Christian Halstrick (SAP) will be spending the day improving the way Git client plugin uses JGit.\nR.
