After a sizable amount of preparation, this week’s release of\nJenkins 2.54 is the first weekly release to require\na Java 8 runtime.\n\nFor users of the weekly release, this means that Jenkins 2.54 must have\na Java 8 runtime installed on the system in order to\nrun. Those using the\njenkinsci/jenkins:latest\nDocker container won’t need to take any action, as the Java runtime environment\nis already bundled in the container.\n\nIn addition to upgrading the Java Runtime Environment for the controller, any\nconnected agents must upgrade to a Java 8 runtime environment.\n\nThe Long-Term Support (LTS) release line however, has\nnot yet been updated to require Java 8. We are expecting the first LTS release\nto require Java 8 in June.\n\nCompatibility Notes\n\nUsing the Maven project type with Java 7\n\nUsers with jobs configured with the \"Maven project\" type may not be able to use\nJava 7 for their Maven jobs. The correct behavior is not guaranteed so\nproceed at your own risk. The Maven Project uses Jenkins Remoting to establish\n\"interceptors\" within the Maven executable. Because of this, Maven uses\nRemoting and other Jenkins core classes, and this behavior may break an update.\n\nSee also:\nJENKINS-40990.\n\nJava 9 compatibility\n\nAt this point, Jenkins does not yet support Java 9 development releases.\n\nAs always, if you have questions please ask on the\njenkinsci-users@ mailing list or\nreport\nan issue in JIRA.\n\nReferences\n\nJVM statistics post back in November 2016.\n\nOfficial announcement blog post.\n\nOriginal JIRA ticket for this upgrade.\n\nThe 6 months, 82 messages, thread on the Jenkins developers mailing list\n\nThe announcement on the Jenkins users mailing list\n\nThe Pull request on Jenkins core","title":"Starting with 2.54, Jenkins now requires Java 8","tags":["java8"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8e8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/ede19/batmat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/bc20c/batmat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/b691b/batmat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/8ba60/batmat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/a9ea7/batmat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/51559/batmat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/28f98/batmat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":130}}},"blog":"http://batmat.net","github":"batmat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Baptiste has been using and contributing to Jenkins since it was called differently, and is a huge proponent of the Agile, Devops &amp; Continuous Delivery movements.\nHe loves to discuss not only the technical aspects, but also the even more essential cultural aspects of this all, working together to improve the value provided to customers in a great inclusive and blameless environment.</p>\n</div>","id":"batmat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Baptiste Mathus","slug":"/blog/authors/batmat","twitter":"bmathus"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","id":"2ff77860-9123-5dcf-b79a-b4d987a5169e","slug":"/blog/2017/04/10/security-advisory/","strippedHtml":"These are not security fixes you can apply blindly. We strongly recommend you read this post, as well as the security advisory to understand what the vulnerabilities are, whether and how they affect you, and what to expect when upgrading plugins.\n\nMultiple Jenkins plugins received updates today that fix several security vulnerabilities or other security-related issues:\n\nEmail Extension (Email-ext)\n\nEnvironment Injector (EnvInject)\n\nExtensible Choice Parameter\n\nGroovy\n\nJob DSL\n\nLockable Resources\n\nMatrix Authorization\n\nRole Strategy\n\nWarnings\n\nWe also included some plugins that received security fixes in the past that haven’t been mentioned in a security advisory before:\n\nActive Choices (uno-choice)\n\nExtended Choice Parameter\n\nGroovy Postbuild\n\nGroovy Label Assignment\n\nAdditionally, we included other plugins in the advisory that are not getting updated today, but whose vulnerabilities are similar to those of plugins getting fixed.\nIn total, over 30 plugins are part of the advisory.\n\nWhile there are fixes for other vulnerabilities as well, the majority of the advisory (and the rest of this blog post) is about arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins.\n\nBackground\n\nJenkins administrators have long been able to use the Groovy script console and related functionality to execute arbitrary code in Jenkins for diagnostic or otherwise administrative purposes.\nRather than having to rely on plugins implementing the desired functionality, experienced Jenkins admins were able to run a number of scripts as needed to implement various administrative features.\n\nThis bled over into plugins:\nIt’s just easy for a plugin developer to build on top of Groovy and let the users figure out exactly what they want to do.\nUnfortunately, for a long time, there was no technology in Jenkins to limit what could be done in Groovy scripts, so anywhere Groovy would be executed, arbitrary code could be executed.\n\nWe were treating this as a security issue for the first time in the fix for SECURITY-125, about two years ago, something that first required splitting off the Matrix Project type from core into a plugin, and making use of Script Security Plugin.\n\nUnfortunately, other plugins weren’t integrating with Script Security plugin.\nAnd even diligent administrators who understand the problem of arbitrary code execution via Groovy scripts may not be able to tell whether a given plugin is affected:\nIn some cases, you’d need to dive into the source code to see whether, and how, it uses Groovy in a way that can be exploited by regular users to perform actions they otherwise wouldn’t be allowed to do.\n\nAbout the advisory\n\nBroadly speaking, there are three levels of severity for scripting related vulnerabilities in Jenkins:\n\nThe lowest severity ones are those that confuse Overall/Administer and Overall/Run Scripts permissions.\nThese are irrelevant for most Jenkins instances.\nMore on that later.\n\nThe next level up are vulnerabilities that effectively grant the ability to run arbitrary scripts to users who are able to configure jobs.\nWhile these users aren’t administrators, they have a nontrivial level of permissions, so are somewhat trusted.\nThis is often a difficult configuration to adequately secure, but it’s a supported configuration, and any plugin that undermines the security of this configuration will be treated as having a vulnerability.\n\nThe most severe ones are those that require little or no access to Jenkins to successfully exploit.\nThis typically does require the Overall/Read permission to access certain endpoints, but Pipeline as Code may allow people with SCM commit access to exploit scripting related weaknesses as well.\n\nArbitrary code execution is a serious enough issue that publishing a security advisory for just a few plugins would actually be detrimental to overall security:\nMalicious users would be able to review the fixes we do publish, and try to find other plugins affected by a similar vulnerability.\n\nThe advisory issued today lists all plugins we could find that implement any arbitrary code execution vulnerability (i.e. all three levels described above).\nAs this affects over 30 plugins, many of them not actively maintained, the problem exceeds the capacity of the Jenkins security team to address them all.\n\nFor that reason, the Jenkins security team decided that we would fix as many of the plugins as we can handle, and leaving the others to their maintainers.\n\nHow to proceed\n\nWe strongly advise administrators to review the list of affected plugins in the advisory, and look for any plugins that are installed on their instances.\nIt is very likely there’s at least one plugin installed that is affected by this.\nIf you’re on Jenkins 2.40 or newer, or Jenkins LTS 2.32.2 or newer, a warning will appear that informs you about vulnerable plugins you currently have installed.\n\nOnce you’ve determined which plugins you use are included in the advisory, you need to determine whether it is something that affects your particular setup.\n\nIf the vulnerability confuses Overall/Administer and Overall/Run Scripts, but all administrators of your Jenkins instance are able to run scripts anyway, this vulnerability is not a problem for you.\nThis is the case in the vast majority of Jenkins instances.\nOnly custom setups, typically to allow for hosted Jenkins services, don’t grant Overall/Run Scripts permission to administrators.\n\nIf the vulnerability allows users with the permission to e.g. configure jobs to execute arbitrary code, it is only a problem if there are users that have the lower permission (e.g. Item/Configure) but not the higher ( Overall/Run Scripts).\nSimple authorization strategies like Logged in users can do anything are therefore not affected by this issue.\n\nEven vulnerabilities that require no notable permissions in Jenkins may have prerequisites to be exploitable.\nFor example, Overall/Read access may be required, but only granted to users who are also administrators, or in Pipeline as Code setups, everyone with SCM commit access may also be a Jenkins administrator.\n\nThe above should guide your decision how urgently you should upgrade affected plugins with a fix, or disable affected plugins without a fix.\nRemember that you may decide in the future to reconfigure Jenkins in a way that makes previously irrelevant permission distinctions a huge problem, so it is not a good idea to continue using vulnerable plugin versions indefinitely.\n\nAfter deciding to upgrade a plugin, review the advisory and the plugin documentation for information about the migration.\nThe scripts provided in this GitHub repository may help you in determining whether you’re using affected features.\nIf you’re not using any of the affected features, it’s likely that there won’t be any problems and you can just upgrade.\nIf you are using affected features, you should carefully read the documentation on how the upgrade works: Affected plugin features may effectively be disabled until an administrator approves the scripts in use, potentially resulting in build failures.\n\nDistributing vulnerable plugins\n\nFinally, there’s the issue of distribution:\nThe Jenkins project historically has performed little to no oversight over the plugins that are being published.\nThis is a direct consequence of the governance document, which gives plugin maintainers a lot of control over their plugins.\n\nThat said, in exceptional circumstances, the Jenkins project can, and should, protect its users:\nIf a plugin maintainer were to upload a clearly malicious plugin, we wouldn’t stand by the side and continue distributing it.\nIn the case of plugins with known (unintended) vulnerabilities, this obviously becomes more difficult.\nThis has been discussed in the abstract a while back on the jenkinsci-dev mailing list, and the majority of participants in that discussion agreed that we should suspend distribution of vulnerable plugins if the security team doesn’t have the capacity to address the problem, and the vulnerability would remain unfixed otherwise.\n\nWe decided to temporarily suspend distribution of plugins via the Jenkins project update sites if they allow users with lower privileges (no Overall/Administer) to execute arbitrary code.\nUsers who really need to download these plugins can do so via our Artifactory Maven repository.\nOnce an affected plugin receives a fix, we’d of course resume distribution via the update sites.\n\nPlugins that mistake Overall/Administer and Overall/Run Scripts continue being distributed, albeit with a warning shown to Jenkins administrators, as the setup required for this to make a difference is pretty rare.\n\nUnfortunately, we were unable to adequately inform all plugin maintainers before publication of the advisory, so there are several plugins with fewer than 500 installations that are actively maintained but whose maintainers we didn’t contact prior to this advisory.\nFor that, I am really sorry, and can only ask for understanding from the maintainers of affected plugins.\nThe number of affected plugins and the coordination and review required simply exceeded our capabilities.\n\nSubscribe to the jenkinsci-advisories mailing

Other data\nremained consistent with findings year-to-year, for example, the number of\nJenkins users continues to increase and 90% of survey respondents still\nconsider Jenkins mission-critical.\n\nGet the survey infographic PDF\n\nGet the complete survey results in PDF\n\nHere are some of the key findings:\n\n85% of respondants indicated that Jenkins usage had increased\n\n30% of organizations with more than 50 software projects used Jenkins in 2016 as compared to 16% in 2015\n\nAn impressive 46% of respondents were running Jenkins 2.x, eight months after\nits release.\n\nAdoption of Jenkins Pipeline for continuous delivery\n(CD) is accelerating, 54% of respondents who have adopted CD are using Pipeline.\n\n61% of respondents are deploying changes to production at least once per week\n\nLinux is the platform of choice for builds, favored by 85% of respondents\n\n85% of respondants use Git as the source code repository\n\nHalf of respondents are deploying applications directly to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services as the favored platform\n\nWe want to thank everyone for completing the survey, and congratulations to\nIker Garcia for winning a free pass to\nJenkins World 2017 and to\nDave Leifer for winning the Amazon gift card.\n\nWe’re looking forward to creating a 2017 Community Survey later this year and\nhearing more from users at Jenkins World 2017 in San Francisco, we hope to\nsee you there!","title":"The State of Jenkins - 2016 Community Survey","tags":["community","survey","continuous delivery"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"https://www.cloudbees.com/blogs/bhavani-rao","github":null,"html":"","id":"brao","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Bhavani Rao","slug":"/blog/authors/brao","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"5bf5cbad-49a8-533f-b9db-60dff41a2193","slug":"/blog/2017/03/21/toulousejam-pipeline-workshop/","strippedHtml":"Earlier this month, a full-day event about Jenkins Pipeline was organized in Toulouse, France with the Toulouse JAM.\n\nAfter a warm-up on the previous Tuesday where Michaël Pailloncy had given a talk at the local Toulouse Devops user group about Jenkins Pipeline ecosystem, we were ready for more digging :-).\n\nThe agenda\n\nWe had planned the day in two parts:\n\nMorning would be a more driven workshop with slides & exercises to be completed\n\nPizzas & beverages to split the day :-)\n\nAfternoon would be somehow like an Unconference, where people basically decide by themselves what they want to work on.\n\nWe planned to have 30 attendees. We ended up having 25.\nWe considered having more people, but finally decided that for a first time it would be better to start not too big.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nInfrastructure was sponsored by DigitalOcean.\n\nFor each attendee, we provisioned :\n\nOne Controller, preconfigured to be able to dynamically provision agents.\n\nOne staging environment\n\nOne production environment\n[ 1 ]\n\nOne SonarQube instance\n\nWorkshop content & infrastructure\n\nAfter an initial quick presentation to settle context and remind some general things about Continuous Delivery and Jenkins, we started the workshop per se.\n\nIt is composed of 3 parts, which are readable here [ 2 ], but very few people were able to start the part 3.\n\nHackergarten / Unconference\n\nSo we let people decide what they wanted to work on during the afternoon.\n\nWe decided to use post-its: each attendee would write down what they wanted to work on, one idea per post-it (max 2 per person).\nThen, we dropped those onto a white-board and tried grouping those by theme.\n\nIn the end, overall, the following themes went out:\n\nHack on Jenkins development & Contribute to Jenkins\n\nComplete the workshops\n\nWork on use-case oriented things\n\nWork on Docker & Pipeline join usages\n\nHackergarten\n\nMany Jenkins accounts were created, and many JIRA and pull requests were filed.\nIt was nice to see people asking questions like: \"so, should I create a JIRA issue for this?\" or \"how do I interact with people\".\nPretty generic \"how do I work on open source software\" questions sometimes, but important because you felt like people were genuinely interested and needed not much to start contributing.\n\nHere are the pull requests filed during this afternoon:\n\nblueocean-pipeline-editor-plugin#30\n\njenkins#2785\n\njenkins#2786\n\njenkins#2787\n\njenkins#2788\n\nYou can see that though most of the PRs were typo-related, the one that got merged first was the one about code :-).\n\nSo, Jeremie Violas wins the Bobble Head as promised!\n\nWhy so many typo-related PRs?\n\nSimply because people were somehow encouraged to find some to get used to the\nround trip of: fixing an issue and filing the associated pull request, rinse &\nrepeat.\n\nI do think this is also a pretty nice and simple first step to understand how\nto build Jenkins and start interacting with the community.\n\nThe result\n\nPeople seemed pretty happy and we got some nice comments like \"now I have a clearer vision of what this Pipeline thing is about\".\nSome attendees also dropped nice comments on the meetup page.\nSo it’s cool because when you’re doing such things on your free time, it’s the main reward you can get.\n\nIf you’re an attendee to such events, don’t forget to thank people organizing\nthose, and more importantly to provide constructive feedback.  We are generally\neager to know what could be done better for next time.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall we are very happy with the energy of that day, and we definitely plan to set up a new session in the next few months, probably with a bit more people.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\nInfrastructure: when you plan to have many VM per attendee, double-check the limits your Cloud Provider may have by default. I had bumped it to 250 the day before the workshop, and asked for another one to 500 during the workshop (though in the end, 250 was probably enough, but this’ll give room for the next time with more people :-)).\n\nLogistics: warning, secret ahead: this is very time consuming.\nNot necessarily the amount of work itself, more that it implies very big latency.\nFor instance, give it 2 to 3 weeks minimum to have answers about sponsoring in general. Pinging again in case of no answer after 2 days would probably be seen as rude, and possibly lead to make things worse for obvious reasons, so plan ahead.\n\nThank you\n\nDigitalOcean for sponsoring the Infrastructure\n\nWe got way more than 100 VMs running at the same time during the day thanks to their help!\n\nHarryCow Coworking for hosting the event\n\nTo CloudBees for sponsoring the food for all the participants\n\nAlso for providing a bunch of goodies: stickers and T-Shirts for everybody\n\nGitHub for providing stickers\n\n1. For the sake of the simplicity of the workshop, those environments were actually a single VM: the goal was here to illustrate what we could do using Jenkins Pipeline, discussing scalability or more involved deployment techniques was obviously out of scope.\n\n2. in French only for now, but translating it into English to make it possibly shared and reusable among JAMs is being discussed","title":"Pipeline Workshop & Hackergarten @ ToulouseJAM Feedback","tags":["hackergarten","jam","meetup","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8e8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/ede19/batmat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/bc20c/batmat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/b691b/batmat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/8ba60/batmat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/a9ea7/batmat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/51559/batmat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/28f98/batmat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":130}}},"blog":"http://batmat.net","github":"batmat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Baptiste has been using and contributing to Jenkins since it was called differently, and is a huge proponent of the Agile, Devops &amp; Continuous Delivery movements.\nHe loves to discuss not only the technical aspects, but also the even more essential cultural aspects of this all, working together to improve the value provided to customers in a great inclusive and blameless environment.</p>\n</div>","id":"batmat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Baptiste Mathus","slug":"/blog/authors/batmat","twitter":"bmathus"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"6fbbc66f-434f-5721-89f0-d9f144eac41e","slug":"/blog/2017/03/20/security-updates/","strippedHtml":"Multiple Jenkins plugins received updates today that fix several security vulnerabilities:\n\nActive Directory\n\nDistributed Fork\n\nEmail Extension (Email-ext)\n\nMailer\n\nSSH Build Agents\n\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\n\nAdditionally, we also published a security notice for the following plugin and recommend that users disable and uninstall it:\n\nPipeline: Classpath Step\n\nThis plugin is not part of the Pipeline suite of plugins, despite its name.
