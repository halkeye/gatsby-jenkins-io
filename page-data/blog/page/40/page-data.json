You now have a working Blue Ocean installation.\nTake a look around at your Pipelines and activity, or try creating a new Pipeline.\nI think you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how intuitive and helpful Blue Ocean can be.\nBlue Ocean is so cool, I never want to leave it.\nOver the next few days, I’ll be publishing a series of videos,\nshowing some common Jenkins use cases and how Blue Ocean makes them clearer and easier than ever before.\n\nStay Tuned!","title":"Getting Started with Blue Ocean","tags":["blueocean","ux","pipeline","tutorial"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"bitwiseman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Liam started his software career as a tester, which might explain why he&#8217;s such a fan of CI/CD and Pipeline as Code.\nHe has spent the majority of his software engineering career implementing Continuous Integration systems at companies big and small.\nHe is a Jenkins project contributor and an expert in Jenkins Pipeline, both Scripted and Declarative.\nLiam currently works as a Jenkins Evangelist at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>.\nWhen not at work, he enjoys testing gravity by doing Aikido.</p>\n</div>","id":"lnewman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Liam Newman","slug":"/blog/author/lnewman","twitter":"bitwiseman"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"cd9ac93a-3ea0-5543-8c2e-1e647b9eb8a1","slug":"/blog/2017/03/24/jenkins-community-survey/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Bhavani Rao, Marketing Manager at CloudBees\n\nLast fall, prior to Jenkins World, CloudBees conducted a\nCommunity Survey.\nWe received over 1200 responses, and thanks to this input, we have some\ninteresting insights into how Jenkins users and their use of Jenkins are\nevolving.\n\nBased on the survey’s results, Jenkins is increasingly being used to support\ncontinuous delivery (CD). Adoption of Jenkins 2, which featured \"Pipeline as code\" and\nencouraged users to adopt Jenkins Pipeline, has\nskyrocketed to more than half of all Jenkins installations.  Other data\nremained consistent with findings year-to-year, for example, the number of\nJenkins users continues to increase and 90% of survey respondents still\nconsider Jenkins mission-critical.\n\nGet the survey infographic PDF\n\nGet the complete survey results in PDF\n\nHere are some of the key findings:\n\n85% of respondants indicated that Jenkins usage had increased\n\n30% of organizations with more than 50 software projects used Jenkins in 2016 as compared to 16% in 2015\n\nAn impressive 46% of respondents were running Jenkins 2.x, eight months after\nits release.\n\nAdoption of Jenkins Pipeline for continuous delivery\n(CD) is accelerating, 54% of respondents who have adopted CD are using Pipeline.\n\n61% of respondents are deploying changes to production at least once per week\n\nLinux is the platform of choice for builds, favored by 85% of respondents\n\n85% of respondants use Git as the source code repository\n\nHalf of respondents are deploying applications directly to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services as the favored platform\n\nWe want to thank everyone for completing the survey, and congratulations to\nIker Garcia for winning a free pass to\nJenkins World 2017 and to\nDave Leifer for winning the Amazon gift card.\n\nWe’re looking forward to creating a 2017 Community Survey later this year and\nhearing more from users at Jenkins World 2017 in San Francisco, we hope to\nsee you there!","title":"The State of Jenkins - 2016 Community Survey","tags":["community","survey","continuous delivery"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"https://www.cloudbees.com/blogs/bhavani-rao","github":null,"html":"","id":"brao","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Bhavani Rao","slug":"/blog/author/brao","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"5bf5cbad-49a8-533f-b9db-60dff41a2193","slug":"/blog/2017/03/21/toulousejam-pipeline-workshop/","strippedHtml":"Earlier this month, a full-day event about Jenkins Pipeline was organized in Toulouse, France with the Toulouse JAM.\n\nAfter a warm-up on the previous Tuesday where Michaël Pailloncy had given a talk at the local Toulouse Devops user group about Jenkins Pipeline ecosystem, we were ready for more digging :-).\n\nThe agenda\n\nWe had planned the day in two parts:\n\nMorning would be a more driven workshop with slides & exercises to be completed\n\nPizzas & beverages to split the day :-)\n\nAfternoon would be somehow like an Unconference, where people basically decide by themselves what they want to work on.\n\nWe planned to have 30 attendees. We ended up having 25.\nWe considered having more people, but finally decided that for a first time it would be better to start not too big.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nInfrastructure was sponsored by DigitalOcean.\n\nFor each attendee, we provisioned :\n\nOne Controller, preconfigured to be able to dynamically provision agents.\n\nOne staging environment\n\nOne production environment\n[ 1 ]\n\nOne SonarQube instance\n\nWorkshop content & infrastructure\n\nAfter an initial quick presentation to settle context and remind some general things about Continuous Delivery and Jenkins, we started the workshop per se.\n\nIt is composed of 3 parts, which are readable here [ 2 ], but very few people were able to start the part 3.\n\nHackergarten / Unconference\n\nSo we let people decide what they wanted to work on during the afternoon.\n\nWe decided to use post-its: each attendee would write down what they wanted to work on, one idea per post-it (max 2 per person).\nThen, we dropped those onto a white-board and tried grouping those by theme.\n\nIn the end, overall, the following themes went out:\n\nHack on Jenkins development & Contribute to Jenkins\n\nComplete the workshops\n\nWork on use-case oriented things\n\nWork on Docker & Pipeline join usages\n\nHackergarten\n\nMany Jenkins accounts were created, and many JIRA and pull requests were filed.\nIt was nice to see people asking questions like: \"so, should I create a JIRA issue for this?\" or \"how do I interact with people\".\nPretty generic \"how do I work on open source software\" questions sometimes, but important because you felt like people were genuinely interested and needed not much to start contributing.\n\nHere are the pull requests filed during this afternoon:\n\nblueocean-pipeline-editor-plugin#30\n\njenkins#2785\n\njenkins#2786\n\njenkins#2787\n\njenkins#2788\n\nYou can see that though most of the PRs were typo-related, the one that got merged first was the one about code :-).\n\nSo, Jeremie Violas wins the Bobble Head as promised!\n\nWhy so many typo-related PRs?\n\nSimply because people were somehow encouraged to find some to get used to the\nround trip of: fixing an issue and filing the associated pull request, rinse &\nrepeat.\n\nI do think this is also a pretty nice and simple first step to understand how\nto build Jenkins and start interacting with the community.\n\nThe result\n\nPeople seemed pretty happy and we got some nice comments like \"now I have a clearer vision of what this Pipeline thing is about\".\nSome attendees also dropped nice comments on the meetup page.\nSo it’s cool because when you’re doing such things on your free time, it’s the main reward you can get.\n\nIf you’re an attendee to such events, don’t forget to thank people organizing\nthose, and more importantly to provide constructive feedback.  We are generally\neager to know what could be done better for next time.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall we are very happy with the energy of that day, and we definitely plan to set up a new session in the next few months, probably with a bit more people.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\nInfrastructure: when you plan to have many VM per attendee, double-check the limits your Cloud Provider may have by default. I had bumped it to 250 the day before the workshop, and asked for another one to 500 during the workshop (though in the end, 250 was probably enough, but this’ll give room for the next time with more people :-)).\n\nLogistics: warning, secret ahead: this is very time consuming.\nNot necessarily the amount of work itself, more that it implies very big latency.\nFor instance, give it 2 to 3 weeks minimum to have answers about sponsoring in general. Pinging again in case of no answer after 2 days would probably be seen as rude, and possibly lead to make things worse for obvious reasons, so plan ahead.\n\nThank you\n\nDigitalOcean for sponsoring the Infrastructure\n\nWe got way more than 100 VMs running at the same time during the day thanks to their help!\n\nHarryCow Coworking for hosting the event\n\nTo CloudBees for sponsoring the food for all the participants\n\nAlso for providing a bunch of goodies: stickers and T-Shirts for everybody\n\nGitHub for providing stickers\n\n1. For the sake of the simplicity of the workshop, those environments were actually a single VM: the goal was here to illustrate what we could do using Jenkins Pipeline, discussing scalability or more involved deployment techniques was obviously out of scope.\n\n2. in French only for now, but translating it into English to make it possibly shared and reusable among JAMs is being discussed","title":"Pipeline Workshop & Hackergarten @ ToulouseJAM Feedback","tags":["hackergarten","jam","meetup","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://batmat.net","github":"batmat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Baptiste has been using and contributing to Jenkins since it was called differently, and is a huge proponent of the Agile, Devops &amp; Continuous Delivery movements.\nHe loves to discuss not only the technical aspects, but also the even more essential cultural aspects of this all, working together to improve the value provided to customers in a great inclusive and blameless environment.</p>\n</div>","id":"batmat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Baptiste Mathus","slug":"/blog/author/batmat","twitter":"bmathus"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"6fbbc66f-434f-5721-89f0-d9f144eac41e","slug":"/blog/2017/03/20/security-updates/","strippedHtml":"Multiple Jenkins plugins received updates today that fix several security vulnerabilities:\n\nActive Directory\n\nDistributed Fork\n\nEmail Extension (Email-ext)\n\nMailer\n\nSSH Build Agents\n\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\n\nAdditionally, we also published a security notice for the following plugin and recommend that users disable and uninstall it:\n\nPipeline: Classpath Step\n\nThis plugin is not part of the Pipeline suite of plugins, despite its name.

Among the thousands of hackers in attendance\nwere a dozen or so Jenkins contributors. We have attended the event in the\npast, but this year we had a blizzard of activity spanning four days around the FOSDEM\nweekend.\n\nFigure 1. City Hall, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nOne of our \"accidental traditions\" has become a\nhappy hour\nthe Friday night before FOSDEM truly begins at Cafe Le Roy d’Espagne on Grand\nPlace right in the middle of Brussels. Conveniently located a few hundred meters away from the\nFOSDEM Beer Event\nat Delirium Cafe, each year we are inevitably joined by friends from other open\nsource projects who know they’re welcome to join us for a few drinks.\n\nFigure 2. Cafe Le Roy, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nAfter dinner and drinks, a few of us decided it would be a good idea (it\nwasn’t) to walk over to check out the FOSDEM Beer Event and maybe have just\none more beer. For the uninitiated, Belgian beers tend to be strong, as the FOSDEM organizers warn:\n\nUnlike some other beers, Belgian beer is not just coloured water. Some beers\ncontain significant quantities of alcohol and will give you a pounding\nhangover.\n\nUnfortunately, some of us seem to re-learn this lesson each year at FOSDEM!\n\nBright and early the following day, FOSDEM really kicked off with keynotes and\nthe project tables lining a number of corridors.\n\nFigure 3. A busy hall at FOSDEM, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nAt the Jenkins project’s table we typically spend two full days answering questions,\nshowing off the latest and greatest Jenkins features, and of course handing out\nJenkins stickers. The table is where many contributors, myself included, have\na rare opportunity to talk with dozens of enthusiastic Jenkins users from\nacross the broader open source community. This year we were very fortunate to have a\ntremendous number of contributors available at the table to answer hundreds of\nquestions throughout the two days of FOSDEM.\n\nI would like to thank everybody by name, but the entire weekend was such a blur\nthat I’m not sure I would be able to remember everybody who helped! We couldn’t have\nhad a successful event without their support, so many thanks to all the\ncontributors who helped!\n\nIn addition to the Jenkins project table, we had two contributors present in\nthe\nTesting and Automation\ndevroom, which I helped organize in between answering Jenkins questions.\n\nDeclarative Pipelines in Jenkins\n\nThe first presentation was a stellar introduction to\nDeclarative Pipelines\nin Jenkins, by long-time contributor and primary developer of Declarative\nPipeline support,\nAndrew Bayer.\n\nUsing Containers for Building and Testing\n\nLater in the day,\nCarlos Sanchez,\nanother long-time contributor, maintainer of the\nKubernetes plugin and a number of Jenkins- and Maven-related\nDocker containers, provided a great overview of the current state of using\ncontainers for building and testing in Jenkins.\n\nAfter a very busy two days at FOSDEM, a few contributors remained in Brussels\nfor a day-long\nPost-FOSDEM Contributor Hackathon\nsponsored by CloudBees, Inc. and\nBetacowork Brussels. Trying to cram lots of\nhacking into a single day is challenging, so the day was mostly filled with\ndiscussions, some light prototyping, and a bit of recovery from the hectic\nweekend at FOSDEM. :)\n\nFigure 4. Daniel Beck presenting on CLI prototyping, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nThanks\n\nOf course I would like to extend many thanks to all the contributors who\nparticipated in the various FOSDEM related events, but I would call special\nattention to the logistics and planning work done by contributors Alyssa Tong,\nDamien Duportal, and Olivier Vernin. Thanks to their work coordinating all the\nplans, reservations, and schedules, we had a flawless weekend\nof high-intensity Jenkins discussion, advocacy, and hacking.\n\nI hope to see everybody back in Brussels next year for FOSDEM 2018!","title":"FOSDEM 2017 Wrap-up","tags":["fosdem","event"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
