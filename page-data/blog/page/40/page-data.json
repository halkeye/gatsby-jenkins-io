Easily installed as a plugin for Jenkins and integrated\nwith Jenkins Pipeline, it is available from today for production use.\n\nSince the start of the beta at Jenkins World 2016 in September there are now\nover 7400+ installations making use of Blue Ocean. This wouldn’t be possible\nwithout the support of the entire Jenkins developer and\nuser community - so thank you for your support!\n\nBlue Ocean is available today from the update center and also as a\nDocker image - why not give it a try?\n\nVisual Pipeline Editing - Team members of any skill level can create continuous\ndelivery pipelines from start to finish, with just several clicks, using the\nintuitive, visual pipeline editor. Any pipeline created with the visual editor\ncan also be edited in your favorite text editor\nbringing all the benefits of Pipeline as Code.\n\nPipeline Visualization - Developers can visually represent pipelines in a way\nthat anyone on the team can understand - even your boss’s boss - improving\nclarity into the continuous delivery process for the whole organization.\nThe visualization helps you focus on what the pipeline does, not how it does it.\n\nPinpoint Troubleshooting - Blue Ocean enables developers to locate automation\nproblems instantly, without endlessly scanning through logs or navigating\nthrough many screens, so you can get back to building the next big thing.\n\nGitHub and Git Integration - Pipelines are created for all feature branches\nand pull requests, with their status reported back to GitHub.\nThe whole team has visibility into whether changes need work or are good to go.\n\nPersonalization – Every team member can make Jenkins their own by customizing\nthe dashboard so that they only see those pipelines that matter to them.\nFavoriting any pipeline or branch in Blue Ocean will show a favourite card on\nthe dashboard so you can see its status at a glance.\n\nJust one more thing – I’d like to pay special thanks to:\n\nThe Core team – to Keith Zantow, Thorsten Scherler, Tom Fennelly,\nIvan Meredith, Josh McDonald, Vivek Pandey, Brody Maclean and Cliff Meyers.\nEach of and everyone of you have brought your own passion, expertise and flair\nto the project – and it shows. It’s been crazy fun and I hope working on\nBlue Ocean is something you look back on fondly.\n\nJenkins Developers past and present – we recognise that we are standing on\nthe shoulders of giants and none of this wouldn’t be possible without your\nhard work and dedication to free & open source software and Jenkins.\nHere’s to the next 10 years 🍻 !\n\nCloudBees – in particular, Sacha Labourey (CEO), Harpreet Singh\n(VP of Product) and Spike Washburn (VP of Engineering) whose dedication to\nJenkins, Open Source and continued faith in the vision and team made all of\nthis possible, and of course Bob Bickel (Advisor) who dared us to dream big.\n\nMichael Neale – who drank all the kool-aide and is just as obsessed with\nand dedicated to Blue Ocean as I am. This project would never have shipped\nwithout his hand steady at the tiller. I couldn’t ask for a better friend\nand partner-in-crime.\n\nTyler Croy – for guiding the project and myself on how to do open source\nThe Right Way™. Tyler works tirelessly behind the scenes to to make Jenkins\nawesome and it wouldn’t be possible to keep this show running without\nhis help and sage-like advice.\n\nKohsuke Kawaguchi – For creating Jenkins, getting Blue Ocean off of\nthe ground, his tour of Tokyo and above all, his trust.\n\nJenkins Users – your enthusiasm for better development tools which\nkept our spirits and momentum up when the days grew long and things\nlooked tough. We couldn’t ask for a better, more appreciative or\npassionate group of people. Hopefully we’ve done our job and you can get\nback to building your next big thing!\n\nNext stop, some well needed rest & recovery then back to to making\nJenkins one of the experiences for software developers worldwide!\n\nIf you’re interested in joining us to make Blue Ocean a great user experience\nfor Jenkins, please join the Blue Ocean development\nteam on Gitter!","title":"Say hello to Blue Ocean 1.0","tags":["blueocean","ux","pipeline"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"i386","html":"","id":"i386","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"James Dumay","slug":"/blog/authors/i386","twitter":"i386"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ef0f71cf-7b8f-528c-bdbf-cb7997704db5","slug":"/blog/2017/04/05/welcome-to-blue-ocean/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Liam Newman,\nTechnical Evangelist at CloudBees.\n\nWelcome to Blue Ocean 1.0!\n\nIn case you’ve been heads down on other projects\nfor the past 10 months,\nBlue Ocean is a new user experience for Jenkins,\nand version 1.0 was released today!\nBlue Ocean makes Jenkins, and continuous delivery, approachable to all team members.\nI’ve been working with it for the past several months, and I can tell you it is amazing.\nI wish all the interactions with Jenkins were as easy as this:\n\n10 minutes to Blue Ocean\n\nBlue Ocean is simple to install and will work on basically any Jenkins 2 instance (version 2.7 or later).\nEven better, it runs side-by-side with the existing Jenkins web UI -\nyou can switch back and forth between them whenever you like.\nThere’s really no risk.\nIf you have a Jenkins instance and a good network connection,\nin 10 minutes you could be using Blue Ocean.\n\nLogin to your Jenkins server\n\nClick Manage Jenkins in the sidebar then Manage Plugins\n\nChoose the Available tab and use the search bar to find Blue Ocean\n\nClick the checkbox in the Install column\n\nClick either Install without restart or Download now and install after\nrestart\n\nAfter you install Blue Ocean, you can start using it\nby clicking on Open Blue Ocean in the navigation bar of the\nJenkins web UI, or you can navigate directly to Blue Ocean by adding\n/blue to your Jenkins URL, for example https://ci.jenkins.io/blue .\n\nIf you have to go back to the \"classic\" Jenkins UI,\nthere’s an \"exit\" icon located at the top of every page in Blue Ocean.\n\nDive in!\n\nThat’s it!

Adoption of Jenkins 2, which featured \"Pipeline as code\" and\nencouraged users to adopt Jenkins Pipeline, has\nskyrocketed to more than half of all Jenkins installations.

We ended up having 25.\nWe considered having more people, but finally decided that for a first time it would be better to start not too big.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nInfrastructure was sponsored by DigitalOcean.\n\nFor each attendee, we provisioned :\n\nOne Controller, preconfigured to be able to dynamically provision agents.\n\nOne staging environment\n\nOne production environment\n[ 1 ]\n\nOne SonarQube instance\n\nWorkshop content & infrastructure\n\nAfter an initial quick presentation to settle context and remind some general things about Continuous Delivery and Jenkins, we started the workshop per se.\n\nIt is composed of 3 parts, which are readable here [ 2 ], but very few people were able to start the part 3.\n\nHackergarten / Unconference\n\nSo we let people decide what they wanted to work on during the afternoon.\n\nWe decided to use post-its: each attendee would write down what they wanted to work on, one idea per post-it (max 2 per person).\nThen, we dropped those onto a white-board and tried grouping those by theme.\n\nIn the end, overall, the following themes went out:\n\nHack on Jenkins development & Contribute to Jenkins\n\nComplete the workshops\n\nWork on use-case oriented things\n\nWork on Docker & Pipeline join usages\n\nHackergarten\n\nMany Jenkins accounts were created, and many JIRA and pull requests were filed.\nIt was nice to see people asking questions like: \"so, should I create a JIRA issue for this?\" or \"how do I interact with people\".\nPretty generic \"how do I work on open source software\" questions sometimes, but important because you felt like people were genuinely interested and needed not much to start contributing.\n\nHere are the pull requests filed during this afternoon:\n\nblueocean-pipeline-editor-plugin#30\n\njenkins#2785\n\njenkins#2786\n\njenkins#2787\n\njenkins#2788\n\nYou can see that though most of the PRs were typo-related, the one that got merged first was the one about code :-).\n\nSo, Jeremie Violas wins the Bobble Head as promised!\n\nWhy so many typo-related PRs?\n\nSimply because people were somehow encouraged to find some to get used to the\nround trip of: fixing an issue and filing the associated pull request, rinse &\nrepeat.\n\nI do think this is also a pretty nice and simple first step to understand how\nto build Jenkins and start interacting with the community.\n\nThe result\n\nPeople seemed pretty happy and we got some nice comments like \"now I have a clearer vision of what this Pipeline thing is about\".\nSome attendees also dropped nice comments on the meetup page.\nSo it’s cool because when you’re doing such things on your free time, it’s the main reward you can get.\n\nIf you’re an attendee to such events, don’t forget to thank people organizing\nthose, and more importantly to provide constructive feedback.  We are generally\neager to know what could be done better for next time.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall we are very happy with the energy of that day, and we definitely plan to set up a new session in the next few months, probably with a bit more people.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\nInfrastructure: when you plan to have many VM per attendee, double-check the limits your Cloud Provider may have by default. I had bumped it to 250 the day before the workshop, and asked for another one to 500 during the workshop (though in the end, 250 was probably enough, but this’ll give room for the next time with more people :-)).\n\nLogistics: warning, secret ahead: this is very time consuming.\nNot necessarily the amount of work itself, more that it implies very big latency.\nFor instance, give it 2 to 3 weeks minimum to have answers about sponsoring in general. Pinging again in case of no answer after 2 days would probably be seen as rude, and possibly lead to make things worse for obvious reasons, so plan ahead.\n\nThank you\n\nDigitalOcean for sponsoring the Infrastructure\n\nWe got way more than 100 VMs running at the same time during the day thanks to their help!\n\nHarryCow Coworking for hosting the event\n\nTo CloudBees for sponsoring the food for all the participants\n\nAlso for providing a bunch of goodies: stickers and T-Shirts for everybody\n\nGitHub for providing stickers\n\n1. For the sake of the simplicity of the workshop, those environments were actually a single VM: the goal was here to illustrate what we could do using Jenkins Pipeline, discussing scalability or more involved deployment techniques was obviously out of scope.\n\n2. in French only for now, but translating it into English to make it possibly shared and reusable among JAMs is being discussed","title":"Pipeline Workshop & Hackergarten @ ToulouseJAM Feedback","tags":["hackergarten","jam","meetup","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8e8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/ede19/batmat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/bc20c/batmat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/b691b/batmat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/8ba60/batmat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/a9ea7/batmat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/51559/batmat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/28f98/batmat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":130}}},"blog":"http://batmat.net","github":"batmat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Baptiste has been using and contributing to Jenkins since it was called differently, and is a huge proponent of the Agile, Devops &amp; Continuous Delivery movements.\nHe loves to discuss not only the technical aspects, but also the even more essential cultural aspects of this all, working together to improve the value provided to customers in a great inclusive and blameless environment.</p>\n</div>","id":"batmat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Baptiste Mathus","slug":"/blog/authors/batmat","twitter":"bmathus"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"6fbbc66f-434f-5721-89f0-d9f144eac41e","slug":"/blog/2017/03/20/security-updates/","strippedHtml":"Multiple Jenkins plugins received updates today that fix several security vulnerabilities:\n\nActive Directory\n\nDistributed Fork\n\nEmail Extension (Email-ext)\n\nMailer\n\nSSH Build Agents\n\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\n\nAdditionally, we also published a security notice for the following plugin and recommend that users disable and uninstall it:\n\nPipeline: Classpath Step\n\nThis plugin is not part of the Pipeline suite of plugins, despite its name.

Among the thousands of hackers in attendance\nwere a dozen or so Jenkins contributors. We have attended the event in the\npast, but this year we had a blizzard of activity spanning four days around the FOSDEM\nweekend.\n\nFigure 1. City Hall, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nOne of our \"accidental traditions\" has become a\nhappy hour\nthe Friday night before FOSDEM truly begins at Cafe Le Roy d’Espagne on Grand\nPlace right in the middle of Brussels. Conveniently located a few hundred meters away from the\nFOSDEM Beer Event\nat Delirium Cafe, each year we are inevitably joined by friends from other open\nsource projects who know they’re welcome to join us for a few drinks.\n\nFigure 2. Cafe Le Roy, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nAfter dinner and drinks, a few of us decided it would be a good idea (it\nwasn’t) to walk over to check out the FOSDEM Beer Event and maybe have just\none more beer. For the uninitiated, Belgian beers tend to be strong, as the FOSDEM organizers warn:\n\nUnlike some other beers, Belgian beer is not just coloured water. Some beers\ncontain significant quantities of alcohol and will give you a pounding\nhangover.\n\nUnfortunately, some of us seem to re-learn this lesson each year at FOSDEM!\n\nBright and early the following day, FOSDEM really kicked off with keynotes and\nthe project tables lining a number of corridors.\n\nFigure 3. A busy hall at FOSDEM, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nAt the Jenkins project’s table we typically spend two full days answering questions,\nshowing off the latest and greatest Jenkins features, and of course handing out\nJenkins stickers. The table is where many contributors, myself included, have\na rare opportunity to talk with dozens of enthusiastic Jenkins users from\nacross the broader open source community. This year we were very fortunate to have a\ntremendous number of contributors available at the table to answer hundreds of\nquestions throughout the two days of FOSDEM.\n\nI would like to thank everybody by name, but the entire weekend was such a blur\nthat I’m not sure I would be able to remember everybody who helped! We couldn’t have\nhad a successful event without their support, so many thanks to all the\ncontributors who helped!\n\nIn addition to the Jenkins project table, we had two contributors present in\nthe\nTesting and Automation\ndevroom, which I helped organize in between answering Jenkins questions.\n\nDeclarative Pipelines in Jenkins\n\nThe first presentation was a stellar introduction to\nDeclarative Pipelines\nin Jenkins, by long-time contributor and primary developer of Declarative\nPipeline support,\nAndrew Bayer.\n\nUsing Containers for Building and Testing\n\nLater in the day,\nCarlos Sanchez,\nanother long-time contributor, maintainer of the\nKubernetes plugin and a number of Jenkins- and Maven-related\nDocker containers, provided a great overview of the current state of using\ncontainers for building and testing in Jenkins.\n\nAfter a very busy two days at FOSDEM, a few contributors remained in Brussels\nfor a day-long\nPost-FOSDEM Contributor Hackathon\nsponsored by CloudBees, Inc. and\nBetacowork Brussels. Trying to cram lots of\nhacking into a single day is challenging, so the day was mostly filled with\ndiscussions, some light prototyping, and a bit of recovery from the hectic\nweekend at FOSDEM. :)\n\nFigure 4. Daniel Beck presenting on CLI prototyping, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nThanks\n\nOf course I would like to extend many thanks to all the contributors who\nparticipated in the various FOSDEM related events, but I would call special\nattention to the logistics and planning work done by contributors Alyssa Tong,\nDamien Duportal, and Olivier Vernin. Thanks to their work coordinating all the\nplans, reservations, and schedules, we had a flawless weekend\nof high-intensity Jenkins discussion, advocacy, and hacking.\n\nI hope to see everybody back in Brussels next year for FOSDEM 2018!","title":"FOSDEM 2017 Wrap-up","tags":["fosdem","event"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
