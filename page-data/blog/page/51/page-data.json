I am pursing my major in Computer\nScience & Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India.  I\nam very proficient in writing code in Python, C++, Java and currently getting\nfamiliar and hopefully good in Groovy too.\n\nI have internship experiences in renowned institutions like Google and VMware\nwhere I worked with some exciting technologies for example Knowledge Graphs,\nBigTable, SPARQL, RDF in Google. I am a passionate computer science student who\nis always interested in learning and looking for new challenges and\ntechnologies.That’s how I came across to Google Summer of Code where I am\nworking on some exciting data mining problems which you are going to encounter\nbelow in this blog.\n\nProject Overview\n\nJenkins has collected anonymous usage information of more than 100,000\ninstallations which includes set of plugins and their versions etc and also\nrelease history information of the upgrades. This data collection can be used\nfor various data mining experiments. The main goal of this project is to perform\nvarious analysis and studies over the available dataset to discover trends\nin data usage. This project will help us to learn more about the Jenkins\nusage by solving various problems, such as:\n\nPlugin versions installation trends, will let us know about the versions installation behaviour of a given plugin.\n\nSpotting downgrades, which will warn us that something is wrong with the version from which downgrading was performed.\n\nCorrelating what users are saying (community rating) with what users are doing (upgrades/downgrades).\n\nDistribution of cluster size, where clusters represents jobs, nodes count which approximates the size of installation.\n\nFinding set of plugins which are likely to be used together, will setup pillar for plugin recommendation system.\n\nAs a part of the Google Summer of Code 2016, I will be working on the above\nmentioned problems. My mentors for the project are Kohsuke Kawaguchi and Daniel Beck. Some analyses has already been done over this\ndata but those are outdated as charts can be more clearer and interactive. This project aims to improvise existing\nstatistics and generating new ones discussed above.\n\nUse Cases\n\nThis project covers wide-range of the use-cases that has been derived from the\nproblems mentioned above.\n\nUse Case 1: Upgrade/Downgrade Analysis\n\nUnderstanding the trend in upgrades and downgrades have lots of utilities, some\nof them have already been explained earlier which includes measuring the\npopularity, spotting downgrades, giving warning about the wrong versions quickly\netc.\n\nUse Case 1.1: Plugin versions installation trends\n\nHere we are analysing the trend in the different version installations for a\ngiven plugin. This use-case will help us to know about:\n\nTrend in the upgrade to the latest version released for a given plugin.\n\nTrend in the popularity decrement of the previous versions after new version release.\n\nFind the most popular plugin version at any given point of time.\n\nUse Case 1.2: Spotting dowgrades\n\nHere we are interested to know, how many installations are downgraded from any\ngiven version to previously used version. Far fetched goal of this analysis is\nto give warning when something goes wrong with the new version release, which\ncan be sensed using downgrades performed by users. This analysis can be\naccomplished by studying the monotonic property of the version number vs.\ntimestamp graph for a given plugin.\n\nUse Case 1.3: Correlation with the perceived quality of Jenkins release\n\nTo correlate what users are saying to what users are doing, we have community\nratings which tells us about the ratings and reviews of the releases and has\nfollowing parameters:\n\nUsed the release on production site w/o major issues.\n\nDon’t recommend to other.\n\nTried but rolled it back to the previous version.\n\nFirst parameters can be calculated from the Jenkins usage data and third\nparameter is basically spotting downgrades(use case 1.2). But the second\nparameter is basically an expression which is not possible to calculate. This\nanalysis is just to get a subjective idea about the correlation.\n\nUse Case 2: Plugin Recommendation System\n\nThis section involves setting up ground work for the plugin recommendation\nsystem. The idea is to find out the set of plugins which are most likely to be\nused together. Here we will be following both content based filtering as well as\ncollaborative filtering approach.\n\nCollaborative Filtering\n\nThis approach is based upon analysing large amount of information on\ninstallation’s behaviours and activities. We have implicit form of the data\nabout the plugins, that is for every install ids, we know the set of plugins\ninstalled. We can use this information to construct plugin usage graph where\nnodes are the plugins and the edges between them is the number of installations\nin which both plugins are installed together.\n\nContent-based Filtering\n\nThis method is based on a properties or the content of the item for example\nrecommending items that are similar to the those that a user liked in the past\nor examining in the present based upon some properties. Here, we are utilizing\nJenkins\nplugin dependency graph to learn about the properties of a plugin. This graph\ntells us about dependent plugins on a given plugin as well as its dependencies\non others. Here is an example to show, how this graph is use for content based\nfiletring, suppose if a user is using “CloudBees Cloud Connector”, then we can\nrecommend them for “CloudBees Registration Plugin” as both plugins are dependent\non “CloudBees Credentials Plugin”.\n\nAdditional Details\n\nYou may find the complete project proposal along with the detailed design of the\nuse-cases with their implementation details here in the\ndesign\ndocument.\n\nA complete version of the use-case 1: Upgrade & Downgrade Analysis should be\navailable in late June and basic version of plugin recommendation system will be\navailable in late July.\n\nI do appreciate any kind of feedback and suggestions.  You may add comments in\nthe\ndesign\ndoc.  I will be posting updates about the statistics generation status on the\njenkins-dev mailing\nlist and jenkins-infra mailing list.\n\nLinks:\n\nDesign Doc\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nGithub infra-stats\n\nJenkins statistics\n\nJenkins Plugin Dependency Graph\n\nGithub GSoC Jenkins Usage Statistics Analysis","title":"GSoC Project Intro: Usage Statistics Analysis","tags":["usage-statistics","gsoc"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"payal94","html":"","id":"payal94","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Payal Priyadarshini","slug":"/blog/authors/payal94","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","id":"29d1cef2-5ba3-567a-b9dc-18a27c3802aa","slug":"/blog/2016/06/13/june-jenkins-events/","strippedHtml":"It is hard to believe that the first half of 2016 is almost over and summer is\njust around the corner.

Several other EC2 customers like Mozilla have\nalso reduced costs of their\ncontinuous integration, deployment and testing pipelines by up to 90% on Spot instances. You can view\nthe current savings on Spot instances over EC2 On-demand instances using the\nSpot Bid Advisor :\n\nAWS Spot instances are spare EC2 instances that you can bid on. While your Spot instances may be\nterminated when EC2’s spare capacity declines, you can automatically replenish these instances and\nmaintain your target capacity using\nEC2 Spot fleets. As each\ninstance type and Availability Zone provides an alternative capacity pool, you can select multiple\nsuch pools to launch the lowest priced instances currently available by launching a Spot\nfleet on the Amazon EC2 Spot Requests console\nor using the AWS CLI/SDK tools.\n\nIn this walkthrough, we’ll show you how to configure Jenkins to automatically scale a fleet of Spot\ninstances up or down depending on the number jobs to be completed.\n\nRequest an Amazon EC2 Spot fleet\n\nTo get started, login to Amazon EC2 console, and click on Spot Requests\nin the left hand navigation pane. Alternatively, you can directly login to\nAmazon EC2 Spot Requests console. Then click on the\nRequest Spot Instances button at the top of the dashboard.\n\nIn the Spot instance launch wizard, select the Request & Maintain option to request a Spot fleet that automatically\nprovisions the most cost-effective EC2 Spot instances, and replenishes them if interrupted. Enter an initial\ntarget capacity, choose an AMI, and select multiple instance types to automatically provision the lowest priced\ninstances available.\n\nOn the next page, ensure that you have selected a key pair, complete the launch wizard, and note the Spot\nfleet request ID.\n\nAmazon EC2 Spot fleet automates finding the lowest priced instances for you, and enables your Jenkins cluster\nto maintain the required capacity; so, you don’t need any bidding algorithms to provision the optimal Spot\ninstances over time.\n\nConfigure Jenkins\n\nInstall the Plugin\n\nFrom the Jenkins dashboard, select Manage Jenkins, and then click Manage Plugins. On the Available tab,\nsearch for and select the EC2 Fleet Jenkins Plugin. Then click the Install button.\n\nAfter the plugin installation is completed, select Manage Jenkins from the Jenkins dashboard, and\nclick Configure System. In the Cloud section, select Amazon Spot Fleet to add a new Cloud.\n\nConfigure AWS Credentials\n\nNext, we will configure the AWS and agent node credentials. Click the Add button next to AWS Credentials,\nselect Jenkins, and enter your AWS Access Key, secret, and ID.\n\nNext, click the Add button in the Spot fleet launcher to configure your agents with an SSH key.\nSelect Jenkins, and enter the username and private key (from the key pair you configured in your Spot fleet request)\nas shown below.\n\nConfirm that the AWS and SSH credentials you just added are selected. Then choose the region, and the Spot fleet\nrequest ID from the drop-down. You can also enter the maximum idle time before your cluster automatically scales\ndown, and the maximum cluster size that it can scale up to.\n\nSubmit Jobs and View Status\n\nAfter you have finished the previous step, you can view the EC2 Fleet Status in the left hand navigation pane on\nthe Jenkins dashboard. Now, as you submit more jobs, Jenkins will automatically scale your Spot fleet to add more\nnodes. You can view these new nodes executing jobs under the Build Executor Status.\nAfter the jobs are done, if the nodes remain free for the specified idle time (configured in the previous step),\nthen Jenkins releases the nodes, automatically scaling down your Spot fleet nodes.\n\nBuild faster and cheaper\n\nIf you have a story to share about your team or product, or have a question to ask, do leave a comment\nfor us; we’d love to connect with you!","title":"Save up to 90% of CI cost on AWS with Jenkins and EC2 Spot Fleet","tags":["aws","plugins","ec2"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"Cyberax","html":"","id":"cyberax","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Aleksei Besogonov","slug":"/blog/authors/cyberax","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"2ec37d75-53e9-562c-9bbb-de2a06ecbafd","slug":"/blog/2016/06/01/gsoc-automatic-plugin-documentation/","strippedHtml":"About me\n\nI am Cynthia Anyango from Nairobi, Kenya. I am a second year student at Maseno\nUniversity. I am currently specializing on Ruby on Rails and trying to learn\nPython. I recently started contributing to Open source projects.My major\ncontribution was at Mozilla, where I worked with the QA for Cloud services. I did\nmanual and automated tests for various cloud services. I wrote documentation\ntoo. Above that, I am competent and I am always passionate about what I get my\nhands on.\n\nProject summary\n\nCurrently Jenkins plugin documentation is being stored in Confluence. Sometimes\nthe documentation is scattered and outdated. In order to improve the situation we\nwould like to follow the documentation-as-code approach and to put docs to\nplugin repositories and then publish them on the project website using the\nawestruct engine. The project aims an implementation of a documentation\ncontinuous deployment flow powered by Jenkins and Pipeline Plugin.\n\nThe idea is to automatically pull in the README and other docs from GitHub, show\nchangelogs with versions and releases dates. I will be designing file templates\nthat will contain most of the  docs information that will be required from\nplugin developers. Initially the files will be written in\nAsciiDoc.

I\ninterned at Intel and Yandex, and cofounded a startup\nproject where I personally developed front-end and back-end of the website.\n\nI am excited to participate in GSoC with Jenkins this summer as a chanсe to make\na positive change for thousands of users as well as to learn from great mentors.\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough powerful, Jenkins new job creation and configuration process may be non\nobvious and time consuming. This can be improved by making UI more intuitive,\nconcise, and functional. I plan to achieve this by creating a simpler new job\ncreation, configuration process focused on essential elements, and embedding new\nfunctionality.\n\nMy mentors are Kirill Merkushev and\nMichael Neale\n\nDeliverables\n\nNew job creation\n\nNew job name validation\n\nInitially, job validation was unresponsive, job creation was still allowed with\nan invalid name, and some allowed characters even crashed Jenkins. Happily, two\nof this problems were fixed in recent improvements and I plan add only a real\ntime name check for invalid characters.\n\nPopup window\n\nJenkins has a lot of windows reloads that may time consuming. The creation of\nnew job is a simple process requiring only job name and job type. This way UI\nmay be improved by reducing page reloads and putting new job creation interface\nin a dialog window. Such popup would likely consist of three steps of\nimplementation: rendering a dialog window, receiving JSON with job types,\nsending a POST request to create the job.\n\nConfiguration page\n\nChanging help information\n\nAs reported by some users, it would be useful to have the functionality to\nchange help information. Installation administrators would be able to change the\nhelp info and choose editing rights for other users. That would likely require a\ncreation of extension points and a plugin using them. I also would like to\ninclude the ability to style the help information using markdown as shown above.\n\n[Optional] The functionality is extended to creation of crowd sourced \"wiki like\" documentation\n\nAs in\nlocalization\nplugin the changes are gathered and applied beyond installation of a particular\nuser.\n\nMore intuitive configuration page.\n\nPursuing to solve this  issue\n\nAlthough there are a lot improvements in new configuration page, there is always\na room for improvements. An advanced job still has a very complicated and hard\nto read configuration page. It is still open to discussion, but I may approach\nit by better division of configuration parts such as an accordion based\nnavigation.\n\nHome page\n\n[Optional] Removing \"My Views\" page\n\n\"My Views\" page may unnecessary complicate essential sidepanel navigation. Since\nit contains very small functionality, the functions may be moved to the home\npage and the whole page may be removed. That may be implemented by adding icons\nto \"My Views\" tabs. Additionally, the standard view creation page can create\neither of the types\n\n[Optional] Reducing number of UI elements\n\nThe home page may contain some UI elements that are not essential and rarely\nused. This way elements \"enable auto refresh\", “edit description”, “icon sizes”,\n”legend”, “RSS” may be removed from home page and placed under \"Manage Jenkins\"\nor an upper menu. It is also possible to create new extension points to support\nnew UI elements through plugins.\n\nCredentials store page\n\n[Optional] Grouping credentials and their domains\n\nCredentials page has too many reloads and requires many clicks to get to a\nrequired credentials page. That may be improved by removing the last page and\nshowing credentials under domains.\n\nCurrent progress\n\nBy May 25th I learned about the structure and tools of Jenkins and started\nworking on the first project:\n\nI started with New Job Name validation first. Luckily, in last updates the\nchanges of recena there\nwere implemented all of the changes I proposed except real time check on name\nvalidity. Here I proposed the change which fixes it by\nsending GET request on keyup event in addition to blur.\n\nI also made a New Job Popup with using existing interface.\n\nView the current\npop-up progress\n\nI used Remodal library for popup and put\nthere\nexisting\nNew Job container. Surprisingly, it was fully functional right away. On the GIF\nyou can see that popup receives all job types and then successfully submits the\npost form creating a new job. I think that could be a good first step. Further I\ncan start changing the window itself.\n\nLinks\n\nInitial proposal of the project\n\nThe project discussion on mailing list\n\nJenkins GSoC Page\n\nProject repository","title":"GSoC Project Intro: Improving Job Creation/Configuration","tags":["core","gsoc"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"samatdav","html":"","id":"samatdav","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Samat Davletshin","slug":"/blog/authors/samatdav","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"bbd7c8d9-ad20-56ae-b97b-834547d227f7","slug":"/blog/2016/05/26/introducing-blue-ocean/","strippedHtml":"In recent years developers have become rapidly attracted to tools that are not\nonly functional but are designed to fit into their workflow seamlessly and are\na joy to use. This shift represents a higher standard of design and user\nexperience that Jenkins needs to rise to meet.\n\nWe are excited to share and invite the community to join us on a project we’ve\nbeen thinking about over the last few months called Blue Ocean.\n\nBlue Ocean is a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modelling\nand presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information that’s\nimportant to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still\nstaying true to the extensibility that is core to Jenkins.\n\nWhile this project is in the alpha stage of development, the intent is that\nJenkins users can install Blue Ocean side-by-side with the Jenkins Classic UI\nvia a plugin.\n\nNot all the features listed on this blog are complete but we will be hard at\nwork over the next few months preparing Blue Ocean for general use. We intend\nto provide regular updates on this blog as progress is made.\n\nBlue Ocean is open source today\nand we invite you to give us feedback and to contribute to the project.\n\nBlue Ocean will provide development teams:\n\nNew modern user experience\n\nThe UI aims to improve clarity, reduce clutter and navigational depth to make\nthe user experience very concise. A modern visual design gives developers much\nneeded relief throughout their daily usage and screens respond instantly to\nchanges on the server making manual page refreshes a thing of the past.\n\nAdvanced Pipeline visualisations with built-in failure diagnosis\n\nPipelines are visualised on screen along with the\nsteps and logs to allow simplified comprehension of the continuous delivery\npipeline – from the simple to the most sophisticated scenarios.\n\nScrolling through 10,000 line log files is a thing of the past. Blue Ocean\nbreaks down your log per step and calls out where your build failed.\n\nBranch and Pull Request awareness\n\nModern pipelines make use of multiple Git branches, and Blue Ocean is designed\nwith this in mind. Drop a Jenkinsfile into your Git\nrepository that defines your pipeline and Jenkins will automatically discover\nand start automating any  Branches and validating Pull Requests.\n\nJenkins will report the status of your pipeline right inside Github or\nBitbucket on all your commits, branches or pull requests.\n\nPersonalised View\n\nFavourite any pipelines, branches or pull requests and see them appear on your\npersonalised dashboard. Intelligence is being built into the dashboard. Jobs\nthat need your attention, say a Pipeline waiting for approval or a failing job\nthat you have recently changed, appear on the top of the dashboard.\n\nYou can read more about Blue Ocean and its goals on the\nproject page and developers should watch the\nDevelopers list for more information.\n\nFor Jenkins developers and plugin authors:\n\nJenkins Design “Language”\n\nThe Jenkins Design Language (JDL) is a set of standardised React components and\na style guide that help developers create plugins that retain the look and feel\nof Blue Ocean in an effortless way. We will be publishing more on the JDL,\nincluding the style guide and developer documentation, over the next few weeks.\n\nModern JavaScript toolchain\n\nThe Jenkins plugin tool chain has been extended so that developers can use\nES6,\nReact, NPM\nin their plugins without endless yak-shaving. Jenkins\njs-modules are already in use in\nJenkins today, and this builds on this, using the same tooling.\n\nClient side Extension points\n\nClient Side plugins use Jenkins plugin infrastructure. The Blue Ocean libraries\nbuilt on ES6 and React.js provide an extensible client side component model\nthat looks familiar to developers who have built Jenkins plugins before. Client\nside extension points can help isolate failure, so one bad plugin doesn’t take\na whole page down.\n\nServer Sent Events\n\nServer Sent Events\n(SSE) allow plugin developers to tap into changes of state on the server and make\ntheir UI update in real time ( watch this for a\ndemo).\n\nTo make Blue Ocean a success, we’re asking for help and support from Jenkins\ndevelopers and plugin authors. Please join in our Blue Ocean discussions on the\nJenkins Developer\nmailing list and the #jenkins-ux IRC channel on Freenode!\n\nLinks\n\nBlue Ocean project page\n\nBlue Ocean GitHub repository","title":"Introducing Blue Ocean: a new user experience for Jenkins","tags":["blueocean","ux","pipeline"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"i386","html":"","id":"i386","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"James Dumay","slug":"/blog/authors/i386","twitter":"i386"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":400,"numPages":100,"currentPage":51}},
