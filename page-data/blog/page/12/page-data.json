This includes the\nsyntax of `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries, code sharing and reuse, testing of Pipelines and shared libraries, IDE\nintegration and other development tools, documentation, best practices, and examples.\n\nWhat Are The Focus Areas of the Pipeline-Authoring Special Interest Group\n\nSyntax - How `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries are written.\n\nCode sharing and reuse - Shared libraries and future improvements.\n\nTesting - Unit and functional testing of `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries.\n\nIDE integration, editors, and other development tools - IDE plugins, visual editors, etc.\n\nDocumentation - Reference documentation, tutorials, and more.\n\nBest practices - Defining, maintaining, and evangelizing best practices in Jenkins Pipeline.\n\nExamples - Real-world `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries demonstrating how to utilize various features of Pipeline,\nas well as basic or starter `Jenkinsfile`s for common patterns that can be used as jumping-off points by new users.\n\nWhat Have We Been Up To\n\nWith the start of a new year, members got together to discuss the roadmap for 2020. During the initial discussions we\ndetermined that it would be good to examine the goals of previous meetings and determine the best path forward.\n\nA mutual decision was made that to better create a roadmap; we needed to understand better who we were aiming to help.\nWe decided that creating personas was very beneficial. Personas are fictional characters, which we are creating based\nupon our research to represent the different user types that might use Jenkins pipelines.\nCreating personas can help us step out of ourselves. It can help us to recognize that different people have different\nneeds and expectations, and it can also help us to identify with the user we are building the roadmap for. Personas make\nthe task at hand less complicated, they guide our ideation processes, and they can help us to achieve the goal of\ncreating a good user experience for our target user group.\nA lot of that work can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdyzJwt50Wk3uUNsLMl2d4w2MGYss-phqet0s-KjbEs/edit\nThe idea is to map the personas to a maturity model and then map the maturity model to the actual documentation. That\nmaturity model can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ByzWlPU0j1qM_gqspJppkNKkR5ZVLWlB/view\n\nHow Can I Get Involved\n\nWe have been meeting regularly to define personas to help us better create the SIG roadmap. We meet twice a week,\nonce on Thursday for the EMEA timezone and once on Friday for the US timezone. Meeting notes can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1EhWoBplGl4M8bHz0uuP-iOynPGuONjcz4enQm8sDyUE/edit# and the calendar, if you would\nlike to attend, is here: https://jenkins.io/event-calendar/. The previous recording of the meetings are\nlocated here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz_kPpb9C1w&list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOKKLBXek6iG8wTS24Ac7Y3\n\nNext Steps\n\nWe have a lot of work to do and could use your help. If you would love to join us, check out the meeting link. If you\nwould like to check out the personas and give feedback, also check out the link.\nOnce we have wrapped up the personas work, we will start to identify the available documentation and ensure we have\nadequate documentation with the help of the Doc SIG.\nWe will finally then start working to build out tools to help the community with pipelines in Jenkins better.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you would like to get in touch with the Pipeline-Authoring SIG, you can by joining the\nPipeline-Authoring SIG gitter channel or via the\nPipeline-Authoring SIG mailing list","title":"Pipeline-Authoring SIG Update","tags":["Pipeline-Authoring","SIG","community","opensource"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

Enhance developer experience by developing a VSCode Plugin to facilitate autocompletion and validation which would help the developer write correct yaml files before application to a Jenkins Instance.\n\nThe Configuration as Code plugin has been designed as an opinionated way to configure Jenkins based on human-readable declarative configuration files. Writing such a file should be feasible without being a Jenkins expert, just translating into code a configuration process one is used to executing in the web UI. The plugin uses a schema to verify the files being applied to the Jenkins instance.\n\nWith the new JSON Schema being enabled developers can now test their yaml file against it. The schema checks the descriptors i.e. configuration that can be applied to a plugin or Jenkins core, the correct type is used and help text is provided in some cases. VSCode allows us to test out the schema right out of the box with some modifications. This project was built as part of the Community Bridge initiative which is a platform created by the Linux Foundation to empower developers — and the individuals and companies who support them — to advance sustainability, security, and diversity in open source technology. You can take a look at the Jenkins Community Bridge Project Page\n\nSteps to Enable the Schema Validation\n\na) The first step includes installing the JCasC Plugin for Visual Studio Code and opening up the extension via the extension list. Shortcut for opening the extension list in VSCode editor using Ctrl + Shift + X.\n\nb) In order to enable validation we need to include it in the workspace settings.\nNavigate to File and then Preference and then Settings. Inside settings search for json and inside settings.json include the following configuration.\n\n{\n\"yaml.schemas\": {\n        \"schema.json\": \"y[a]?ml\"\n    }\n}\n\nYou can specify a glob pattern as the value for schema.json which is the file name for the schema. This would apply the schema to all yaml files. eg:.[y[a]?ml]\n\nc) The following tasks can be done using VSCode:\n\na) Auto completion (Ctrl + Space):\n  Auto completes on all commands.\n\nb) Document Outlining (Ctrl + Shift + O):\nProvides the document outlining of all completed nodes in the file.\n\nd) Create a new file under the work directory called jenkins.yml. For example consider the following contents for the file:\n\njenkins:\n  systemMessage: “Hello World”\n  numExecutors: 2\n\nThe above yaml file is valid according to the schema and vscode should provide you with validation and autocompletion for the same.\n\nScreenshots\n\nWe are holding an online meetup on the 26th February regarding this plugin and how you could use it to validate your YAML configuration files.\nFor any suggestions or dicussions regarding the schema feel free to join our gitter channel.\nIssues can be created on Github.","title":"Validating JCasC configuration files using Visual Studio Code","tags":["community-bridge","JCasC","VSCode","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"sladyn98","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sladyn is a Computer Science student at Mumbai University, India.\nHe is participating in Community Bridge 2019 to provide development tools to JCasC plugin in the form of IDE integrations, schema architecture improvements and configuration extension points <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin\">Configuration as Code Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"sladyn98","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sladyn Nunes","slug":"/blog/author/sladyn98","twitter":"SladynN"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","id":"21c55fa8-27ea-50d0-a167-c780371a54d9","slug":"/blog/2020/02/19/jenkins-world-lisbon-with-love-from-india/","strippedHtml":"After an amazing three months of development period in the summer of 2019 with Jenkins Project, I was a better developer, loved open source, met\npassionate people and had fun at work. Jenkins is not just a community, it is a family. When GSoC period was over, we received swags from Jenkins.\nNatasha Stopa (one of the students in GSoC 2019) was invited to attend DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco.\nIt was nice to see her enjoy there. But guess what? Jenkins also invited three other students (Abhyudaya, Long and me) to DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon.\nI was super psyched when Marky Jackson (one of my project mentors) broke the news to me.\n\nThe trip to Lisbon required to sort a few things like flight tickets, hotel booking, passport, visa etc. Oleg Nenashev had scheduled meetings to discuss\nand help us with arranging everything for our travel. Thanks to him. :)\n\nFrom India to Lisbon (Dec 1)\n\nAbhyudaya and I boarded our flight from Indira Gandhi Airport (New Delhi) to Lisbon on December 1, 2019 morning at 0500 hours (local time). It was a fine\ntrip with an hour layover in Istanbul Ataturk Airport. We arrived in Lisbon at 1500 hours (local time). The weather in Lisbon was terrific. A mild cold\nbut strong sea breeze was the starting point of me falling in love with the place. We arrived at our hotel (Novotel Lisboa) in an Uber. Oleg met us at\nthe lobby to help us with check-in. It was great to finally meet him in person after months of knowing and working together. We had a good chat about the\nevent, what to expect and other sightseeing areas. After a short time of refresh, Long who traveled from Berlin a day before met us at the restaurant. We\nhad a brief chat knowing each other, had our food and went to bed. The next day was Hackfest. We hit the bed after that as we had to reach Centro de\nCongressos de Lisboa (CCL) where the event was organised by 0900 hours.\n\nDay 0 (Dec 2)\n\nI woke up early for a short jog in the streets. Lisbon is a city made on hills. The streets have beautiful mosaic styled pavements. It was\nnice to see around the city. Then Abhyudaya and me went for breakfast and reached CCL in an Uber at 0815 hours.\n\nThere was a round table sitting arrangement in an auditorium. It was like a meet-and-greet event to interact with other developers (some known and some new).\nEverybody had to figure out their problem statements and work on it. There was milk, juice, sandwiches which gave us energy throughout the day. I took a\nsmall break to come out of the building to go to the other side of the road which was on the banks of Tagus River. From there you could have very close\nview underneath the Ponte 25 de Abril (looks strikingly similar to Golden Gate Bridge). You can also see The Sanctuary of Christ the King on the other side\nof the river (again looks similar to Christ the Redeemer in Rio, Brazil). It was great to kick off the event with Hackfest. At the end of Hackfest some of\nus presented our work. Later, we went to a nearby restaurant to have burgers which apparently was the best burger I ever had (could be because I hadn’t\ntried too many burgers before :P). We talked and interacted with people from other parts of the world for about an hour and a half then went back to our hotel\nrooms.\n\nDay 1 (Dec 3)\n\nThe conference officially began on this day. Abyudaya and me had breakfast and took the shuttle to CCL. We collected our t-shirts and IDs. The event managing team\nmade an app for DevOps World | Jenkins World (DWJW) Lisbon with all schedules and other informations which was incredibly convenient for all attendees.\nThere were multiple sessions/events on different topics related to Jenkins or DevOps in general. I attended the Jenkins and Jenkins X contributor summit.\nHad a nice lunch and went around to explore Lisbon. I went to Padrao dos Descobrimentos and the beautiful Belem Palace. Had some Pasteis de Belem\n(a popular Portuguese desert). Took a tram to Praça do Comércio. It is Lisbon’s most important square. You will find lots of tourists, street bands,\nsea food restaurants, shops for every budget, the famous pink street and so much more. Later that evening we had a party hosted by EURODOG (European\nDevOps Group) at Lisboa Marriott. It was a nice party to network with developers over casual wine and beer. We later head out to a nearby Indian restaurant\nfor Kebab and rice.\n\nDay 2 (Dec 4)\n\nThe second day began with the opening keynote. Later went to the Jenkins X Introduction, Deploying K8s with Jenkins on GCP, Build top mobile games\nby King in that order. Also occasionally hitting the sponsors booth to have a chat and collect some swags. In the evening there was the superhero\nthemed party, sponsored by Sonatype. It was probably the most fun event in the entire conference. The expo hall had an entirely different look with the party lights on,\npeople wearing capes, fun events going around. There were artists dressed in a Bumblebee, a Batman, a Superman, a Supergirl, a Thor and more superhero\ncostumes! I was previously made aware of the interesting parties at Jenkins World but the experience was very different. People from all over the world had\ncome together to celebrate the 15 years of success of an open source software. After partying from 5 to 7 we went back to the hotel. I spent some time\nto prepare the slides for the next day’s presentation and went to bed.\n\nDay 3 (Dec 5)\n\nThe third and final day of conference began with Jenkins World Fun Run. I missed the keynote for being late and other setup required for the\npresentation. My laptop was broken so had to do all the setup for demo on a friend’s laptop. The situation felt like a Jenkins admin under fire\nfor a production bug. After being under pressure for a while, took a break to admire the developer comics and had a chat with the graffiti painter.\nDuring lunch it was time for the GSoC presentation at the Jenkins community booth. All our presentation went well and we also interacted with real users.\nThen we had the GSoC Team pic at the Jenkins community booth. Later Abhyudaya and me gave our presentation at the lightning talks as well upon Mark Waite’s\nrequest. The event concluded with emotional goodbyes.\n\nAll GSoC Students were invited for dinner at Corinthia Lisboa’s Soul Garden restaurant. The party comprised of Oleg, Mark and his lovely wife, Liam, Tracy,\nAlyssa and Olivier. We had a very nice conversation and I had a very delicious Bacalhau (cod fish) dish. Then bid final goodbye to everybody.\n\nIt was a wonderful experience in a wonderful country among wonderful people. Hats off to the management team lead by Alyssa Tong and co. An event this big was\ncarried out without any hiccups! Everybody contributed their part to the event which made it very interactive and fun. Checkout some of my swags:\n\nA big shout out to the Jenkins project and CloudBees for sponsoring this trip. Also thank you Jenkins and Google Summer of Code for support. :)","title":"My DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon Experience","tags":["gitlab","devopsworld","jenkinsworld","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/20305/baymac.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/eb017/baymac.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/ed0e7/baymac.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/20305/baymac.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/b3c75/baymac.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/bcdad/baymac.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/21187/baymac.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/33025/baymac.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/d386c/baymac.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":192}}},"blog":null,"github":"baymac","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2019 student under Jenkins project.

I had an early morning flight to Lisbon\nfrom Delhi via Istanbul. At the Airport, I met Parichay who had been\nwaiting there from his connecting flight. After flying 8000 km, we\nreached Lisbon. We took a taxi to the hotel and were greeted there by\none of my Google Summer of Code mentors, Oleg. After four months of\nworking with him on my GSoC project, meeting him was an amazing\nexperience. Later that day, after stretching our legs in the hotel, we\nmet Long for an early dinner, who came to the hotel after exploring much\nof Lisbon.\n\nDay 1: Hackfest, December 2\n\nNext morning, we all met for breakfast where we all got to taste some\nPastel de Nata. We then took a cab to the Congress Centre for attending\nthe Jenkins and Jenkins X hackfest. At the Hackfest, I met Mark, Joseph,\nKasper, Andrey and other Jenkins contributors. I also met Oleg, this\ntime together with his son and his wife. After our introductions, and a\nshort presentation by Oleg, I started hacking on the Folder Auth plugin\nand made it possible to delete user sids from roles. The best part of\nhacking there was to get instant feedback on what I was working on. More\nand more people kept coming throughout the day. It was great to see so\nmany people working hard to improve Jenkins. At the end, everyone\npresented what they had achieved that day. Having skipped lunch for some\nsnacks, Oleg and others tried hard to get some pizza delivered without\nmuch success. After the Hackfest, everyone was hungry and most attendees\nincluding me went looking for nearby restaurants. Since it was early and\nmost restaurants were not open yet, we all decided to have burgers. It\nwas a great learning experience listening to and talking about Jenkins,\nElasticsearch, Jira, GitHub and a lot of other things. After that, we\ntook a taxi back to the hotel and I went to bed.\n\nDay 2: Contributor Summit, December 3\n\nWe had the Jenkins and Jenkins X contributor summit the next day. Me and\nParichay took the bus to the Congress Centre in the morning. After\nregistration, I got my ‘Speaker’ badge and the conference T-shirt. The\ncontributor summit took place in the same hall as the Hackfest, but the\nseating arrangement was completely different and there were a lot more\npeople. The summit started with everyone introducing themselves. It\nturned out that there were a lot of people from Munich. There were\npresentations and talks about all things Jenkins, Jenkins X and the\nContinuous Delivery Foundation by Kohsuke, Oleg, Joseph, Liam, Olivier,\nWadek and others. I had no experience with Jenkins X which made the\nsummit very interesting. After lunch, the talks were over, and everyone\nwas free to join any session discussing various things about Jenkins. I\nattended the Cloud Native Jenkins and the Configuration-as-Code\nsessions.\n\nWhile some of the conference attendees were in the Contributor summit,\nthe others were going through certifications and trainings. At around 5\no’clock in the evening, the summit and the trainings all got over and\nthe expo hall was thrown open. On the entrance, there was a large stack\nof big DWJW bags. I did not realize why those bags were kept there.\nSince everyone was taking one, I took one as well. As soon as I went\ninto the hall, I realized that those bags were for collecting swag. I\nhad never seen anything like this where sponsors were just giving away\nT-shirts, stickers and other stuff. There were snacks and Kohsuke was\ncutting the extremely tasty 15 years of Jenkins cake. After having the\ncake, I went on a swag-collecting spree going from one sponsor booth to\nthe other. This was an amazing experience, not only was I able to get\ncool stuff, I was also able to learn a lot about the software these\ncompanies made and how it fits into the DevOps pipeline.\n\nAfter the conference got over, me, Long and Parichay went to the Lisbon\nMariott Hotel for the Eurodog party. After collecting another T-shirt, I\nwent to the nearest restaurant (McDonald’s) with Andrey who I had\nearlier met at the Hackfest.\n\nDay 3: December 4\n\nThis was the first official day of the conference and it began with the\nkeynote. There were over 900 people in the keynote hall. It was amazing\nto see so many people attending the conference. After the keynote got\nover, I went to several sessions throughout the day learning about how\ncompanies are using Jenkins and implementing DevOps tools.\n\nIn the evening, we had the Sonatype Superparty which was a lot of fun.\nThere were neon lights, arcade machines, VR experiences, superheroes and\nmore swag. There was a lot of good food including pizzas and burgers and\nhot dogs. Superhero inspired desserts were very interesting. I was able\nto talk to Oleg and Wadek about the security challenges in Jenkins.\nDuring the party, I also got a chance to meet the CEO of CloudBees,\nSacha Labourey.\n\nDay 4, December 5\n\nThis was the last day of the conference and it began with another\nkeynote. After the keynote, I attended a very interesting talk on how\nthe European Observatory built software for large telescopes using\nJenkins. After that, I prepared for my talk on the work I did during\nGoogle Summer of Code 2019. I had my presentation in the community booth\nduring the lunch time. Presenting in front of real people was an amazing\nexperience and very different from the ones we had on Zoom chats for our\nGSoC evaluations. In the evening, I got another chance to present my\nproject at the Jenkins Community Lightning Talks.\n\nAfter that, the conference came to an end and I went back to the hotel.\nAfter relaxing for some time, me, Parichay and Long were invited by Oleg\nto a dinner at Corinthia Hotel with Kohsuke, Mark and his wife, Tracy,\nAlyssa, and Liam. Unfortunately, Long couldn’t attend the dinner because\nhe had the flight back earlier that evening. After the amazing dinner, I\nthanked everyone for such an amazing trip and said goodbye.\n\nDWJW was the best experience I’ve ever had. I was able to learn about a\nlot of new things and talk to some amazing people. In the end, I would\nlike to especially thank Oleg for helping me throughout and making it\npossible for me to attend such a wonderful conference. I would like to\nthank my other mentors Runze Xia and Supun for their support in my\nGoogle Summer of Code project. I would like to thank Google for\norganizing Google Summer of Code, everyone at Jenkins project for\nsponsoring my travel, and CloudBees for inviting me to the conference.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you all again soon!","title":"Trip to DevOps World | Jenkins

am happy to report that jep:222[] has landed in Jenkins weeklies,\nstarting in 2.217.\nThis improvement brings experimental WebSocket support to Jenkins,\navailable when connecting inbound agents or when running the CLI.\nThe WebSocket protocol allows bidirectional, streaming communication over an HTTP(S) port.\n\nWhile many users of Jenkins could benefit,\nimplementing this system was particularly important for CloudBees\nbecause of how CloudBees Core on modern cloud platforms\n(i.e., running on Kubernetes) configures networking.\nWhen an administrator wishes to connect an inbound (formerly known as “JNLP”) external agent to a Jenkins controller,\nsuch as a Windows virtual machine running outside the cluster and using the agent service wrapper,\nuntil now the only option was to use a special TCP port.\nThis port needed to be opened to external traffic using low-level network configuration.\nFor example, users of the nginx ingress controller\nwould need to proxy a separate external port for each Jenkins service in the cluster.\nThe instructions to do this are complex and hard to troubleshoot.\n\nUsing WebSocket, inbound agents can now be connected much more simply when a reverse proxy is present:\nif the HTTP(S) port is already serving traffic,\nmost proxies will allow WebSocket connections with no additional configuration.\nThe WebSocket mode can be enabled in agent configuration,\nand support for pod-based agents in the Kubernetes plugin is coming soon.\nYou will need an agent version 4.0 or later,\nwhich is bundled with Jenkins in the usual way (Docker images with this version are coming soon).\n\nAnother part of Jenkins that was troublesome for reverse proxy users was the CLI.\nBesides the SSH protocol on port 22, which again was a hassle to open from the outside,\nthe CLI already had the ability to use HTTP(S) transport.\nUnfortunately the trick used to implement that confused some proxies and was not very portable.\nJenkins 2.217 offers a new -webSocket CLI mode which should avoid these issues;\nagain you will need to download a new version of jenkins-cli.jar to use this mode.\n\nThe WebSocket code has been tested against a sample of Kubernetes implementations (including OpenShift),\nbut it is likely that some bugs and limitations remain,\nand scalability of agents under heavy build loads has not yet been tested.\nTreat this feature as beta quality for now and let us know how it works!","title":"WebSocket","tags":["core","remoting","agents","cli"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"jglick","html":"<div

Summer of Code is much more than a summer internship program, it is a year-round effort for the organization and some community members.\nNow, after the DevOps World | Jenkins World conference in Lisbon and final retrospective meetings, we can say that GSoC 2019 is officially over.\nWe would like to start by thanking all participants: students, mentors, subject matter experts and all other contributors who proposed project ideas, participated in student selection, in community bonding and in further discussions and reviews.\nGoogle Summer of Code is a major effort which would not be possible without the active participation of the Jenkins community.\n\nIn this blogpost we would like to share the results and our experience from the previous year.\n\nResults\n\nFive GSoC projects were successfully completed this year:\nRole Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements,\nPlugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library,\nWorking Hours Plugin - UI Improvements,\nRemoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features,\nMulti-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM.\nWe will talk about the projects a little later in the document.\n\nProject details\n\nWe held the final presentations as Jenkins Online Meetups in late August and Google published the results on Sept 3rd.\nThe final presentations can be found here:\nPart 1,\nPart 2,\nPart 3.\nWe also presented the\n2019 Jenkins GSoC report\nat the DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco\nand at the\nDevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Lisbon conferences.\n\nIn the following sections, we present a brief summary of each project, links to the coding phase 3 presentations, and to the final products.\n\nRole Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements\n\nRole Strategy Plugin is one of the most widely used authorization plugins for Jenkins,\nbut it has never been famous for performance due to architecture issues and regular expression checks for project roles.\nAbhyudaya Sharma was working on this project together with hist mentors:\nOleg Nenashev, Runze Xia and Supun Wanniarachchi.\nHe started the project from creating a new Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins based on JMH,\ncreated benchmarks and achieved a 3501% improvement on some real-world scenarios.\nThen he went further and created a new Folder-based Authorization Strategy Plugin which offers even better performance for Jenkins instances where permissions are scoped to folders.\nDuring his project Abhyudaya also fixed the Jenkins Configuration-as-Code support in Role Strategy and contributed several improvements and fixes to the JCasC Plugin itself.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins,\nIntroducing new Folder Authorization Plugin, Performance Improvements to Role Strategy Plugin\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nSource code: Role Strategy Plugin, Folder Authorization Plugin\n\nPlugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library\n\nNatasha Stopa was working on a new CLI tool for plugin management,\nwhich should unify features available in other tools like install-plugins.sh in Docker images.\nIt also introduced many new features like YAML configuration format support, listing of available updates and security fixes.\nThe newly created tool should eventually replace the previous ones.\nNatasha’s mentors: Kristin Whetstone, Jon Brohauge and Arnab Banerjee.\nAlso, many contributors from Platform SIG and JCasC plugin team joined the project as a key stakeholders and subject-matter experts.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: alpha release announcement,\ncoding phase 2 updates\n\nFinal evaluation: slides,\nvideo\n\nSource code: Plugin installation manager tool\n\nWorking Hours Plugin - UI Improvements\n\nJenkins UI and frontend framework are a common topic in the Jenkins project,\nespecially in recent months after the new UX SIG was established.\nJack Shen was working on exploring new ways to build Jenkins Web UI together with his mentor Jeff Pearce.\nJack updated the Working Hours Plugin to use UI controls provided by standard React libraries.\nThen he documented his experienced and created template for plugins with React-based UI.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: Updates on Working Hours Plugin UI,\nReact Plugin Template\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nSource code: Working Hours Plugin, Template for Jenkins plugins with React-based UI\n\nRemoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features\n\nLong Le Vu Nguyen was working on extended Kubernetes support in the Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin.\nHis mentors were Andrey Falco and Pham vu Tuan who was our GSoC 2018 student and the plugin creator.\nDuring this project Long has added a new agent launcher which provisions Jenkins agents in Kubernetes and connects them to the controller.\nHe also created a Cloud API implementation for it and a new Helm chart which can provision Jenkins as entire system in Kubernetes,\nwith Apache Kafka enabled by default.\nAll these features were released in Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog post for [Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nPlugin source code\n\nMulti-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM\n\nParichay Barpanda was working on the new GitLab Branch Source Plugin with Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs and Folder Organisation support.\nHis mentors were\nMarky Jackson-Taulia,\nJustin Harringa,\nZhao Xiaojie and\nJoseph Petersen.\nThe plugin scans the projects, importing the pipeline jobs it identifies based on the criteria provided.\nAfter a project is imported, Jenkins immediately runs the jobs based on the Jenkinsfile pipeline script and notifies the status to GitLab Pipeline Status.\nThis plugin also provides GitLab server configuration which can be configured in Configure System or via Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC).\nread more about this project in the GitLab Branch Source 1.0 announcement.\n\nProject page\n\nCoding phase 3 presentation\n\nGitlab Branch Source Plugin, Gitlab API plugin\n\nProjects which were not completed\n\nNot all projects have been completed this year.\nWe were also working on Artifact Promotion plugin for Jenkins Pipeline\nand on Cloud Features for External Workspace Manager Plugin,\nbut unfortunately both projects were stopped after coding phase 1.\nAnyway, we got a lot of experience and takeaways in these areas (see linked Jira tickets!.\nWe hope that these stories will be implemented by Jenkins contributors at some point.\nGoogle Summer of Code 2020 maybe?\n\nRunning the GSoC program at our organization level\n\nHere are some of the things our organization did before and during GSoC behind the scenes.\nTo prepare for the influx of students, we updated all our GSoC pages and wrote down all the knowledge we accumulated over the years of running the program.\nWe started preparing in October 2018, long before the official start of the program.\nThe main objective was to address the feedback we got during GSoC 2018 retrospectives.\n\nProject ideas.\nWe started gathering project ideas in the last months of 2018.\nWe prepared a list of project ideas in a Google doc, and we tracked ownership of each project in a table of that document.\nEach project idea was further elaborated in its own Google doc.\nWe find that when projects get complicated during the definition phase, perhaps they are really too complicated and should not be done.\n\nSince we wanted all the project ideas to be documented the same way, we created a template to guide the contributors.\nMost of the project idea documents were written by org admins or mentors, but occasionally a student proposed a genuine idea.\nWe also captured contact information in that document such as GitHub and Gitter handles, and a preliminary list of potential mentors for the project.\nWe embedded all the project documents on our website.\n\nMentor and student guidelines.\nWe updated the mentor information page with details on what we expect mentors to do during the program,\nincluding the number of hours that are expected from mentors,\nand we even have a section on preventing conflict of interest.\nWhen we recruit mentors, we point them to the mentor information page.\n\nWe also updated the student information page.\nWe find this is a huge time saver as every student contacting us has the same questions about joining and participating in the program.\nInstead of re-explaining the program each time, we send them a link to those pages.\n\nApplication phase.\nStudents started to reach out very early on as well, many weeks before GSoC officially started.\nThis was very motivating.\nSome students even started to work on project ideas before the official start of the program.\n\nProject selection. This year the org admin team had some very difficult decisions to make.\nWith lots of students, lots of projects and lots of mentors, we had to request the right number of slots and try to match the projects with the most chances of success.\nWe were trying to form mentor teams at the same time as we were requesting the number of slots, and it was hard to get responses from all mentors in time for the deadline.\nFinally we requested fewer slots than we could have filled.\nWhen we request slots, we submit two numbers: a minimum and a maximum. The GSoC guide states that:\n\nThe minimum is based on the projects that are so amazing they really want to see these projects occur over the summer,\n\nand the maximum number should be the number of solid and amazing projects they wish to mentor over the summer.\n\nWe were awarded minimum. So we had to make very hard decisions: we had to decide between \"amazing\" and \"solid\" proposals.\nFor some proposals, the very outstanding ones, it’s easy.\nBut for the others, it’s hard.\nWe know we cannot make the perfect decision, and by experience, we know that some students or some mentors will not be able to complete the program due to uncontrollable life events, even for the outstanding proposals.\nSo we have to make the best decision knowing that some of our choices won’t complete the program.\n\nCommunity Bonding.\nWe have found that the community bonding phase was crucial to the success of each project.\nUsually projects that don’t do well during community bonding have difficulties later on.\nIn order to get students involved in the community better, almost all projects were handled under the umbrella of Special Interest Groups so that there were more stakeholders and communications.\n\nCommunications.\nEvery year we have students who contact mentors via personal messages.\nStudents, if you are reading this, please do NOT send us personal messages about the projects, you will not receive any preferential treatment.\nObviously, in open source we want all discussions to be public, so students have to be reminded of that regularly.\nIn 2019 we are using Gitter chat for most communications, but from an admin point of view this is more fragmented than mailing lists.\nIt is also harder to search.\nChat rooms are very convenient because they are focused, but from an admin point of view, the lack of threads in Gitter makes it hard to get an overview.\nGitter threads were added recently (Nov 2019) but do not yet work well on Android and iOS.\nWe adopted Zoom Meetings towards the end of the program and we are finding it easier to work with than Google Hangouts.\n\nStatus tracking.\nAnother thing that was hard was to get an overview of how all the projects were doing once they were running.\nWe made extensive use of Google sheets to track lists of projects and participants during the program\nto rank projects and to track statuses of project phases (community bonding, coding, etc.).\nIt is a challenge to keep these sheets up to date, as each project involves several people and several links.\nWe have found it time consuming and a bit hard to keep these sheets up to date, accurate and complete, especially up until the start of the coding phase.\n\nPerhaps some kind of objective tracking tool would help.\nWe used Jenkins Jira for tracking projects, with each phase representing a separate sprint.\nIt helped a lot for successful projects.\nIn our organization, we try to get everyone to beat the deadlines by a couple of days, because we know that there might be events such as power outages,\nbad weather (happens even in Seattle!), or other uncontrolled interruptions, that might interfere with submitting project data.\nWe also know that when deadlines coincide with weekends, there is a risk that people may forget.\n\nRetrospective.\nAt the end of our project, we also held a retrospective and captured some ideas for the future.\nYou can find the notes here.\nWe already addressed the most important comments in our documentation and project ideas for the next year.\n\nRecognition\n\nLast year, we wanted to thank everyone who participated in the program by sending swag.\nThis year, we collected all the mailing addresses we could and sent to everyone we could the 15-year Jenkins special edition T-shirt, and some stickers.\nThis was a great feel good moment.\nI want to personally thank Alyssa Tong her help on setting aside the t-shirt and stickers.\n\nMentor summit\n\nEach year Google invites two or more mentors from each organization to the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit.\nAt this event, hundreds of open-source project maintainers and mentors meet together and have unconference sessions targeting GSoC, community management and various tools.\nThis year the summit was held in Munich,\nand we sent Marky Jackson and Oleg Nenashev as representatives there.\n\nApart from discussing projects and sharing chocolate, we also presented Jenkins there, conducted a lightning talk and hosted the unconference session about automation bots for GitHub.\nWe did not make a team photo there, so try to find Oleg and Marky on this photo:\n\nGSoC Team at DevOps World | Jenkins World\n\nWe traditionally use GSoC organization payments and travel grants to sponsor student trips to major Jenkins-related events.\nThis year four students traveled to the DevOps World | Jenkins World conferences in San-Francisco and Lisbon.\nStudents presented their projects at the community booth and at the contributor summits,\nand their presentations got a lot of traction in the community!\n\nThanks a lot to Google and CloudBees who made these trips possible.\nYou can find a travel report from Natasha Stopa here,\nmore travel reports are coming soon.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis year, five projects were successfully completed.\nWe find this to be normal and in line with what we hear from other participating organizations.\n\nTaking the time early to update our GSoC pages saved us a lot of time later because we did not have to repeat all the information every time someone contacted us.\nWe find that keeping track of all the mentors, the students, the projects, and the meta information is a necessary but time consuming task.\nWe wish we had a tool to help us do that.\nCoordinating meetings and reminding participants of what needs to be accomplished for deadlines is part of the cheerleading aspect of GSoC, we need to keep doing this.\n\nLastly, I want to thank again all participants, we could not do this without you.\nEach year we are impressed by the students who do great work and bring great contributions to the Jenkins community.\n\nGSoC 2020?\n\nYes, there will be Google Summer of Code 2020!\nWe plan to participate, and we are looking for project ideas, mentors and students.\nJenkins GSoC pages have been already updated towards the next year, and we invite everybody interested to join us next year!\n\nMain page with all contacts\n\nGSoC 2020 Project

Previously, I was named the Most Valuable Jenkins Advocate.\nFinally, I was previously a mentoring lead within the Kubernetes project as well as a previous Kubernetes Outreachy coordinator for the Kubernetes project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>You can find me on Twitter @markyjackson5\nIn January 2021, I decided to step back from open-source projects for the foreseeable future and focus on mental health, family, work and graduate school.</p>\n</div>","id":"markyjackson-taulia","irc":"markyjackson_","linkedin":"markyjackson5","name":"Marky Jackson","slug":"/blog/author/markyjackson-taulia","twitter":"markyjackson5"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b56c3926-16c3-522f-ae8f-4b714de4beff","slug":"/blog/2020/01/23/a-new-chapter-for-kohsuke/","strippedHtml":"2020 is going to be a year of change for me.\nBy the end of January, I’ll be officially stepping back from Jenkins,\nswitching my role at CloudBees to an advisor,\nand turning attention to my new startup.\nThe rest of this post is to contextualize this transition, because if you haven’t been working closely with me, this might come across as a surprise.\n\nJenkins has been an amazing journey that never stopped giving.\nI have loved it all - especially meeting the users around the world who made Jenkins what it is today.\nAs the creator of the project, at some point I started wondering how to pass the torch to the next leaders, how to get people to step up and drive it forward.\nToday, thanks to CloudBees and the community, there is a new generation of talented and capable leaders who are passionately driving things forward - and it’s been great to see.\nNewly elected board members, Jenkins X folks, just to name a few.\nThese new people bring new culture and new code, and altogether it has created a positive jolt that pushed Jenkins out of a local optimum I talked about.\nThey have all my support and respect.\nIn reality, my involvement with Jenkins lately has already been largely symbolic, a little bit like an emperor of Japan or a queen of the UK.\nThat’s why this announcement has little practical impact on the forward motion of Jenkins.\n\nSeveral years ago, I used to feel like the sky would fall down if I stepped aside.\nSomewhere in 2019, I suddenly noticed that I wasn’t feeling like that at all anymore.\nThe shift was gradual and steady, so I’m not sure exactly when I crossed the threshold, but in 2019 it was clear I was on the other side.\nThat’s how I knew I could finally end this chapter of my life.\n15 years with Jenkins and 9 years with CloudBees.\nThat is a long time.\n\nI hope you will be wondering what is my new chapter.\nI’m launching a new startup, Launchable, with my old time buddy Harpreet Singh.\nI have known him since my days at Sun Microsystems and JavaEE, and he was my partner in crime at CloudBees to build the Jenkins business from scratch.\nHe went to Atlassian running its BitBucket business for a while, but now he and I are back sitting side by side again.\nA number of CloudBees people invested, including Sacha Labourey,\nBob Bickel,\nand John Vrionis.\n\nThrough Jenkins and CloudBees, I was able to push the state of automation forward in software development.\nSuch automation is producing a lot of data, but we are not using that data to improve our lives.\nIt truly is a wasted gold mine.\nLaunchable is working on harnessing that information to improve developer productivity.\nI wrote a separate blog post to discuss more about my thinking.\n\nLastly, even though I’m moving on from CloudBees as a full-time employee, I’m not completely going away.\nI’ll be still in the CloudBees orbit, as an advisor.\nI’m still very much invested both emotionally and financially in CloudBees.\nI’m still a big fan, and I’ll continue to cheer for them, but from the sideline.\nThe same with Jenkins.\nI’m still on the governance board, ensuring the continuity.\nI’m also still on the Technical Oversight Committee of the Continuous Delivery Foundation,\nthough my chairperson term will expire in March.\n\nI’m incredibly grateful for the undeserved opportunity and the privilege given to me during this chapter.\nI was surrounded by wonderful, inspiring, and talented people, from whom I learned a lot.\nI can only hope that I was able to make a positive impact, and give something back in return to them.\nI won’t name names, but you know who you are, and we’ll stay in touch.\n\nThis year is going to be truly exciting for me.

There will be no user-focused topics (no presentations, no trainings, etc.) but we will focus on defining key priorities for the project, building a roadmap and resolving issues we have in the project at the moment.\nWe’ll end up the day with our now traditional Orval and flemish beef stew at Le Roy d’Espagne\n\nFinally the FOSDEM, the 01 and 02 of February, we’ll all be at FOSDEM.
