Show your Jenkins pride. Get our T-shirt\n\nBe an inspiration to the Jenkins community by sharing your Jenkins story.\nJust go to this link and fill out the form.\nWe’ll ask you about your project’s goals, the technical challenges you overcame with Jenkins, and the solutions you created.\nIt should take no more than 20-30 minutes to complete.\n\nWe’ll clean it up for clarity and publish it on https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io.\n\nOnce it’s part of our archive, we’ll send you our new 2020 Jenkins Is the Way t-shirt.\n\nAnd since the more, the merrier, please share this blog post with peers and colleagues.\nWe want to hear everyone’s stories about the clever ways Jenkins is used to automate all that we need to do.\n\nThanks and Acknowledgement\n\nSpecial thanks to abConsulting for creating and managing the https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io site and for reviewing, editing, and publishing the submitted stories.\n\nThanks to the Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG for their reviews and feedback.\n\nThanks also to CloudBees for sponsoring the \" Jenkins is the Way\" program.","title":"Call for User Stories - Jenkins is the Way","tags":["announcement","outreach-programs","advocacy-and-outreach","jenkins-is-the-way"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/8d248/alyssat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/c004c/alyssat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/9e67b/alyssat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/22924/alyssat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/89767/alyssat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/40d97/alyssat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/5028e/alyssat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":166}}},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp;

No more need for 'bot' users or figuring out who should be the owner of 2FA or OAuth tokens.\n\nImproved security and tighter permissions - GitHub Apps offer much finer-grained permissions compared to a service user and its personal access tokens. This lets the Jenkins GitHub app require a much smaller set of privileges to run properly.\n\nAccess to GitHub Checks API - GitHub Apps can access the the GitHub Checks API to create check runs and check suites from Jenkins jobs and provide detailed feedback on commits as well as code annotation\n\nGetting started\n\nInstall the GitHub Branch Source plugin,\nmake sure the version is 2.7.1 or above.\n\nConfiguring the GitHub Organization Folder\n\nFollow the GitHub App Authentication setup guide.  These instructions are also linked from the plugin’s README on GitHub.\n\nOnce you’ve finished setting it up, Jenkins will validate your credential and you should see your new rate limit.\nHere’s an example on a large org:\n\nHow do I get an API token in my pipeline?\n\nIn addition to usage of GitHub App authentication for Multi-Branch Pipeline, you can also use app authentication directly in your Pipelines.\nYou can access the Bearer token for the GitHub API by just loading a 'Username/Password' credential as usual,\nthe plugin will handle authenticating with GitHub in the background.\n\nThis could be used to call additional GitHub API endpoints from your pipeline, possibly the\ndeployments api or you may wish to implement your own\nchecks api integration until Jenkins supports this out of the box.\n\nNote: the API token you get will only be valid for one hour, don’t get it at the start of the pipeline and assume it will be valid all the way through\n\nExample: Let’s submit a check run to Jenkins from our Pipeline:\n\npipeline {\n  agent any\n\n  stages{\n    stage('Check run') {\n      steps {\n        withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'githubapp-jenkins',\n                                          usernameVariable: 'GITHUB_APP',\n                                          passwordVariable: 'GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN')]) {\n            sh '''\n            curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n                 -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github.antiope-preview+json\" \\\n                 -H \"authorization: Bearer ${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}\" \\\n                 -d '{ \"name\": \"check_run\", \\\n                       \"head_sha\": \"'${GIT_COMMIT}'\", \\\n                       \"status\": \"in_progress\", \\\n                       \"external_id\": \"42\", \\\n                       \"started_at\": \"2020-03-05T11:14:52Z\", \\\n                       \"output\": { \"title\": \"Check run from Jenkins!\", \\\n                                   \"summary\": \"This is a check run which has been generated from Jenkins as GitHub App\", \\\n                                   \"text\": \"...and that is awesome\"}}' https://api.github.com/repos/ / /check-runs\n            '''\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhat’s next\n\nGitHub Apps authentication in Jenkins is a huge improvement.  Many teams have already started using it and have helped improve it by giving pre-release feedback. There are more improvements on the way.\n\nThere’s a proposed Google Summer of Code project: GitHub Checks API for Jenkins Plugins.\nIt will look at integrating with the Checks API,\nwith a focus on reporting issues found using the warnings-ng plugin\ndirectly onto the GitHub pull requests, along with test results summary on GitHub.\nHopefully it will make the Pipeline example below much simpler for Jenkins users :)\nIf you want to get involved with this, join the GSoC Gitter channel\nand ask how you can help.","title":"GitHub App authentication support released","tags":["github","github-branch-source","pipeline","announcement"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"timja","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer, along with slack, azure-keyvault and configuration-as-code plugins.\nTim started using Jenkins in 2013 and became an active contributor in 2018.\nTim enjoys working on open source software in his “free” time.</p>\n</div>","id":"timja","irc":null,"linkedin":"tim-jacomb-98043174","name":"Tim Jacomb","slug":"/blog/authors/timja","twitter":"Tjaynz"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","id":"479ec095-b427-5e47-95a5-1bca6fbc97c5","slug":"/blog/2020/03/30/azure-key-vault-cred-provider/","strippedHtml":"Azure Key Vault is a product for securely managing keys, secrets and certificates.\n\nI’m happy to announce two new features in the Azure Key Vault plugin:\n\na credential provider to tightly link Jenkins and Azure Key Vault.\n\nhuge thanks to Jie Shen for contributing this\n\nintegration with the configuration-as-code plugin.\n\nThese changes were released in v1.8 but make sure to run the latest version of the plugin, there has been some fixes since then.\n\nSome advantages of using the credential provider rather than your own scripts:\n\nyour Jenkins jobs consume the credentials with no knowledge of Azure Key Vault, so they stay vendor-independent.\n\nthe provider integrates with the ecosystem of existing Jenkins credential consumers, such as the Slack Notifications plugin.\n\ncredential usage is recorded in the central Jenkins credentials tracking log.\n\nJenkins can use multiple credentials providers concurrently, so you can incrementally migrate credentials to Azure Key Vault while consuming other credentials from your existing providers.\n\nNote: Currently only secret text credentials are supported via the credential provider, you can use the configuration-as-code integration to load the secret from Azure Key Vault into the System Credential Provider to work around this limitation.\n\nGetting started\n\nInstall the Azure Key Vault plugin\n\nThen you will need to configure the plugin.\n\nAzure authentication\n\nThere’s two types of authentication you can use 'Microsoft Azure Service Principal' or 'Managed Identities for Azure Resources'\n\nThe easiest one to set this up quickly with is the 'Microsoft Azure Service Principal',\n\n$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name http://service-principal-name\nCreating a role assignment under the scope of \"/subscriptions/ff251390-d7c3-4d2f-8352-f9c6f0cc8f3b\"\n  Retrying role assignment creation: 1/36\n  Retrying role assignment creation: 2/36\n{\n  \"appId\": \"021b5050-9177-4268-a300-7880f2beede3\",\n  \"displayName\": \"service-principal-name\",\n  \"name\": \"http://service-principal-name\",\n  \"password\": \"d9d0d1ba-d16f-4e85-9b48-81ea45a46448\",\n  \"tenant\": \"7e593e3e-9a1e-4c3d-a26a-b5f71de28463\"\n}\n\nIf this doesn’t work then take a look at the Microsoft documentation for creating a service principal.\n\nNote: for production 'Managed Identities for Azure Resources' is more secure as there’s no password involved and you don’t need to worry about the service principal’s password or certificate expiring.\n\nVault setup\n\nYou need to create a vault and give your service principal access to it:\n\nRESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=my-resource-group\naz group create --location uksouth --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME\n\nVAULT=my-vault #

Writing such a file should be easy without being a Jenkins expert.\n\nFor many secrets the credential provider is enough,\nbut when integrating with other plugins you will likely need more than string credentials.\n\nYou can use the configuration-as-code plugin (aka JCasC) to allow integrating with other credential types.\n\nconfigure authentication\n\nAs the JCasC plugin runs during initial startup the Azure Key Vault credential provider needs to be configured before JCasC runs during startup.\n\nThe easiest way to do that is via environment variables set before Jenkins starts up:\n\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_URL=https://my.vault.azure.net\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_CLIENT_ID=...\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_CLIENT_SECRET=...\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=...\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=...\n\nSee the azure-keyvault documentation for other authentication options.\n\nYou will now be able to refer to Azure Key Vault secret IDs in your jenkins.yaml file:\n\ncredentials:\n  system:\n    domainCredentials:\n      - credentials:\n        - usernamePassword:\n            description: \"GitHub\"\n            id: \"jenkins-github\"\n            password: \"${jenkins-github-apikey}\"\n            scope: GLOBAL\n            username: \"jenkinsadmin\"\n\nThanks for reading, send feedback on twitter using the tweet button in the top right, any issues or feature requests use GitHub issues.","title":"Introducing the Azure Key Vault Credentials Provider for Jenkins","tags":["jenkins","pipeline","security","azure","credentials","credential-provider","configuration-as-code"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"timja","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer, along with slack, azure-keyvault and configuration-as-code plugins.\nTim started using Jenkins in 2013 and became an active contributor in 2018.\nTim enjoys working on open source software in his “free” time.</p>\n</div>","id":"timja","irc":null,"linkedin":"tim-jacomb-98043174","name":"Tim Jacomb","slug":"/blog/authors/timja","twitter":"Tjaynz"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d79e4a42-13d6-5155-8cc3-c8c31c9738ff","slug":"/blog/2020/03/17/ui-plugins/","strippedHtml":"This article has been presented in an recorded online session\nduring the Jenkins 2020 UI/UX Hackfest.\n\nFor Jenkins a large number of plugins are available that visualize the results of a wide variety of build steps. There\nare plugins available to render the test results, the code coverage, the static analysis and so on. All of these plugins\ntypically pick up the build results of a given build step and show them in the user interface. In order to render these\ndetails most of the plugins use static HTML pages, since this type of user interface is the standard visualization in\nJenkins since its inception in 2007.\n\nIn order to improve the look and feel and the user experience of these plugins it makes sense to move forward and\nincorporate some modern Java Script libraries and components. Since development of Blue Ocean has been stopped (see\nJenkins mailing list post)\nplugin authors need to decide on their own, which UI technologies are helpful for that task. However, the universe of\nmodern UI components is so overwhelming that it makes sense to pick up only a small set of components that are proven\nto be useful and compatible with Jenkins underlying web technologies. Moreover, the initial setup of\nincorporating such a new component is quite large so it would be helpful if that work needs to be done only once.\n\nThis guide introduces a few UI components\nthat make sense to be used by all plugin authors in the future to provide a rich user interface for reports in Jenkins.\nIn order to simplify the usage of these libraries in the context of Jenkins as a Java based web application, these\nJava Script libraries and components have been packaged as ordinary Jenkins plugins.\n\nIn the following sections, these new components will be introduced step by step. In order to see how these components\ncan be used a plugin, I demonstrate the new features while enhancing the existing\nForensics Plugin with a new user\ninterface. Since the Warnings Next Generation Plugin also uses these new components, you can see additional examples\nin the documentation of the warnings plugin\nor in our public ci.jenkins.io instance, that\nalready is using these components in the detail views of the warnings plugin.\n\n1. New user interface plugins\n\nThe following UI components are provided as new Jenkins plugins:\n\njquery3-api-plugin :\nProvides jQuery 3 for Jenkins Plugins.\njQuery is — as described on their home page — a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things\nlike HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API\nthat works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the\nway that millions of people write JavaScript.\n\nbootstrap4-api-plugin :\nProvides Bootstrap 4 for Jenkins Plugins. Bootstrap is — according to their self-perception — the world’s most popular front-end component library to build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. It is\nan open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Developers can quickly prototype their ideas or\nbuild entire apps with their Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins\nbuilt on jQuery.\n\ndata-tables-api-plugin :\nProvides DataTables for Jenkins Plugins.\nDataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library. It is a highly flexible tool, built upon the foundations\nof progressive enhancement, that adds all of these advanced features to any HTML table:\n\nPrevious, next and page navigation\n\nFilter results by text search\n\nSort data by multiple columns at once\n\nDOM, Javascript, Ajax and server-side processing\n\nEasily theme-able\n\nMobile friendly\n\necharts-api-plugin :\nProvides ECharts for Jenkins Plugins. ECharts is an open-sourced\nJavaScript visualization tool to create intuitive, interactive, and highly-customizable charts. It\ncan run fluently on PC and mobile devices and it is compatible with most modern\nWeb Browsers.\n\nfont-awesome-api-plugin :\nProvides Font Awesome for Jenkins Plugins. Font Awesome has vector icons and social logos,\naccording to their self-perception it is the web’s most popular icon set and toolkit. Currently, it contains more than\n1,500 free icons.\n\npopper-api-plugin\nProvides Popper.js for Jenkins Plugins. Popper can\neasily position tooltips, popovers or anything else with just a line of code.\n\nplugin-util-api-plugin : This small plugin provides\nsome helper and base classes to simplify the creation of reporters in Jenkins. This plugin also\nprovides a set of architecture rules that can be included in an architecture test suite of your plugin.\n\n2. Required changes for a plugin POM\n\nIn order to use these plugins you need to add them as dependencies in your plugin pom. You can use the following snippet\nto add them all:\n\npom.xml\n\n[...]\n\n1.0.2\n5.12.0-7\n4.4.1-10\n4.6.0-8\n1.10.20-13\n[...]\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\nplugin-util-api\n${plugin-util-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\nfont-awesome-api\n${font-awesome-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\nbootstrap4-api\n${bootstrap4-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\necharts-api\n${echarts-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\ndata-tables-api\n${data-tables-api.version}\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\nAlternatively, you have a look at the POM files of the\nWarnings Next Generation Plugin or the\nForensics API Plugin which already use these\nplugins.\n\n3. General structure of a reporter\n\nIn this section I will explain some fundamentals of the design of Jenkins, i.e. the Java model and the associated\nuser interface elements. If you are already familiar on how to implement the corresponding extension points of a\nreporter plugin (see section Extensibility in Jenkins'\ndeveloper guide), then you can skip this section and head directly to Section 3.1.\n\nJenkins organizes projects using the static object model structure shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Jenkins design - high level view of the Java model\n\nThe top level items in Jenkins user interface are jobs (at least the top level items\nwe are interested in). Jenkins contains several jobs of different types (Freestyle jobs, Maven Jobs, Pipelines, etc.).\n\nEach of these jobs contains an arbitrary number of builds (or more technically, runs). Each build is identified by its\nunique build number. Jenkins plugins can attach results to these builds, e.g. build artifacts, test results,\nanalysis reports, etc. In order to attach such a result, a plugin technically needs to implement and create an action\nthat stores these results.\n\nThese Java objects are visualized in several different views, which are described in more detail in the following\nsections. The top-level view that shows all available Jobs is shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Jenkins view showing all available jobs\n\nPlugins can also contribute UI elements in these views, but this is out of scope of this guide.\n\nEach job has a detail view, where plugins can extend corresponding extension points and provide summary boxes and\ntrend charts. Typically, summary boxes for reporters are not required on the job level, so I describe only trend charts\nin more detail, see section Section 5.5.2.\n\nFigure 3. Jenkins view showing details about a job\n\nEach build has a detail view as well. Here plugins can provide summary boxes similar to the boxes for the job details\nview. Typically, plugins show here only a short summary and provide a link to detailed results, see Figure 4 for\nan example.\n\nFigure 4. Jenkins view showing details about a build\n\nThe last element in the view hierarchy actually is a dedicated view that shows the results of a specific plugin. E.g.,\nthere are views to show the test results, the analysis results, and so on. It is totally up to a given plugin what\nelements should be shown there. In the next few sections I will introduce some new UI components that can be used\nto show the corresponding results in a pleasant way.\n\n3.1. Extending Jenkins object model\n\nSince reporters typically are composed in a similar way, I extended Jenkins' original object model\n(see Figure 1) with some additional elements, so it will be much simpler to create or implement\na new reporter plugin. This new model is shown in Figure 5. The central element is a build action that\nwill store the results of a plugin reporter. This action will be attached to each build and will hold (and persist) the\nresults for a reporter. The detail data of each action will be automatically stored in an additional file, so the\nmemory footprint of Jenkins can be kept small if the details are never requested by users. Additionally, this\naction is also used to simplify the creation of project actions and trend charts, see Section 5.5.2.\n\nFigure 5. Jenkins reporter design - high level view of the model for reporter plugins\n\n4. Git Forensics plugin\n\nThe elements in this tutorial will be all used in the new\nForensics API Plugin (actually the plugin is not new, it is a dependency of the\nWarnings Next Generation Plugin). You can download the plugin content\nand see in more detail how these new components can be used in practice. Or you can change this plugin just to see\nhow these new components can be parametrized.\n\nIf you are using Git as source code management system then this plugin will mine\nthe repository in the style of\nCode as a Crime Scene\n(Adam Tornhill, November 2013) to determine statistics of the contained source code files:\n\ntotal number of commits\n\ntotal number of different authors\n\ncreation time\n\nlast modification time\n\nThe plugin provides a new step (or post build publisher) that starts the repository mining and stores\nthe collected information in a Jenkins action (see Figure 5). Afterwards you get a new\nbuild summary that shows the total number of scanned files (as trend and as build result). From\nhere you can navigate to the details view that shows the scanned files in a table that can be\nsimply sorted and filtered. You also will get some pie charts that show important aspects of the\ncommit history.\n\nPlease note that this functionality of the plugin still is a proof of concept: the performance of this step heavily\ndepends on the size and the number of commits of your Git repository. Currently it scans the whole repository in each\nbuild. In the near future I hope to find a volunteer who is interested in replacing this dumb algorithm with an incremental scanner.\n\n5. Introducing the new  UI components\n\nAs already mentioned in Section 3, a details view is plugin specific. What is shown and how these\nelements are presented is up to the individual plugin author. So in the next sections I provide some examples\nand new concepts that plugins can use as building blocks for their own content.\n\n5.1. Modern icons\n\nJenkins plugins typically do not use icons very frequently. Most plugins provide an icon for the actions and that’s it.\nIf you intend to use icons in other places, plugin authors are left on their own: the recommended Tango icon set is more\nthan 10 years old and too limited nowadays. There are several options available, but the most popular is the\nFont Awesome Icon Set. It provides more than 1500 free icons that follow the same\ndesign guidelines:\n\nFigure 6. Font Awesome icons in Jenkins plugins\n\nIn order to use Font Awesome icons in a plugin you simply need a dependency to the corresponding\nfont-awesome-api-plugin. Then you can use any of the solid icons\nby using the new tag svg-icon in your jelly view:\n\nindex.jelly\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\nIf you are generating views using Java code, then you also can use the class SvgTag to generate the\nHTML markup for such an icon.\n\n5.2. Grid layout\n\nJenkins currently includes in all views an old and patched version of Boostrap’s grid system (with 24 columns). This version\nis not compatible with Boostrap 4 or any of the JS libraries that depend on Bootstrap4. In order to use Bootstrap 4\nfeatures we need to replace the Jenkins provided layout.jelly file with a patched version, that does not load\nthe broken grid system. I’m planning to create a PR that fixes the grid in Jenkins core, but that will take some time.\nUntil then you will need to use the provided layout.jelly of the Boostrap4 plugin, see below.\n\nThe first thing to decide is, which elements should be shown on a plugin page and how much space each element\nshould occupy. Typically, all visible components are mapped on the available space using a simple grid.\nIn a Jenkins view we have a fixed header and footer and a navigation bar on the left\n(20 percent of the horizontal space). The rest of a screen can be used by\na details view. In order to simplify the distribution of elements in that remaining space we use\nBootstrap’s grid system.\n\nFigure 7. Jenkins layout with a details view that contains a grid system\n\nThat means, a view is split into 12 columns and and arbitrary number of rows. This grid system is simple to use\n(but complex enough to also support fancy screen layouts) - I won’t go into\ndetails here, please refer to the Bootstrap documentation\nfor details.\n\nFor the forensics detail view we use a simple grid of two rows and two columns. Since the number of columns always is 12\nwe need to create two \"fat\" columns that fill 6 of the standard columns.\nIn order to create such a view in our\nplugin we need to create a view given as a jelly file and a corresponding Java view model object. A view with this layout\nis shown in the following snippet:\n\nindex.jelly\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n(4)\n(5)\nContent of column 1 in row 1\n\n(6)\nContent of column 2 in row 1\n\n(7)\n(8)\nContent of row 2\n\n1\nUse a custom layout based on Bootstrap: since Jenkins core contains an old version of Bootstrap,\nwe need to replace the standard layout.jelly file.\n\n2\nImport Bootstrap 4: Importing of JS and CSS components is done using the adjunct concept,\nwhich is the preferred way of referencing static resources within Jenkins' Stapler Web framework.\n\n3\nThe whole view will be placed into a fluid container that fills up the whole screen (100% width).\n\n4\nA new row of the view is specified with class row. The additional class py-3 defines the padding to use for\nthis row, see Bootstrap Spacing for more details.\n\n5\nSince Bootstrap automatically splits up a row into 12 equal sized columns we define here\nthat the first column should occupy 6 of these 12 columns. You can also leave off the detailed numbers, then Bootstrap will\nautomatically distribute the content in the available space. Just be aware that this not what you want in most of the times.\n\n6\nThe second column uses the remaining space, i.e. 6 of the 12 columns.\n\n7\nThe second row uses the same layout as row 1.\n\n8\nThere is only one column for row 1, it will fill the whole available space.\n\nYou can also specify different column layouts for one row, based on the actual visible size of the screen.\nThis helps to improve the layout for larger screens. In the warnings plugin you will find\nan example: on small devices, there is one card visible that shows one pie chart in a carousel. If you are\nopening the same page on a larger device, then two of the pie charts are shown side by side and the carousel is hidden.\n\n5.3. Cards\n\nWhen presenting information of a plugin as a block, typically plain text elements are shown. This will normally result\nin some kind of boring web pages. In order to create a more appealing interface, it makes sense to present such information\nin a card, that has a border, a header, an icon, and so on. In order to create such a\nBootstrap card a small jelly tag has been provided by the new\nBootstrap plugin that simplifies this task for a plugin.\nSuch a card can be easily created in a jelly view in the following way:\n\nContent of the card\n\nIn Figure 8 examples of such cards are shown. The cards in the upper row contain pie charts that show the\ndistribution of the number of authors and commits in the whole repository. The card at the bottom shows the detail\ninformation in a DataTable. The visualization is not limited to charts or tables, you can\nshow any kind of HTML content in there. You can show any icon of your\nplugin in these cards, but it is recommended to use one of the existing Font Awesome icons\nto get a consistent look and feel in Jenkins' plugin ecosystem.\n\nFigure 8. Bootstraps cards in Jenkins plugins\n\nNote that the size of the cards is determined by the grid configuration, see Section 5.2.\n\n5.4. Tables\n\nA common UI element to show plugin details is a table control. Most plugins (and Jenkins core) typically use\nplain HTML tables. However, if the table should show a large number of rows then using a more sophisticated control\nlike DataTables makes more sense. Using this JS based table control provides additional\nfeatures at no cost:\n\nfilter results by text search\n\nprovide pagination of the result set\n\nsort data by multiple columns at once\n\nobtain table rows using Ajax calls\n\nshow and hide columns based on the screen resolution\n\nIn order to use DataTables in a view there are two options, you can either decorate existing\nstatic HTML tables (see Section 5.4.1) or populate the table content using Ajax (see Section 5.4.2).\n\n5.4.1. Tables with static HTML content\n\nThe easiest way of using DataTables is by creating a static HTML table that will be decorated by simply calling the\nconstructor of the datatable. This approach involves no special handling on the Java and Jelly side, so I think it is\nsufficient to follow the example in the DataTables\ndocumentation. Just make sure that after building the table in your Jelly file you need to decorate the table\nwith the following piece of code:\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\n1\nreplace id with the ID of your HTML table element\n\nIn the Forensics plugin no such static table is used so far, but you can have a look at the\ntable that shows fixed warnings\nin the warnings plugin to see how such a table can be decorated.\n\n5.4.2. Tables with dynamic model based content\n\nWhile static HTML tables are easy to implement, they have several limitations. So it makes sense to follow a more\nsophisticated approach. Typically, tables in user interfaces are defined by using a corresponding table (and row) model.\nJava Swing successfully provides such a\ntable model concept since the early days of Java.\nI adapted these concepts for Jenkins and DataTables as well. In order to create a table in a Jenkins view a plugin\nneeds to provide a table model class, that provides the following information:\n\nthe ID of the table (since there might be several tables in the view)\n\nthe model of the columns (i.e., the number, type, and header labels of the columns)\n\nthe content of the table (i.e. the individual row objects)\n\nYou will find an example of such a table in the Forensics plugin: here a table lists\nthe files in your Git repository combined with the corresponding commit statistics (number of authors,\nnumber of commits, last modification, first commit). A screenshot of that table is shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9. Dynamic Table in the Forensics plugin\n\nIn order to create such a table in Jenkins, you need to create a table model class that derives from TableModel.\nIn Figure 10 a diagram of the corresponding classes in the Forensics plugin is shown.\n\nFigure 10. Table model of the Forensics plugin\n\nTable column model\n\nThis first thing a table model class defines is a model of the available columns by creating corresponding\nTableColumn instances. For each column you need to specify a header label and the name of the bean property that\nshould be shown in the corresponding column (the row elements are actually Java beans: each column will\nshow one distinct property of such a bean, see next section). You can\nuse any of the supported column types by simply providing a\nString or Integer based column.\n\nTable rows content\n\nAdditionally, a table model class provides the content of the rows. This getRows() method\nwill be invoked asynchronously using an Ajax call. Typically, this method simply returns a list of Java Bean instances,\nthat provide the properties of each column (see previous section). These objects will be converted automatically\nto an array of JSON objects, the basic data structure required for the DataTables API.\nYou will find a fully working example table model\nimplementation in the Git repository of the forensics plugin in the class\nForensicsTableModel.\n\nIn order to use such a table in your plugin view you need to create the table in the associated\nJelly file using the new table tag:\n\nindex.jelly\n\n[...]\n\n(1)\n[...]\n\n1\nreplace id with the id of your table\n\nThe only parameter you need to provide for the table is the model — it is typically part of the corresponding\nJenkins view model class (this object is referenced with ${it} in the view).\nIn order to connect the corresponding Jenkins view model class with the table, the view model class needs to\nimplement the AsyncTableContentProvider interface. Or even simpler, let your view model class derive from\nDefaultAsyncTableContentProvider. This relationship is required, so that Jenkins can automatically create\nand bind a proxy for the Ajax calls that will automatically fill the table content after the HTML page has been created.\n\nIf we put all those pieces together, we are required to define a model similar to the model of the Forensics plugin,\nthat is shown in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11. Jenkins reporter design - high level view of the model for reporter plugins\n\nAs already described in Figure 5 the plugin needs to attach a BuildAction to each build. The\nForensics plugin attaches a ForensicBuildAction to the build. This action stores a RepositoryStatistics instance,\nthat contains the repository results for a given build. This action delegates all Stapler requests to a new\nstaplerdoc:org.kohsuke.stapler.StaplerProxy[Stapler proxy instance] so we can keep the\naction clean of user interface code. This ForensicsViewModel class then acts as view model that provides the server\nside model for the corresponding Jelly view given by the file index.jelly.\n\nWhile this approach looks quite complex at a first view, you will see that the actual implementation part\nis quite small. Most of the boilerplate code is already provided by the base classes and you need to implement\nonly a few methods. Using this concept also provides some additional features, that are part of the DataTables plugin:\n\nOrdering of columns is persisted automatically in the browser local storage.\n\nPaging size is persisted automatically in the browser local storage.\n\nThe Ajax calls are actually invoked only if a table will become visible. So if you have\nseveral tables hidden in tabs then the content will be loaded on demand only, reducing the amount of data\nto be transferred.\n\nThere is an option available to provide an additional details row that can be expanded with a + symbol,\nsee warnings plugin table for details.\n\n5.5. Charts\n\nA plugin reporter typically also reports some kind of trend from build to build. Up to now Jenkins core provides only a\nquite limited concept of rendering such trends as trend charts. The\nJFreeChart framework offered by Jenkins core is a server\nside rendering engine that creates charts as static PNG images that will be included on the job and details pages.\nNowadays, several powerful JS based charting libraries are available, that do the same job\n(well actually an even better job) on the client side. That has the advantage that these charts can be customized\non each client without affecting the server performance. Moreover, you get a lot of additional\nfeatures (like zooming, animation, etc.) for free. Additionally, these charting libraries not only support the typical\nbuild trend charts but also a lot of additional charts types that can be used to improve the user experience of\na plugin.\nOne of those charting libraries is ECharts : this library has a powerful API\nand supports literally every chart type one can image of. You can get some impressions of the features on the\nexamples page of the library.\n\nIn order to use these charts one can embed charts that use this library by importing the corresponding JS files and by\ndefining the chart in the corresponding Jelly file. While that already works quite well it\nwill be still somewhat cumbersome to provide the corresponding model for these charts from Jenkins build results. So\nI added a powerful Java API that helps to create the model for these charts on the Java side. This API provides the\nfollowing features:\n\nCreate trend charts based on a collection of build results.\n\nSeparate the chart type from the aggregation in order to simplify unit testing of the chart model.\n\nToggle the type of the X-Axis between build number or build date (with automatic aggregation of results that\nhave been recorded at the same day).\n\nAutomatic conversion of the Java model to the required JSON model for the JS side.\n\nSupport for pie and line charts (more to come soon).\n\nThose charts can be used as trend chart in the project page (see Figure 3) or as information chart in the details\nview of a plugin (see Section 5).\n\n5.5.1. Pie charts\n\nA simple but still informative chart is a pie chart that illustrates numerical proportions of plugin data. In the Forensics\nplugin I am using this chart to show the numerical proportions of the number of authors or commits for the\nsource code files in the Git repository (see Figure 8). In the warnings plugin I use this chart to show the\nnumerical proportions of the new, outstanding, or fixed warnings, see Figure 12.\n\nFigure 12. Pie chart in the Warnings plugin\n\nIn order to include such a chart in your details view, you can use the provided pie-chart tag.\nIn the following snippet you see this tag in action (embedded in a Bootstrap card, see Section 5.3):\n\nindex.jelly\n\n[...]\n<c:pie-chart id=\"authors\" model=\"${it.authorsModel}\" height=\"256\" />\n\n[...]\n\nYou need to provide a unique ID for this chart and the corresponding model value. The model must be the JSON\nrepresentation of a corresponding PieChartModel instance. Such a model can be created with a couple of lines:\n\nViewModel.java\n\n[...]\n    PieChartModel model = new PieChartModel(\"Title\");\n\n    model.add(new PieData(\"Segment 1 name\", 10), Palette.RED);\n    model.add(new PieData(\"Segment 2 name\", 15), Palette.GREEN);\n    model.add(new PieData(\"Segment 3 name\", 20), Palette.YELLOW);\n\n    String json = new JacksonFacade().toJson(model);\n    [...]\n\n5.5.2. Trend charts on the job level view\n\nIn order to show a trend that renders a line chart on the job page (see Figure 3) you need to provide a so called\nfloating box (stored in the file floatingBox.jelly of your job action (see Section 3)).\nThe content of this file is quite simple and contains just a trend-chart tag:\n\nfloatingBox.jelly\n\n<c:trend-chart it=\"${from}\" title=\"${%SCM Files Count Trend}\" enableLinks=\"true\"/>\n\nOn the Java side the model for the chart needs to be provided in the corresponding sub class of JobAction (which is\nthe owner of the floating box). Since the computation of trend charts is quite expensive on the server side as well\n(several builds need to be read from disk and the interesting data points need to be computed) this process has been\nput into a separate background job. Once the computation is done the result is shown via an Ajax call. In order to\nhide these details for plugin authors you should simply derive your JobAction class from the corresponding\nAsyncTrendJobAction class, that already contains the boilerplate code. So your static plugin object model will actually\nbecome a little bit more complex:\n\nFigure 13. Jenkins chart model design\n\nBasically, you need to implement the method LinesChartModel createChartModel() to create the line\nchart. This method is quite simple to implement, since most of the hard work is provided by the library: you will\ninvoke with an iterator of your build actions, starting with the latest build. The iterator advances from build to build\nuntil no more results are available (or the maximum number of builds to consider has been reached). The most important\nthing to implement in your plugin is the way how data points are computed for a given BuildAction. Here is an example of\nsuch a SeriesBuilder implementation in the Forensics Plugin:\n\nFilesCountSeriesBuilder.java\n\npackage io.jenkins.plugins.forensics.miner;\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\nimport edu.hm.hafner.echarts.SeriesBuilder;\n\n/**\n * Builds one x-axis point for the series of a line chart showing the number of files in the repository.\n *\n * @author Ullrich Hafner\n */\npublic class FilesCountSeriesBuilder extends SeriesBuilder {\n    static final String TOTALS_KEY = \"total\";\n\n    @Override\n    protected Map computeSeries(final ForensicsBuildAction current) {\n        Map series = new HashMap<>();\n        series.put(TOTALS_KEY, current.getNumberOfFiles());\n        return series;\n    }\n}\n\nYou are not limited to a single line chart. You can show several lines in a single chart, you can show stacked values,\nor even the delta between some values. You can also have a look at the\ncharts of the warnings plugin\nto see some of these features in detail.\n\nFigure 14. Trend chart with several lines in the Warnings plugin\n\nFigure 15.

It is integrated into the build process to improve the code before it gets merged and released. Findsecbugs is a plugin for Spotbugs that adds 135 vulnerability types focused on the OWASP TOP 10 and the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). I’m working on integrating findsecbugs into our Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nBackground\n\nSpotbugs traces its history through Findbugs, which started in 2006. As Findbugs it was widely adopted by many projects. About 2016, the Findbugs project ground to a halt. Like the mythical phoenix, the Spotbugs project rose from the ashes to keep the capabilities alive. Most things are completely compatible between the two systems.\n\nJenkins has used Findbugs and now Spotbugs for years. This is integrated as a build step into parent Maven poms, including the plugin parent pom and the parent pom for libraries and core components. There are various properties that can be set to control the detection threshold, the effort, and findings or categories to exclude. Take a look at the effective pom for a project to see the settings.\n\nConundrums\n\nThere is a fundamental conundrum with introducing an analysis tool into a project. The best time to have done it is always in the past, particularly when the project first started. There are always difficulties in introducing it into an existing project. Putting it off for later just delays the useful results and makes later implementation more difficult. The best time to do it is now, as early as possible.\n\nAll analysis tools are imperfect. They report some issues that don’t actually exist. They miss some important issues. This is worse in legacy code, making the adoption more difficult. Findings have to be examined and evaluated. Some are code weaknesses but don’t indicate necessary fixes. For example, MD5 has been known for years as a weak algorithm, unsuitable for security uses. It can be used for non-security purposes, such as fingerprinting, but even there other algorithms (SHA-2) are preferred. We should replace all usages of MD5, but in some cases that’s difficult and it’s not exactly a problem.\n\nUltimately, the gain from these analysis tools isn’t so much from finding issues in existing code. The value comes more from catching new regressions that might be introduced or improving new code. This is one reason why it is valuable to add useful new analysis such as findsecbugs now, so that we can begin reaping the benefits.\n\nWith a security tool like findsecbugs, there is another paradox. Adding the tool makes it easier to find potential security issues. Attackers could take advantage of this information. However, security by obscurity is not a good design. Anyone can run findsecbugs now without the project integrating it. Integrating it makes it easier for legitimate developers to resolve issues and prevent future ones.\n\nImplementation\n\nI’ve been working on integrating findsecbugs into the Jenkins project for several months. It is working in several repos. There are several others where I have presented draft PRs to demonstrate what it will look like once it is enabled. As soon as we can disseminate the information enough, I propose to enable it in the parent poms for widespread use.\n\nExisting\n\nI started by enabling findsecbugs in two major components where I have a high degree of familiarity, Remoting, and Jenkins. Most of the work here involves examining each finding and figuring out what to do with it. In most cases this results in using one of the suppression mechanisms to ignore the finding. In some cases, the code can be removed or improved.\n\nFindsecbugs reported a significant number of false positives in Remoting for a couple of notable reasons. (See the PR.) Remoting uses Spotbugs aggressively with a Low threshold setting. This produces more results. Findsecbugs targets Java web applications. As the communication layer between agents and controller, Remoting uses some mechanisms that would be a problem on the server side but are acceptable on the agent.\n\nEven without all its plugins, Jenkins is a considerable collection of code. Findsecbugs reported a smaller number of false positives for Jenkins (See the PR.) It runs Spotbugs at a High threshold, so it only reports issues it deems more concerning. A number of these indicate code debt, deprecated code to remove, or areas that could be improved. I created Jira tickets for many of these.\n\nDemonstrated\n\nI have created draft PRs to demonstrate how findsecbugs will look in several plugins. The goal is not to use these PRs directly but instead integrate findsecbugs at the parent pom level. These PRs serve as reference documentation.\n\nCredentials\n\nThis one is particularly interesting because here findsecbugs correctly detects the remains of a valid security vulnerability ( CVE-2019-10320). Currently, this code is safely used only for migration of old data. If we had run findsecbugs on this plugin a year ago, it would have detected this valid vulnerability.\n\nSSH Build Agents\n\nThis one is interesting because it flags MD5 as a concern. Since it is used for fingerprinting, it isn’t a valid vulnerability, but since the hash isn’t stored it is easy to improve the code here.\n\nEC2\n\nIn this case, findsecbugs found some valid concerns, but the code isn’t used so it can be removed. Also, MD5 is harder to remove here but should be considered technical debt and removed when possible.\n\nPlatform Labeler\n\nFindsecbugs didn’t find any concerns here. This means adapting to it requires no work. In this demonstration, I added a fake finding to prove that it was working.\n\nFile Leak Detector\n\nThere is one simple finding noted here. Because it is part of the configuration performed by an administrator we can ignore it.\n\nCredentials Binding\n\nNothing was found here so integration requires no effort.\n\nProposed\n\nMy proposal is to integrate findsecbugs configuration into the parent poms as soon as we can. The delay is currently mostly around sharing the information to prepare developers by blog post, email list discussion, and presentation.\n\nEven before I started working on this, StefanSpieker proposed a PR to integrate into the parent Jenkins pom. This will apply to Jenkins libraries and core components. Once this is integrated, I will pull out the changes I made to the Jenkins and Remoting project poms.\n\nI also plan on integrating findsecbugs into the plugin and Stapler parent poms. Once it is added to the plugin parent pom all plugins will automatically perform these checks when they upgrade their parent pom version. If there are any findings, developers will need to take care of them as described in the next section.\n\nWhat do you need to do?\n\nOnce developers upgrade to a parent pom version that integrates findsecbugs, they may have to deal with evaluating, fixing, or suppressing findings. The parent pom versions do not yet exist but are in process or proposed.\n\nExtraneous build message\n\nIn some cases, an extraneous message may show up in the build logs. It starts with a line like this The following classes needed for analysis were missing: followed by lines listing some methods by name. Ignore this message. It results from SpotBugs printing some internal, debug information that isn’t helpful here.\n\nExamine findings\n\nIf findsecbugs reports any findings, then a developer needs to examine and determine what to do about each one.\n\nExcluding issues\n\nYou can exclude an issue, so that it is never reported in a project. This is done by configuring an exclusion file. If you encounter the findings CRLF_INJECTION_LOGS or INFORMATION_EXPOSURE_THROUGH_AN_ERROR_MESSAGE feel free to add these to an exclusion file. These are not considered a concern in Jenkins. See the Jenkins project exclusion file for an example. You should be cautious about including other issue types here.\n\nTemporarily disable findsecbugs\n\nYou may disable findsecbugs by adding to the exclusion file. I strongly encourage you to only disable findsecbugs temporarily when genuinely needed.\n\nSuppress a finding\n\nAfter determining that a finding is not important, you can suppress it by annotating a method or a class with @SuppressFBWarnings(value = “…​”, justification=”…​”). I encourage you to suppress narrowly. Never suppress at the class level when you can add it to a method. For a long method, extract the problematic part into a small method and add the suppression there. I also encourage you to always add a meaningful justification.\n\nImprove code\n\nWhenever possible improve the code such that the problematic code no longer exists. This can include removing deprecated or unused code, using improved algorithms, or improving structure or implementation. This is where the significant gains come from with SpotBugs and findsecbugs. Also, as you make changes or add new features make sure to implement them so as not to introduce new issues.\n\nReport security vulnerabilities\n\nIf you encounter a finding related to a valid security vulnerability, please report it via the Jenkins security reporting process. This is the responsible behavior that benefits the community. Try not to discuss or call attention to the issue before it can be disclosed in a Jenkins security advisory.\n\nCreate tasks\n\nIf you discover an improvement area that is too large to fit into your current work or release plan, I encourage you to record a task to get it done. You can do this in Jira, like I did for several issues in Jenkins core, or in whatever task management system you use.\n\nConclusion\n\nSpotBugs has long been used in Jenkins to catch bugs and improve code quality. Findsecbugs adds valuable security-related bug definitions. As we integrate it into the existing Jenkins code base it will require analysis and suppression for legacy code. This identifies areas we can improve and enhances quality as we move forward. Please responsibly report any security vulnerabilites you discover.","title":"Findsecbugs for Developers","tags":["jenkins","security","developer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#685848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/19e71/jeffret-b.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/77b35/jeffret-b.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/d4a57/jeffret-b.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/19e71/jeffret-b.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/68974/jeffret-b.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/ef6ff/jeffret-b.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/8257c/jeffret-b.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/6766a/jeffret-b.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/22bfc/jeffret-b.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"jeffret-b","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jeff has been using Jenkins for many years.\nSince 2018 he has been contributing to Jenkins core and plugins.\nHe maintains the Remoting library and participates on the Jenkins security team.</p>\n</div>","id":"jeffret-b","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Jeff Thompson","slug":"/blog/authors/jeffret-b","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b5d641eb-bed7-5caf-9805-42a1970f13d1","slug":"/blog/2020/03/02/pipeline-authoring-sig-update/","strippedHtml":"What is the Pipeline-Authoring Special Interest Group\n\nThis special interest group aims to improve and curate the experience of authoring Jenkins Pipelines. This includes the\nsyntax of `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries, code sharing and reuse, testing of Pipelines and shared libraries, IDE\nintegration and other development tools, documentation, best practices, and examples.\n\nWhat Are The Focus Areas of the Pipeline-Authoring Special Interest Group\n\nSyntax - How `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries are written.\n\nCode sharing and reuse - Shared libraries and future improvements.\n\nTesting - Unit and functional testing of `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries.\n\nIDE integration, editors, and other development tools - IDE plugins, visual editors, etc.\n\nDocumentation - Reference documentation, tutorials, and more.\n\nBest practices - Defining, maintaining, and evangelizing best practices in Jenkins Pipeline.\n\nExamples - Real-world `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries demonstrating how to utilize various features of Pipeline,\nas well as basic or starter `Jenkinsfile`s for common patterns that can be used as jumping-off points by new users.\n\nWhat Have We Been Up To\n\nWith the start of a new year, members got together to discuss the roadmap for 2020. During the initial discussions we\ndetermined that it would be good to examine the goals of previous meetings and determine the best path forward.\n\nA mutual decision was made that to better create a roadmap; we needed to understand better who we were aiming to help.\nWe decided that creating personas was very beneficial. Personas are fictional characters, which we are creating based\nupon our research to represent the different user types that might use Jenkins pipelines.\nCreating personas can help us step out of ourselves. It can help us to recognize that different people have different\nneeds and expectations, and it can also help us to identify with the user we are building the roadmap for. Personas make\nthe task at hand less complicated, they guide our ideation processes, and they can help us to achieve the goal of\ncreating a good user experience for our target user group.\nA lot of that work can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdyzJwt50Wk3uUNsLMl2d4w2MGYss-phqet0s-KjbEs/edit\nThe idea is to map the personas to a maturity model and then map the maturity model to the actual documentation. That\nmaturity model can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ByzWlPU0j1qM_gqspJppkNKkR5ZVLWlB/view\n\nHow Can I Get Involved\n\nWe have been meeting regularly to define personas to help us better create the SIG roadmap. We meet twice a week,\nonce on Thursday for the EMEA timezone and once on Friday for the US timezone. Meeting notes can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1EhWoBplGl4M8bHz0uuP-iOynPGuONjcz4enQm8sDyUE/edit# and the calendar, if you would\nlike to attend, is here: https://jenkins.io/event-calendar/. The previous recording of the meetings are\nlocated here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz_kPpb9C1w&list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOKKLBXek6iG8wTS24Ac7Y3\n\nNext Steps\n\nWe have a lot of work to do and could use your help. If you would love to join us, check out the meeting link. If you\nwould like to check out the personas and give feedback, also check out the link.\nOnce we have wrapped up the personas work, we will start to identify the available documentation and ensure we have\nadequate documentation with the help of the Doc SIG.\nWe will finally then start working to build out tools to help the community with pipelines in Jenkins better.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you would like to get in touch with the Pipeline-Authoring SIG, you can by joining the\nPipeline-Authoring SIG gitter channel or via the\nPipeline-Authoring SIG mailing list","title":"Pipeline-Authoring SIG Update","tags":["Pipeline-Authoring","SIG","community","opensource"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

Enhance developer experience by developing a VSCode Plugin to facilitate autocompletion and validation which would help the developer write correct yaml files before application to a Jenkins Instance.\n\nThe Configuration as Code plugin has been designed as an opinionated way to configure Jenkins based on human-readable declarative configuration files. Writing such a file should be feasible without being a Jenkins expert, just translating into code a configuration process one is used to executing in the web UI. The plugin uses a schema to verify the files being applied to the Jenkins instance.\n\nWith the new JSON Schema being enabled developers can now test their yaml file against it. The schema checks the descriptors i.e. configuration that can be applied to a plugin or Jenkins core, the correct type is used and help text is provided in some cases. VSCode allows us to test out the schema right out of the box with some modifications. This project was built as part of the Community Bridge initiative which is a platform created by the Linux Foundation to empower developers — and the individuals and companies who support them — to advance sustainability, security, and diversity in open source technology. You can take a look at the Jenkins Community Bridge Project Page\n\nSteps to Enable the Schema Validation\n\na) The first step includes installing the JCasC Plugin for Visual Studio Code and opening up the extension via the extension list. Shortcut for opening the extension list in VSCode editor using Ctrl + Shift + X.\n\nb) In order to enable validation we need to include it in the workspace settings.\nNavigate to File and then Preference and then Settings. Inside settings search for json and inside settings.json include the following configuration.\n\n{\n\"yaml.schemas\": {\n        \"schema.json\": \"y[a]?ml\"\n    }\n}\n\nYou can specify a glob pattern as the value for schema.json which is the file name for the schema. This would apply the schema to all yaml files. eg:.[y[a]?ml]\n\nc) The following tasks can be done using VSCode:\n\na) Auto completion (Ctrl + Space):\n  Auto completes on all commands.\n\nb) Document Outlining (Ctrl + Shift + O):\nProvides the document outlining of all completed nodes in the file.\n\nd) Create a new file under the work directory called jenkins.yml. For example consider the following contents for the file:\n\njenkins:\n  systemMessage: “Hello World”\n  numExecutors: 2\n\nThe above yaml file is valid according to the schema and vscode should provide you with validation and autocompletion for the same.\n\nScreenshots\n\nWe are holding an online meetup on the 26th February regarding this plugin and how you could use it to validate your YAML configuration files.\nFor any suggestions or dicussions regarding the schema feel free to join our gitter channel.\nIssues can be created on Github.","title":"Validating JCasC configuration files using Visual Studio Code","tags":["community-bridge","JCasC","VSCode","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"sladyn98","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sladyn is a Computer Science student at Mumbai University, India.\nHe is participating in Community Bridge 2019 to provide development tools to JCasC plugin in the form of IDE integrations, schema architecture improvements and configuration extension points <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin\">Configuration as Code Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"sladyn98","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sladyn Nunes","slug":"/blog/authors/sladyn98","twitter":"SladynN"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","id":"21c55fa8-27ea-50d0-a167-c780371a54d9","slug":"/blog/2020/02/19/jenkins-world-lisbon-with-love-from-india/","strippedHtml":"After an amazing three months of development period in the summer of 2019 with Jenkins Project, I was a better developer, loved open source, met\npassionate people and had fun at work. Jenkins is not just a community, it is a family. When GSoC period was over, we received swags from Jenkins.\nNatasha Stopa (one of the students in GSoC 2019) was invited to attend DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco.\nIt was nice to see her enjoy there. But guess what? Jenkins also invited three other students (Abhyudaya, Long and me) to DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon.\nI was super psyched when Marky Jackson (one of my project mentors) broke the news to me.\n\nThe trip to Lisbon required to sort a few things like flight tickets, hotel booking, passport, visa etc. Oleg Nenashev had scheduled meetings to discuss\nand help us with arranging everything for our travel. Thanks to him. :)\n\nFrom India to Lisbon (Dec 1)\n\nAbhyudaya and I boarded our flight from Indira Gandhi Airport (New Delhi) to Lisbon on December 1, 2019 morning at 0500 hours (local time). It was a fine\ntrip with an hour layover in Istanbul Ataturk Airport. We arrived in Lisbon at 1500 hours (local time). The weather in Lisbon was terrific. A mild cold\nbut strong sea breeze was the starting point of me falling in love with the place. We arrived at our hotel (Novotel Lisboa) in an Uber. Oleg met us at\nthe lobby to help us with check-in. It was great to finally meet him in person after months of knowing and working together. We had a good chat about the\nevent, what to expect and other sightseeing areas. After a short time of refresh, Long who traveled from Berlin a day before met us at the restaurant. We\nhad a brief chat knowing each other, had our food and went to bed. The next day was Hackfest. We hit the bed after that as we had to reach Centro de\nCongressos de Lisboa (CCL) where the event was organised by 0900 hours.\n\nDay 0 (Dec 2)\n\nI woke up early for a short jog in the streets. Lisbon is a city made on hills. The streets have beautiful mosaic styled pavements. It was\nnice to see around the city. Then Abhyudaya and me went for breakfast and reached CCL in an Uber at 0815 hours.\n\nThere was a round table sitting arrangement in an auditorium. It was like a meet-and-greet event to interact with other developers (some known and some new).\nEverybody had to figure out their problem statements and work on it. There was milk, juice, sandwiches which gave us energy throughout the day. I took a\nsmall break to come out of the building to go to the other side of the road which was on the banks of Tagus River. From there you could have very close\nview underneath the Ponte 25 de Abril (looks strikingly similar to Golden Gate Bridge). You can also see The Sanctuary of Christ the King on the other side\nof the river (again looks similar to Christ the Redeemer in Rio, Brazil). It was great to kick off the event with Hackfest. At the end of Hackfest some of\nus presented our work. Later, we went to a nearby restaurant to have burgers which apparently was the best burger I ever had (could be because I hadn’t\ntried too many burgers before :P). We talked and interacted with people from other parts of the world for about an hour and a half then went back to our hotel\nrooms.\n\nDay 1 (Dec 3)\n\nThe conference officially began on this day. Abyudaya and me had breakfast and took the shuttle to CCL. We collected our t-shirts and IDs. The event managing team\nmade an app for DevOps World | Jenkins World (DWJW) Lisbon with all schedules and other informations which was incredibly convenient for all attendees.\nThere were multiple sessions/events on different topics related to Jenkins or DevOps in general. I attended the Jenkins and Jenkins X contributor summit.\nHad a nice lunch and went around to explore Lisbon. I went to Padrao dos Descobrimentos and the beautiful Belem Palace. Had some Pasteis de Belem\n(a popular Portuguese desert). Took a tram to Praça do Comércio. It is Lisbon’s most important square. You will find lots of tourists, street bands,\nsea food restaurants, shops for every budget, the famous pink street and so much more. Later that evening we had a party hosted by EURODOG (European\nDevOps Group) at Lisboa Marriott. It was a nice party to network with developers over casual wine and beer. We later head out to a nearby Indian restaurant\nfor Kebab and rice.\n\nDay 2 (Dec 4)\n\nThe second day began with the opening keynote. Later went to the Jenkins X Introduction, Deploying K8s with Jenkins on GCP, Build top mobile games\nby King in that order. Also occasionally hitting the sponsors booth to have a chat and collect some swags. In the evening there was the superhero\nthemed party, sponsored by Sonatype. It was probably the most fun event in the entire conference. The expo hall had an entirely different look with the party lights on,\npeople wearing capes, fun events going around. There were artists dressed in a Bumblebee, a Batman, a Superman, a Supergirl, a Thor and more superhero\ncostumes! I was previously made aware of the interesting parties at Jenkins World but the experience was very different. People from all over the world had\ncome together to celebrate the 15 years of success of an open source software. After partying from 5 to 7 we went back to the hotel. I spent some time\nto prepare the slides for the next day’s presentation and went to bed.\n\nDay 3 (Dec 5)\n\nThe third and final day of conference began with Jenkins World Fun Run. I missed the keynote for being late and other setup required for the\npresentation. My laptop was broken so had to do all the setup for demo on a friend’s laptop. The situation felt like a Jenkins admin under fire\nfor a production bug. After being under pressure for a while, took a break to admire the developer comics and had a chat with the graffiti painter.\nDuring lunch it was time for the GSoC presentation at the Jenkins community booth. All our presentation went well and we also interacted with real users.\nThen we had the GSoC Team pic at the Jenkins community booth. Later Abhyudaya and me gave our presentation at the lightning talks as well upon Mark Waite’s\nrequest. The event concluded with emotional goodbyes.\n\nAll GSoC Students were invited for dinner at Corinthia Lisboa’s Soul Garden restaurant. The party comprised of Oleg, Mark and his lovely wife, Liam, Tracy,\nAlyssa and Olivier. We had a very nice conversation and I had a very delicious Bacalhau (cod fish) dish. Then bid final goodbye to everybody.\n\nIt was a wonderful experience in a wonderful country among wonderful people. Hats off to the management team lead by Alyssa Tong and co. An event this big was\ncarried out without any hiccups! Everybody contributed their part to the event which made it very interactive and fun. Checkout some of my swags:\n\nA big shout out to the Jenkins project and CloudBees for sponsoring this trip. Also thank you Jenkins and Google Summer of Code for support. :)","title":"My DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon Experience","tags":["gitlab","devopsworld","jenkinsworld","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/20305/baymac.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/eb017/baymac.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/ed0e7/baymac.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/20305/baymac.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/b3c75/baymac.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/bcdad/baymac.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/21187/baymac.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/33025/baymac.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/d386c/baymac.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":192}}},"blog":null,"github":"baymac","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2019 student under Jenkins project.
