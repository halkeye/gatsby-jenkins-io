My project for Google Summer of Code 2019 is Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features. This is the first time I have contributed for Jenkins and I am very excited to announce the features that have been done in Phase 1.\n\nProject Introduction\n\nCurrent version of Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin requires users to manually configure the entire system which includes Zookeeper, Kafka and remoting agents. It also doesn’t support dynamic agent provisioning so scalability is harder to achieve. My project aims to solve two problems:\n\nOut-of-the-box solution to provision Apache Kafka cluster.\n\nDynamic agent provisioning in a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nCurrent State\n\nKubernetes connector with credentials supported.\n\nApache Kafka provisioning in Kubernetes feature is fully implemented.\n\nHelm chart is partially implemented.\n\nApache Kafka provisioning in Kubernetes\n\nThis feature is part of 2.0 version so it is not yet released officially. You can try out the feature by using the Experimental Update Center to update to 2.0.0-alpha version or building directly from master branch:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting-kafka-plugin.git\ncd remoting-kafka-plugin/plugin\nmvn hpi:run\n\nOn the Global Configuration page, users can input Kubernetes server information and credentials. Then they can start Apache Kafka with only one button click.\n\nWhen users click Start Kafka on Kubernetes button, Jenkins will create a Kubernetes client from the information and then apply Zookeeper and Kafka YAML specification files from resources.\n\nHelm Chart\n\nHelm chart for Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin is based on stable/jenkins chart and incubator/kafka chart. As of now, the chart is still a Work in Progress because it is still waiting for Cloud API implementation in Phase 2. However, you can check out the demo chart with a single standalone Remoting Kafka Agent:\n\ngit clone -b demo-helm-phase-1 https://github.com/longngn/remoting-kafka-plugin.git\ncd remoting-kafka-plugin\nK8S_NODE=./helm/jenkins-remoting-kafka/do.sh start\n\nThe command do.sh start will do the following steps:\n\nInstall the chart (with Jenkins and Kafka).\n\nLaunch a Kafka computer on Jenkins controller by applying the following JCasC.\n\njenkins:\n  nodes:\n    - permanent:\n        name: \"test\"\n        remoteFS: \"/home/jenkins\"\n        launcher:\n          kafka: {}\n\nLaunch a single Remoting Kafka Agent pod.\n\nYou can check the chart state by running kubectl, for example:\n\n$ kubectl get all -n demo-helm\nNAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/demo-jenkins-998bcdfd4-tjmjs        2/2     Running   0          6m30s\npod/demo-jenkins-remoting-kafka-agent   1/1     Running   0          4m10s\npod/demo-kafka-0                        1/1     Running   0          6m30s\npod/demo-zookeeper-0                    1/1     Running   0          6m30s\n\nNAME                              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE\nservice/demo-0-external           NodePort    10.106.254.187 19092:31090/TCP              6m30s\nservice/demo-jenkins              NodePort    10.101.84.33 8080:31465/TCP               6m31s\nservice/demo-jenkins-agent        ClusterIP   10.97.169.65 50000/TCP                    6m31s\nservice/demo-kafka                ClusterIP   10.106.248.10 9092/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-kafka-headless       ClusterIP   None 9092/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-zookeeper            ClusterIP   10.109.222.63 2181/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-zookeeper-headless   ClusterIP   None 2181/TCP,3888/TCP,2888/TCP   6m31s\n\nNAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/demo-jenkins   1/1     1            1           6m30s\n\nNAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\nreplicaset.apps/demo-jenkins-998bcdfd4   1         1         1       6m30s\n\nNAME                              READY   AGE\nstatefulset.apps/demo-kafka       1/1     6m30s\nstatefulset.apps/demo-zookeeper   1/1     6m30s\n\nNext Phase Plan\n\nImplement Cloud API to provision Remoting Kafka Agent.

Jobs that run outside of configured working hours are held until the next allowable build time.\n\nFor the first code phase at Google Summer of Code, I’ve been working on Working Hours Project, which needed improvements on usability.\n\nRather than classical Jelly pages, React seems to be more prefered when we want to design a much customized UI with a huge amount of libraries we could use, especially the open source components such as date pickers.\n\nBut we have to face a challenge of the integration of React and Jenkins, which I’m currently working on.\n\nAchievements For The First Code Phase\n\nFor the first code phase, we are focusing on the UI improvements, we’ve achieved following major improvements:\n\nA standalone webapp which could be then integrated.\n\nSlider for choosing a time range.\n\nMore fields when setting a excluded date.\n\nPresets for choosing a excluded date.\n\nA Jenkins styling UI.\n\nHow We Integrate React Into Jenkins\n\nA solution doc for integration could be found at\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1JLRCDg9JNBWR0Dfq8w3pTI9mrl6i9JU29pBoH6bO0J8\n\nAt first, we found BlueOcean is a great example for using React in Jenkins, but yet it’s not a choice for common development with plugins. So we need to find out another way to integrate.\n\nHere are the steps to do the integration:\n\nA mount point in your jelly file, usually it’s a element with a unique id.\n\nWrite your React Application, but need to set the mount point to the id you set above.\n\nCopy the output after you build the Project into the plugin’s webapp dir.\n\nAdd your files using a script tag in your jelly file.\n\nOnce we are using React, the traditional jelly request won’t be available anymore, another way to process requests will be using stapler. You can define a process function like below.\n[source, java]\n\npublic HttpResponse doDynamic(StaplerRequest request) {\n        if (config == null) {\n            config = ExtensionList.lookup(WorkingHoursPlugin.class).get(0);\n        }\n        String restOfPath = request.getRestOfPath();\n        String[] pathTokens = restOfPath.split(\"/\");\n        List params = new ArrayList<>();\n        switch (params.get(0)) {\n            case \"list-excluded-dates\":\n                return listExcludedDate(request);\n            case \"set-excluded-dates\":\n                return setExcludedDates(request);\n            case \"list-time-ranges\":\n                return listTimeRanges(request);\n            case \"set-time-ranges\":\n                return setTimeRanges(request);\n        }\n    }\n\nRun Our Application\n\nIf you would like to take a look at our plugin, you can go to the repo\nworking-hours-plugin\n\nJust follow the README file, then you could run a copy of your working hours plugin.\n\nScreenshots\n\nThe current plugin’s outlook is a bit simple and the plugin is a bit unconvinient for use.\n\nOne of the problems is that if we want to input a excluded date, it’ll be a string in a constant format like 15/9/2019, but the new UI choosed React so we could use a datepicker to improve this.\n\nCurrent Plugin\n\nNew (Time Ranges)\n\nNew (Exclude Dates)\n\nHelpful links\n\nIf you have any questions or advices, we are glad to hear from you.\n\nSeveral useful links are listed below:\n\nDevelop Repo\n\nMain Repo\n\nDesign Doc\n\nDoc for React Integration Solution\n\nGitter Chat\n\nSlides for Phase 1 Demo\n\nVideo Recording for Phase 1","title":"GSOC Phase 1 Updates On Working Hours Plugin","tags":["react","plugins","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/77b35/jackshen.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/d4a57/jackshen.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/14734/jackshen.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ef6ff/jackshen.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/8257c/jackshen.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/f4bd7/jackshen.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/65cd2/jackshen.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":129}}},"blog":null,"github":"ShenJack","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Shen is a student from Beijing Forestry University.

This issue made it difficult to quickly identify why a build was unstable, and forced users to read through builds logs and the Jenkinsfile to figure out what actually happened.\n\nIn order to fix this issue, we introduced a new Pipeline API that can be used to attach additional result information to individual Pipeline steps. Visualization tools like Blue Ocean use this new API when deciding how a given stage should be displayed. Steps like junit that used to set only the overall build result now additionally use the new API to set step-level result information. We created the new unstable and warnError steps so that Pipeline authors with more complicated use cases can still take advantage of this new API.\n\nThe core fixes for the issue are present in the following plugins, all of which require Jenkins 2.138.4 or newer:\n\nPipeline: API 2.34\n\nPipeline: Basic Steps 2.18 (requires a simultaneous update to Pipeline: Groovy 2.70)\n\nPipeline: Graph Analysis 1.10\n\nPipeline: Declarative 1.3.9\n\nBlue Ocean 1.17.0\n\nHere is a screenshot from Blue Ocean of a Pipeline using the unstable step where only the failing stage is marked as unstable:\n\nExamples\n\nHere are some examples of how to update your Pipelines to use the new improvements:\n\nUse the new warnError step to catch errors and mark the build and stage as unstable. warnError requires a single String parameter, which is a message to log when an error is caught. When warnError catches an error, it logs the message  and the error and sets the build and stage result to unstable. Using it looks like this:\n\nwarnError('Script failed!') {\n  sh('false')\n}\n\nUse the new unstable step to set the build and stage result to unstable. This step can be used as a direct replacement for currentBuild.result = 'UNSTABLE', and may be useful in cases where warnError is not flexible enough. unstable requires a single String parameter, which is a message to log when the step runs. Using it might look like this:\n\ntry {\n  sh('false')\n} catch (ex) {\n  unstable('Script failed!')\n}\n\nJUnit Plugin : Update to version 1.28 or newer to pick up fixes for the junit step so that it correctly marks the stage as unstable.\n\nWarnings Next Generation Plugin : Update to version 5.2.0 or newer to pick up fixes for the publishIssues and recordIssues steps so that they correctly mark the stage as unstable.\n\nOther Plugins : If your Pipeline is marked as unstable by a step in another plugin, please file a new issue with the component set to that plugin (after checking for duplicates), clearly describing which step has the problem and under what circumstances it occurs, and link to the developer section of this post as a reference for how the maintainer might be able to address the problem.\n\nLimitations\n\nIf you do not migrate to the unstable or warnError steps, or update plugins that set the build result to versions that integrate with the new API, then in cases where the build is unstable, Blue Ocean will not show any stages as unstable.\n\nEven after these changes, currentBuild.result continues to refer only to the overall build result. Unfortunately, it was not possible to adapt the currentBuild global variable to make it track step or stage-level results, since it is implemented as a global variable, which means it does not have any step-level context through which it could use the new API.\n\nPipeline Stage View Plugin has not yet been updated to use the new API, so these changes do not affect the visualization it provides.\n\nHistory\n\nJenkins Pipeline steps can complete in one of two ways: successfully, by returning a (possibly null) result, or unsuccessfully, by throwing an exception. When a step fails by throwing an exception, that exception propagates throughout the Pipeline until another step or Groovy code catches it, or it reaches the top level of the Pipeline, which causes the Pipeline itself to fail. Depending on the type of exception thrown, the final result of the Pipeline may be something other than failure (for example in some cases it will be aborted). Because of the way the exception propagates, it is easy for tools like Blue Ocean to identify steps (and therefore stages) which failed due to an exception.\n\nIn order for Pipelines to be able to interact with established Jenkins APIs, it was also necessary for Pipeline builds to have an overall build result that can be modified during the build. Among other things, this allows Pipelines to use build steps and wrappers that were originally written for use in Freestyle projects.\n\nIn some cases, it is desirable for a Pipeline step to be able to complete successfully so that the rest of the Pipeline continues normal execution, but for it to be able to note that some kind of error occurred so that visualizations are able to identify that something went wrong with the step, even though it didn’t fail completely. A good example of this is the junit step. This step looks at specified test results, and if there were any failures, marks the overall build result as unstable. This kind of behavior is problematic for visualization tools like Blue Ocean, because the step completed successfully, and there is no programmatic way to associate the overall build result with the step that ended up setting that result.\n\nLooking at JENKINS-39203 again, we see that there were essentially two options for the visualization. If the overall build result was unstable, either all steps that completed successfully could be shown as unstable, because they may have been the step that caused the build to become unstable, or they could be shown as successful, because we have no way to relate the setting of the build result to a specific step. In the end, the first option was chosen.\n\nTo work around this issue, some users tried to do things like throw exceptions and add try/catch blocks around stages that handle exceptions so that Blue Ocean would be able to use the exceptions to mark step and stage results as desired, and then by catching the exception the Pipeline would be able to continue normal execution. These kinds of workarounds were hard to understand, fragile, and did not work well (if at all) for Declarative Pipelines.\n\nDevelopers\n\nIf you are a developer of a plugin that integrates with Pipeline using a step, and want to take advantage of the new API so that your step can report an non-successful result without throwing an exception, please see this post to the Jenkins Developers mailing list, and respond there if you have any questions.","title":"Jenkins Pipeline Stage Result Visualization Improvements","tags":["pipeline","blueocean"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"dwnusbaum","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Devin has worked on various areas of Jenkins for the past two years as a software engineer at CloudBees.

The plugins are downloaded from the update center\nto a specified directory, and can then be loaded into Jenkins. Currently, the plugins to be downloaded can be specified via a plugins.txt file and/or the -plugins cli option, but we plan to further expand the input formats that can be accepted.\nCustom version specifiers for different update centers are also supported.\n\nThe library will first check if any of the requested plugins are currently either installed in the user-specified download location or user-specified Jenkins war file.\nAlready installed plugins will be ignored or upgraded if a higher version is requested or required as a dependency.  After determining the plugin download URL, the library\nwill download the plugins and resolve and download their dependencies.\n\nThis is just the beginning: the plugin manager library and cli tool are very much still a work in progress.\nFor the most up-to-date information on CLI options and how to run the tool, see the repository README.md.\nMore robust input parsing, support for security warnings and available updates, Docker integration, and additional features coming soon!\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nFeel free to reach out through\nthe Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list.

The plan is to create the following\nplugins:\n\nGitLab API Plugin - Wraps GitLab Java APIs.\n\nGitLab Branch Source Plugin - Contains two packages:\n\nio.jenkins.plugins.gitlabserverconfig - Manages server configuration and web hooks management.\nIdeally should reside inside another plugin with name GitLab Plugin. In future, this package should\nbe moved into a new plugin.\n\nio.jenkins.plugins.gitlabbranchsource - Adds GitLab Branch Source for Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs (including\nMerge Requests) and Folder organisation.\n\nPresent State\n\nFreeStyle Job and Pipeline(Single Branch) Job are fully supported.\n\nMulti-branch Pipeline Job is partially supported (no MRs detection).\n\nGitLab Folder Organisation is not supported.\n\nGoals of this project\n\nImplement a lightweight GitLab Plugin that depends on GitLab API Plugin.\n\nFollow convention of 3 separate plugins i.e. GitLab Plugin, GitLab API Plugin, GitLab Branch Source Plugin.\n\nImplement GitLab Branch Source Plugin with support for Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs.\n\nSupport new Jenkins features such as\nJenkins Code as Configuration (JCasC),\nIncremental Tools.\n\nClear & Efficient design.\n\nSupport new SCM Trait APIs.\n\nSupport Java 8 and above.\n\nBuilding the plugin\n\nNo binaries are available for this plugin as the plugin is in the very early alpha stage, and not ready for the general\npublic quite yet.  If you want to jump in early, you can try building it yourself from source.\n\nInstallation:\n\nCheckout source code to your local machine:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/baymac/gitlab-branch-source-plugin.git\n\ncd gitlab-branch-source-plugin\n\nInstall the plugin:\n\nmvn clean install\n\nmvn clean install -DskipTests # to skip tests\n\nRun the plugin:\n\nmvn hpi:run # runs a Jenkins instance at localhost:8080\n\nmvn hpi:run -Djetty.port= # to run on your desired port number\n\nIf you want to test it with your Jenkins server, after mvn clean install follow these steps in your Jenkins instance:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Manage Plugins\n\nSelect Advanced tab\n\nIn Upload Plugin section, select Choose file\n\nSelect $ /target/gitlab-branch-source.hpi\n\nSelect Upload\n\nSelect Install without restart\n\nUsage\n\nAssuming plugin installation has done been already.\n\nSetting up GitLab Server Configuration on Jenkins\n\nOn jenkins, select Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Configure System\n\nScroll down to find the GitLab section\n\nSelect Add GitLab Server | Select GitLab Server\n\nNow you will now see the GitLab Server Configuration options.\n\nThere are 4 fields that needs to be configured:\n\nName - Plugin automatically generates an unique server name for you. User may want to configure this field\nto suit their needs but should make sure it is sufficiently unique. We recommend to keep it as it is.\n\nServer URL - Contains the URL to your GitLab Server. By default it is set to \"https://gitlab.com\". User can\nmodify it to enter their GitLab Server URL e.g. https://gitlab.gnome.org/, http://gitlab.example.com:7990. etc.\n\nCredentials - Contains a list of credentials entries that are of type GitLab Personal Access Token. When\nno credential has been added it shows \"-none-\". User can add a credential by clicking \"Add\" button.\n\nWeb Hook - This field is a checkbox. If you want the plugin to setup a webhook on your GitLab project(s)\nrelated jobs, check this box. The plugin listens to a URL for the concerned GitLab project(s) and when an event\noccurs in the GitLab Server, the server sends an event trigger to the URL where the web hook is setup. If you\nwant continuous integration (or continuous delivery) on your GitLab project then you may want to automatically\nset it up.\n\nAdding a Personal Access Token Credentials (To automatically generate Personal Access Token see\nnext section):\n\nUser is required to add a GitLab Personal Access Token type credentials entry to securely persist the token\ninside Jenkins.\n\nGenerate a Personal Access Token on your GitLab Server:\n\nSelect profile dropdown menu from top-right corner\n\nSelect Settings\n\nSelect Access Token from left column\n\nEnter a name | Set Scope to api, read_user, read_repository\n\nSelect Create Personal Access Token\n\nCopy the token generated\n\nReturn to Jenkins | Select Add in Credentials field | Select Jenkins\n\nSet Kind to GitLab Personal Access Token\n\nEnter Token\n\nEnter a unique id in ID\n\nEnter a human readable description\n\nSelect Add\n\nTesting connection:\n\nSelect your desired token in the Credentials dropdown\n\nSelect Test Connection\n\nIt should return something like Credentials verified for user\n\nSelect Apply (at the bottom)\n\nGitLab Server is now setup on Jenkins\n\nCreating Personal Access Token within Jenkins\n\nAlternatively, users can generate a GitLab Personal Access Token within Jenkins itself and automatically add the\nGitLab Personal Access Token credentials to Jenkins server credentials.\n\nSelect Advanced at the bottom of GitLab Section\n\nSelect Manage Additional GitLab Actions\n\nSelect Convert login and password to token\n\nSet the GitLab Server URL\n\nThere are 2 options to generate token;\n\nFrom credentials - To select an already persisting Username Password Credentials or add an Username Password\ncredential to persist it.\n\nFrom login and password - If this is a one time thing then you can directly enter you credentials to the text boxes\nand the username/password credential is not persisted.\n\nAfter setting your username/password credential, select Create token credentials.\n\nThe token creator will create a Personal Access Token in your GitLab Server for the given user with the\nrequired scope and also create a credentials for the same inside Jenkins server. You can go back to the GitLab Server\nConfiguration to select the new credentials generated (select \"-none-\" first then new credentials will appear). For\nsecurity reasons this token is not revealed as plain text rather returns an id. It is a 128-bit long UUID-4 string\n(36 characters).\n\nConfiguration as Code\n\nNo need for messing around in the UI. Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) or simply Configuration as Code Plugin\nallows you to configure Jenkins via a yaml file. If you are a first time user, you can learn more about JCasC\nhere.\n\nAdd configuration YAML:\n\nThere are multiple ways to load JCasC yaml file to configure Jenkins:\n\nJCasC by default searches for a file with the name jenkins.yaml in $JENKINS_ROOT.\n\nThe JCasC looks for an environment variable CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG which contains the path\nfor the configuration yaml file.\n\nA path to a folder containing a set of config files e.g. /var/jenkins_home/casc_configs.\n\nA full path to a single file e.g. /var/jenkins_home/casc_configs/jenkins.yaml.\n\nA URL pointing to a file served on the web e.g. /jenkins.yaml\" class=\"bare\">https:// /jenkins.yaml .\n\nYou can also set the configuration yaml path in the UI. Go to /configuration-as-code.\nEnter path or URL to jenkins.yaml and select Apply New Configuration.\n\nAn example of configuring GitLab server via jenkins.yaml :\n\ncredentials:\n  system:\n    domainCredentials:\n      - credentials:\n          - gitlabPersonalAccessToken:\n              scope: SYSTEM\n              id: \"i<3GitLab\"\n              token: \"XfsqZvVtAx5YCph5bq3r\" # gitlab personal access token\n\nunclassified:\n  gitLabServers:\n    servers:\n      - credentialsId: \"i<3GitLab\"\n        manageHooks: true\n        name: \"gitlab.com\"\n        serverUrl: \"https://gitlab.com\"\n\nFor better security, see handling secrets\nsection in JCasC\ndocumentation.\n\nFuture Scope of work\n\nThe second phase of GSoC will be utilized to develop GitLab Branch Source. The new feature is a work in progress, but\nthe codebase is unstable and requires lot of bugfixes. Some features like Multibranch Pipeline Jobs are functioning\nproperly. More about it at the end of second phase.\n\nIssue Tracking\n\nThis project uses Jenkins JIRA to track issues. You can file issues under\ngitlab-branch-source-plugin component.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis plugin is built and maintained by the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Team for\nMulti-branch Pipeline\nSupport for GitLab.

To make our job a bit easier,\nwe chose Java Microbenchmark Harness for running these benchmarks. This\nallows us to reliably measure performance of our time-critical functions and will help make Jenkins perform faster\nfor everyone.\n\nThe micro-benchmarking framework was recently released in the Jenkins Unit Test Harness 2.50.\nThe blog post below shows how to run benchmarks in your plugins.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe framework runs works by starting a temporary Jenkins instance for each fork of the JMH benchmark,\njust like JenkinsRule from Jenkins Test Harness. Benchmarks are run directly from your JUnit Tests which allows\nyou to fail builds on the fly and easily run benchmarks from your IDE, just like unit tests. You can easily\nconfigure your benchmarks by either using your Java methods, or by using Jenkins Configuration-as-Code plugin\nand passing the path to your YAML file.\n\nTo run benchmarks from your plugins, you need to do the following:\n\nbump up the minimum required Jenkins version to 2.60.3 or above\n\nbump Plugin-POM to a version ≥ 3.46 or manually upgrade to Jenkins Test Harness ≥ 2.51.\n\nNow, to run the benchmarks, you need to have a benchmark runner that contains a @Test so it can run\nlike a JUnit test. From inside a test method, you can use the OptionsBuilder provided by JMH to\nconfigure your benchmarks. For example:\n\npublic class BenchmarkRunner {\n    @Test\n    public void runJmhBenchmarks() throws Exception {\n        ChainedOptionsBuilder options = new OptionsBuilder()\n                .mode(Mode.AverageTime)\n                .forks(2)\n                .result(\"jmh-report.json\");\n\n        // Automatically detect benchmark classes annotated with @JmhBenchmark\n        new BenchmarkFinder(getClass()).findBenchmarks(options);\n        new Runner(options.build()).run();\n    }\n}\n\nSample benchmarks\n\nNow, you can write your first benchmark:\n\nWithout any special setup\n\n@JmhBenchmark\npublic class JmhStateBenchmark {\n    public static class MyState extends JmhBenchmarkState {\n    }\n\n    @Benchmark\n    public void benchmark(MyState state) {\n        // benchmark code goes here\n        state.getJenkins().setSystemMessage(\"Hello world\");\n    }\n}\n\nUsing Configuration as Code\n\nTo use configuration as code, apart from the dependencies above you also need to add the following\nto your pom.xml :\n\nio.jenkins\nconfiguration-as-code\n1.21\ntrue\n\nio.jenkins\nconfiguration-as-code\n1.21\ntests\ntest\n\nNow configuring a benchmark is as simple as providing path to your YAML file and specifying the class\ncontaining the benchmark state.\n\n@JmhBenchmark\npublic class SampleBenchmark {\n    public static class MyState extends CascJmhBenchmarkState {\n        @NonNull\n        @Override\n        protected String getResourcePath() {\n            return \"config.yml\";\n        }\n\n        @NonNull\n        @Override\n        protected Class getEnclosingClass() {\n            return SampleBenchmark.class;\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Benchmark\n    public void benchmark(MyState state) {\n        Jenkins jenkins = state.getJenkins(); // jenkins is configured and ready to be benchmarked.\n        // your benchmark code goes here...\n    }\n}\n\nMore Samples\n\nAs a part of this project, a few benchmarks have been created in the Role Strategy Plugin which show\nconfiguring the instances for various situations. You can find them\nhere.\n\nRunning Benchmarks\n\nRunning benchmarks from Maven\n\nTo easily run benchmarks from Maven, a Maven profile to run the benchmarks has been created\nand is available starting Plugin-POM version 3.45. You can then run your benchmarks from the\ncommand line using mvn test -Dbenchmark.\n\nRunning benchmarks on ci.jenkins.io\n\nIf you have your plugins hosted on ci.jenkins.io, you can easily run benchmarks directly from your Jenkinsfile\nby using the runBenchmarks() method after the buildPlugin() step in your which is now available in\nJenkins Pipeline library.\nThis function also accepts the path to your generated JMH benchmark reports as an optional\nparameter and archives the benchmark results. Running benchmarks in pull request builds allows you to constantly\nmonitor the performance implications of a given change. For example, the Jenkinsfile from Role Strategy Plugin:\n\nbuildPlugin()\nrunBenchmarks('jmh-report.json')\n\nVisualizing benchmark results\n\nBenchmark reports generated (in JSON) can be visualized using the either the JMH Report Plugin\nor by passing the benchmark reports to the JMH visualizer web service. As an example, here is\na visualized report of some benchmarks from the Role Strategy Plugin:\n\nThese improvements seen above were obtained through a small pull request\nto the plugin and shows how even seemingly small changes can bring major performance improvements. Microbenchmarks\nhelp to find these hot-spots and estimate the impact of changes.\n\nSome tips and tricks\n\nSince BenchmarkRunner class name in the example above does not qualify as a test according to Maven surefire plugin’s\nnaming conventions, the benchmarks will not interfere with your JUnit tests.\n\nBenchmark methods need to be annotated by @Benchmark for JMH to detect them.\n\nClasses containing benchmarks are found automatically by the BenchmarkFinder\nwhen annotated with @JmhBenchmark.\n\nA reference to the Jenkins instance is available through either JmhBenchmarkState#getJenkins() or through\nJenkins.getInstance() like you would otherwise do.\n\nJmhBenchmarkState provides setup() and tearDown() methods which can be overridden to configure the\nJenkins instance according to your benchmark’s requirements.\n\nThe benchmark builds on ci.jenkins.io are currently throttled because of the limited availability of highmem nodes.\n\nThe benchmark framework was made available in Jenkins Test Harness 2.50, it is recommended to use version 2.51 as it includes some bug fixes.\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nIf you have any feedback, comments or questions, please feel free to reach out to me through either\nthe Role Strategy Plugin Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list.\n\nPresentation slides\n\nDemo at Platform SIG meeting\n\nDocumentation for the micro-benchmark framework:\n\nWriting benchmarks (Jenkins Test Harness)\n\nPreconfiguring benchmarks using JCasC\n\nRunning benchmarks using Plugin POM profile\n\nBuild Step for running benchmarks on ci.jenkins.io","title":"Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins","tags":["jmh","plugins","benchmark","performance","developer","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/ff5b9/abhyudayasharma.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/f4523/abhyudayasharma.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/1e7bb/abhyudayasharma.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/ff5b9/abhyudayasharma.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/b48b6/abhyudayasharma.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/1fd06/abhyudayasharma.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/9edd6/abhyudayasharma.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/f5f75/abhyudayasharma.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/05d06/abhyudayasharma.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":142}}},"blog":null,"github":"AbhyudayaSharma","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Abhyudaya is a Computer Science student at Shiv Nadar University, India.\nHe is participating in Google Summer of Code 2019 to improve the performance\nof the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin\">Role Strategy Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"abhyudayasharma","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Abhyudaya Sharma","slug":"/blog/authors/abhyudayasharma","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","id":"42277358-8fb3-53f2-a4d7-e57be525c9e9","slug":"/blog/2019/06/03/DevOps-World-Jenkins-World-2019-San-Francisco-Agenda-is-Live/","strippedHtml":"We are a little over two months away from the largest Jenkins gathering of the year.  From Jenkins users, to maintainers, contributors, mentors and those new to Jenkins this event will have something for everyone.\n\nThis year’s DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco has moved to a larger venue to facilitate the growth. From August 12 - 15, 2019 the event will take place at the Moscone West Center.  The event boasts 100+ sessions, and will offer training, hands-on workshops, onsite certification, contributor summit and much more.  Conference attendees can expect to be inspired while learning the latest innovations from industry leaders. Attendees will learn the value that digital transformation has in delivering software more efficiently, more quickly and with higher quality.\n\nWe are excited to announce most of the agenda for DevOps World Jenkins World San Francisco is now live. We will continue to fill out the agenda with more sessions, trainings/workshops, and activities. Below is a small sampling of sessions from some of our favorite Jenkins contributors:\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code: try it & start contributing! - Ewelina Wilkosz\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code is an open source Jenkins plugin that allows users to keep complete Jenkins configuration in a simple configuration file (yaml format). In the talk, I’ll briefly present the history of the plugin, the vision for the future and current status. Then I’ll move to the demo section where I’ll show how easy it is to configure and run Jenkins with the help of the plugin.\n\nThinking about Jenkins Security - Mark Waite & Wadeck Follonier\n\nJenkins security concepts, authorization, authentication and auditing, secure builds, agent security, configuration and administration security, auditing, and security best practices.\n\nDocker and Jenkins [as Code] - Dr. Oleg Nenashev\n\nThe Configuration as Code plugin is a new milestone which enables managing Jenkins configurations via YAML. Together with Docker, this plugin offers many ways to produce ready-to-fly Jenkins images for any environments. In my talk, I will describe official controller and agent images offered by the Jenkins project. What’s inside them? How do you configure images with JCasC and Groovy hooks? How do you use these approaches together? And, finally, how do you simplify packaging of custom Jenkins images and define the entire system [as code]?\n\nCan Jenkins be the Engine of Mobile DevOps? - Shashikant Jagtap\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the following topics:\n\nHow mobile DevOps is different than web DevOps\n\nChallenges in mobile DevOps ( iOS and Android)\n\nHow Jenkins fits in mobile DevOps and CI/CD pipelines\n\nWhat Jenkins misses for mobile\n\nHow we can make Jenkins better for mobile apps\n\nCreating a CI/CD Pipeline for Your Shared Libraries - Roderick Randolph\n\nAt Capital One we run tens of thousands of CI/CD pipelines on Jenkins, leveraging the Jenkins Pipeline shared libraries extension to enable code reuse and decrease time to market for dev teams. A code change to our shared library goes live immediately and is consumed the next time a team triggers their project’s pipeline. So, why do we have such high confidence that a code change to our library won’t break a team’s pipeline? The answer: we’ve developed a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for our shared library.\n\nDuring this talk, you will learn how to create a fully automated pipeline for your shared libraries including how to develop tests, create canary releases, monitor for issues and quickly rollback changes to your shared library to achieve rapid delivery while minimizing any impact on dev teams.\n\nHow Jenkins Builds and Delivers Jenkins in the Cloud - Brian Benz & Tyler Croy\n\nWant to know how Jenkins builds Jenkins? Catch this session to see the real-life implementation of Jenkins’ development (at ci.jenkins.io) and delivery infrastructure in the cloud as it evolved from a mix of platforms to multi-platform VMs, containers and Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure.  Expect a frank discussion of issues that were encountered along the way, how the architecture has evolved and what’s on the roadmap.  We’ll share important tips and tricks for implementing your own Jenkins infrastructure on any cloud, based on Jenkins’ own implementation experience.\n\nDeclarative Pipeline 2019: Tips, Tricks and What’s Next - Liam Newman\n\nAre you using Declarative Pipeline? Are you considering using them? Are you just curious? Well, we’re going to help you get more out of Declarative Pipeline with less complexity and less effort. We’ll walk through some best practices, point out some tricks you might not have known, warn you off some common mistakes, review what’s changed in the last year and give you a preview of what we’re working on for Declarative Pipeline going forward.\n\nSay Goodbye to Hello World, Say Hello to Real World Delivery Pipelines - Brian Benz & Jessica Deen\n\nAre you tired of \"Hello World\" and hypothetical demos? So are we! In this code-heavy, deeply technical session, you’ll learn more than just tips and tricks.  You’ll learn best practices and how to start from absolute zero.

In that first article, the jenkins.io site was reviewed, learning about\nthe multiple ways in which we can participate and contribute. Then, a first—​basic—​contribution I made to the site\nrepository was described.\n\nNow, in this new article we will be exploring more advanced contributions, committing code to the actual Jenkins core.\n\nGetting started with tickets and processes\n\nBeginners guide to contributing and Jenkins Jira\n\nReviewing the developer section in jenkins.io is probably the best starting point, and a\nreference link to keep handy. The beginners guide to contributing to Jenkins\ncan also be useful, since it points to different repositories, tools (such as the issue tracker) and governance documents.\nBesides, it describes best practices for commit messages, code style conventions, PR guidelines, etc.\n\nOnce we get a general understanding of the former and want to actually start coding, we may get stuck trying to come up\nwith something to work on.\n\nVisiting the Jenkins issue tracker, feels like the natural next\nstep, since it is full of potential bugs and enhancements that have already been reported by the community. However, it\nis quite easy to feel overwhelmed by the possibilities listed there. Bear in mind that in a 10+-year-old project like\nthis, most of the things that are reported are tricky for a newcomer to work on. For that reason, filtering by\nnewbie-friendly tickets is probably\nthe best idea.\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot displaying the list of newbie-friendly tickets in the Jenkins Jira\n\nSelecting a ticket\n\nIn my case, I spent some time reviewing the newbie-friendly tickets, until I found one\nthat seemed interesting to me and also looked like something I would be able to fix:\n\nFigure 2. Screenshot of the ticket I decided to work on\n\nProcesses\n\nAt this stage, when we have decided to take ownership of a ticket, it’s a good practice to let the rest of the community\nknow that we are planning to start working on it. We can do so easily, by assigning the ticket to ourselves (see the\n“ Assign ” button below the ticket summary).\n\nAssigning the ticket to ourselves in the Jenkins Jira will allow any other contributors to know that we are planning to\ntake care of the ticket; and in case they are also interested in contributing to it, they will know who to reach if they\nwant to coordinate work or ask for status. That said, it is worth mentioning that assigning a ticket to yourself does\nnot mean that other contributors cannot work on it from then onwards. Jenkins is an open-source project and anyone is\nwelcome to create their own PRs, so anybody can propose their own solution to the ticket. But as you can guess, if the\nticket is assigned to somebody, most people will probably reach the assignee before starting to work on it.\n\nRelated to the former, it is also important to bear in mind that we should not postpone work on the ticket for too long\nonce we have assigned the ticket to ourselves. Other potential contributors might be ignoring the ticket because they\nsee yourself assigned to it.\n\nOnce we are about to actually start working on the ticket, it is also a good practice to click the “ Start Progress ”\nbutton. This action will change the status to “ In progress ”, signaling to the community that we are currently working\non this particular ticket.\n\nSetting up the necessary stuff on our computer\n\nConfiguring, installing and testing\n\nAs described in the first article of this journey, the\ninitial step to start contributing to a particular repository is to fork it to our GitHub account, and then clone it to\nour local computer.\n\nAs usual, in the Jenkins core repository the CONTRIBUTING file\ndescribes the necessary steps to get the repository working locally. This includes installing the necessary development\ntools: Java Development Kit ( OpenJDK is the recommended choice), Maven and any IDE supporting\nMaven projects. Note that instructions to install JDK and Maven are linked in the contributing guidelines.\n\nOnce we have all the necessary tools installed and configured, we are ready to build Jenkins locally\nand also to run tests.\n\nGetting down to business\n\nReviewing ticket details\n\nNow that I was ready to start working on the ticket, I had to review it in more detail, to fully understand the problem.\n\nThe description of the ticket I was planning to work on included two links. The first one was to\na screenshot that showed the actual bug. It showed\nhow several non-compatible plugins were being selected when clicking “ All ”, even though the intended behavior was to\nonly select the compatible plugins. The second link was a reference to a code fragment\nthat showed other validations that had to be taken into account when checking if a plugin update was compatible or not\nwith the current installation.\n\nReproducing the issue locally\n\nEven though I had now understood the issue in better detail, I had not seen it myself live yet, so it seemed to me that\nthe next logical step was to reproduce it locally.\n\nTo reproduce the issue locally in our computer, we can either use the local war file that we can generate by\nbuilding Jenkins from the source code\nor we can download the latest Jenkins version available and run it locally. When I worked\non this ticket, the latest available version was 2.172 and, when I built if from the sources I saw version 2.173-SNAPSHOT,\nwhich was the next version, in which the community was already working on.\n\nIn general it is a good idea to reproduce bugs locally, not only to get a better understanding, but also to make sure\nthey are actual issues. It could always be an issue happening only on the reporter’s end (e.g. some user misconfiguration).\nOr it could be a ticket referencing an old issue that has been fixed already. This latest possibility didn’t sound that\nstrange to me, since the ticket was one month old. It could have been handled by someone else in the meantime, without\nnoticing the ticket existed. Or the contributor might have forgotten to update the ticket in the issue tracker after the\nfix was committed.\n\nSo, for all the reasons above, I ran the latest Jenkins version locally. From a terminal, I went to the\nfolder in which the war file was placed, and ran java -jar jenkins.war, which starts Jenkins locally on http://localhost:8080.\n\nFrom the home page I navigated to the Plugin Manager (clicking the “ Manage Jenkins ” link in the left hand side and\nthen selecting “ Manage Plugins ” in the list).\n\nIn the Manage Plugins page, the list of plugin updates appears. In my case, since I re-used an old JENKINS_HOME\nfrom an older installation, several plugins showed up in the list, requiring updates. That allowed me to test the behavior\nthat was supposed to be failing.\n\nWhen I clicked on the “Select all” option at the bottom, this is what I got:\n\nFigure 3. Screenshot showing the error, reproduced locally, after clicking “Select All”\n\nAs it had been reported in the ticket, the behavior was inconsistent. In a previous version, the behavior of the “ All ”\nselector had been changed (with the best intent), aiming to only check the compatible plugins. However, as can be seen\nin the screenshot, the behavior was not the expected one. Now, neither “all” nor “only compatible” plugins were being\nselected, since some plugins with compatibility issues were also being checked, unintentionally.\n\nFiguring out a fix\n\nWhen reading the conversation in the original PR in which the behavior of the “ All ” selector had been changed, I saw a\nsuggestion of having a separate “ Compatible ” selector, thus leaving the “ All ” selector with the traditional behavior.\nI liked the idea, so I decided to include it as part of my proposed change.\n\nAt this stage, I had a clear picture of the different things I needed to change. These included: 1) The UI, to add a new\nselector for “Compatible” plugins only, 2) the JS code that applied the changes to the interface when the selectors were\nclicked and 3) probably the back-end method that was determining if a plugin was compatible or not.\n\nApplying the change\n\nAs usual, and as it is also recommended in the contributing guidelines, I created a separate feature branch to work on\nthe ticket.\n\nAfter reviewing the code, I spent some time figuring out which pieces I needed to change, both in the back-end and also\nin the front-end. For more details about the changes I had to make, you can take a look at the changes in my PR.\n\nAs a basic summary, I learned that the classic Jenkins UI was built using Jelly\nand, after understanding its basics, I modified the index.jelly file to include the new selector, assigning the\nfunction that checked the compatible plugins to this new selector, and re-using the existing “toggle” function to set\nall checkboxes to true in the case of “ All ”. I also had to modify the behavior of the checkPluginsWithoutWarnings\nJavaScript function, to un-check the incompatible ones, since there was now an actual “ All ” selector that was not there\npreviously, and that un-check case was not being taken into account. Then, I created a new back-end Java method\nisCompatible, inside the UpdateSite.java class, which now calls all the different methods that check different\ncompatibilities and returns the combined boolean result. For this change, I included an automated test to verify the\ncorrect behavior of the method, contributing to the test coverage of the project. Finally, I modified the table.jelly\nfile to call the new back-end method from the UI, replacing the existing one that was not taking all cases into account.\n\nAs you can see, the change involved touching different technologies, but even if you face a similar situation in which\nyou are not familiar with some of them, my advice would be carry on, don’t let that stop you. As software engineers, we\nshould focus on our evergreen skills, rather than on knowing\nspecific technologies; adapting to whatever framework we have to use at a given moment, learning whatever we need about\nthe new technology to complete the task and applying cross-framework principles and best practices to provide a quality\nsolution.\n\nResult\n\nAfter the changes described above, the resulting UI includes a new option, and the corresponding behaviors of the three\nselectors work as expected:\n\nFigure 4. Screenshot of the new version, displaying the behavior achieved by clicking the new “Compatible” selector\n\nPublishing the change\n\nSubmitting a Pull Request\n\nIn the contributing guidelines of the Jenkins core repository there is also a section about proposing changes,\nwhich describes the necessary steps that have to be followed in order to create a Pull Request (PR) with our change.\n\nFurthermore, there is a PR template in\nthe repository, which will be loaded automatically when creating a new PR and that will serve as a basis for us to provide\nthe necessary information for the reviewers. We are expected to: include a link to the ticket, list the proposed changelog\nentries describing our changes, complete the submitter checklist and add mentions to the desired reviewers (if any).\n\nIn my case, I followed the template when creating my PR,\ncompleting all sections. I linked the Jira ticket, provided two proposed changelog entries, completed the submitter\nchecklist and added three desired reviewers (explaining why I thought their reviews would be valuable). I also linked\nthe original PR that was referenced in the ticket, to provide further context.\n\nFigure 5. Screenshot of the PR I submitted\n\nThe approve and merge process\n\nAs stated in the contributing guidelines, typically two approvals are needed for the PR to be merged; and it can take\nfrom a few days to a couple of weeks to get them. Sometimes, one approval from a reviewer and a 1-week delay without\nextra reviews is considered enough to set the PR as ready-for-merge. However, both the time-to-merge and the number\nof approvals necessary might vary, depending on the complexity of the change or the area of Jenkins core that it affects.\n\nAfter the necessary approvals have been received, a Jenkins core maintainer will set the PR as ready-for-merge, which\nwill lead to it being merged into the master branch when one of the following releases are being prepared.\n\nIn my case, I received a review by Daniel (the reporter of the ticket and one of my “desired reviewers”) the very day I\nsubmitted the PR (April 14th). He made several very useful suggestions, which led to changes from my side. After those\nchanges, Daniel made minor remarks and my PR got another review, which was its first approval. After a week had passed\nwithout further news, I added the remaining minor suggestions from Daniel and a few days later received another approval,\nto which Daniel’s final approval was added, leading the PR to be labeled ready-for-merge, being later merged the same\nday (April 26th).\n\nFigure 6. Screenshot of the final state of the PR, after being merged\n\nRelease\n\nFor every new release, repository maintainers will select a set of PRs that have already been labeled ready-for-merge,\nmerge them to master, prepare changelogs (often using the suggestions included in the PRs by the authors) and proceed with\nthe creation of the new release. There is no additional action required from Pull Request authors at this point.\n\nEvery week a new version of Jenkins is released, so when your PR is merged, your changes will—​most likely—​become part\nof the following weekly release of Jenkins.\n\nEventually, your changes will also reach the Long-term support (LTS) release, which is\na different release line, aimed for more conservative users. This release line gets synced with the weekly release by\npicking, every 12 weeks, a relatively recent weekly release as baseline for the new LTS release. In between, intermediate\nLTS releases are created only to include important bug fixes, cherry-picked from the weekly releases. New features are\ntypically delayed until the next baseline for the LTS release is defined.\n\nRegarding the example described in this post, it was released in Jenkins 2.175 (weekly release), soon after being\nmerged. And will probably be included in the next LTS, which should be released next month (June 2019).\n\nDone!\n\nAnd that’s it! We have now covered the whole lifecycle of a new proposed change to Jenkins core. We have reviewed the\nprocess from the very beginning, picking a ticket from the Jenkins issue tracker; all the way to the end, having our\nchange released in a new Jenkins version.\n\nIf you have never contributed but are willing to do so, I hope this article motivates you to go back to the list of\nnewbie-friendly tickets, find one that looks interesting to you, and follow the steps described above, until you see\nyour own change released in a new Jenkins version.\n\nRemember, don’t try to solve a complicated issue as your first ticket, there are plenty of easier ways in which you can\ncontribute, and every little helps!","title":"Becoming a Jenkins contributor: Newbie-friendly tickets","tags":["jenkins","community","developer","contributing","newcomer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/ff5b9/romenrg.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/3af71/romenrg.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/1e7bb/romenrg.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/ff5b9/romenrg.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/7b60f/romenrg.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/bf13b/romenrg.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/9edd6/romenrg.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/f5f75/romenrg.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/ff962/romenrg.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":142}}},"blog":"https://www.romenrg.com","github":"romenrg","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Romén is a lifelong learner, software engineer and former digital entrepreneur.
