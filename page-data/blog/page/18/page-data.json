We are working on adding support\nfor Multi-branch\nPipeline Jobs and Folder Organisation in GitLab. The plan is to create the following\nplugins:\n\nGitLab API Plugin - Wraps GitLab Java APIs.\n\nGitLab Branch Source Plugin - Contains two packages:\n\nio.jenkins.plugins.gitlabserverconfig - Manages server configuration and web hooks management.\nIdeally should reside inside another plugin with name GitLab Plugin. In future, this package should\nbe moved into a new plugin.\n\nio.jenkins.plugins.gitlabbranchsource - Adds GitLab Branch Source for Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs (including\nMerge Requests) and Folder organisation.\n\nPresent State\n\nFreeStyle Job and Pipeline(Single Branch) Job are fully supported.\n\nMulti-branch Pipeline Job is partially supported (no MRs detection).\n\nGitLab Folder Organisation is not supported.\n\nGoals of this project\n\nImplement a lightweight GitLab Plugin that depends on GitLab API Plugin.\n\nFollow convention of 3 separate plugins i.e. GitLab Plugin, GitLab API Plugin, GitLab Branch Source Plugin.\n\nImplement GitLab Branch Source Plugin with support for Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs.\n\nSupport new Jenkins features such as\nJenkins Code as Configuration (JCasC),\nIncremental Tools.\n\nClear & Efficient design.\n\nSupport new SCM Trait APIs.\n\nSupport Java 8 and above.\n\nBuilding the plugin\n\nNo binaries are available for this plugin as the plugin is in the very early alpha stage, and not ready for the general\npublic quite yet.  If you want to jump in early, you can try building it yourself from source.\n\nInstallation:\n\nCheckout source code to your local machine:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/baymac/gitlab-branch-source-plugin.git\n\ncd gitlab-branch-source-plugin\n\nInstall the plugin:\n\nmvn clean install\n\nmvn clean install -DskipTests # to skip tests\n\nRun the plugin:\n\nmvn hpi:run # runs a Jenkins instance at localhost:8080\n\nmvn hpi:run -Djetty.port= # to run on your desired port number\n\nIf you want to test it with your Jenkins server, after mvn clean install follow these steps in your Jenkins instance:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Manage Plugins\n\nSelect Advanced tab\n\nIn Upload Plugin section, select Choose file\n\nSelect $ /target/gitlab-branch-source.hpi\n\nSelect Upload\n\nSelect Install without restart\n\nUsage\n\nAssuming plugin installation has done been already.\n\nSetting up GitLab Server Configuration on Jenkins\n\nOn jenkins, select Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Configure System\n\nScroll down to find the GitLab section\n\nSelect Add GitLab Server | Select GitLab Server\n\nNow you will now see the GitLab Server Configuration options.\n\nThere are 4 fields that needs to be configured:\n\nName - Plugin automatically generates an unique server name for you. User may want to configure this field\nto suit their needs but should make sure it is sufficiently unique. We recommend to keep it as it is.\n\nServer URL - Contains the URL to your GitLab Server. By default it is set to \"https://gitlab.com\". User can\nmodify it to enter their GitLab Server URL e.g. https://gitlab.gnome.org/, http://gitlab.example.com:7990. etc.\n\nCredentials - Contains a list of credentials entries that are of type GitLab Personal Access Token. When\nno credential has been added it shows \"-none-\". User can add a credential by clicking \"Add\" button.\n\nWeb Hook - This field is a checkbox. If you want the plugin to setup a webhook on your GitLab project(s)\nrelated jobs, check this box. The plugin listens to a URL for the concerned GitLab project(s) and when an event\noccurs in the GitLab Server, the server sends an event trigger to the URL where the web hook is setup. If you\nwant continuous integration (or continuous delivery) on your GitLab project then you may want to automatically\nset it up.\n\nAdding a Personal Access Token Credentials (To automatically generate Personal Access Token see\nnext section):\n\nUser is required to add a GitLab Personal Access Token type credentials entry to securely persist the token\ninside Jenkins.\n\nGenerate a Personal Access Token on your GitLab Server:\n\nSelect profile dropdown menu from top-right corner\n\nSelect Settings\n\nSelect Access Token from left column\n\nEnter a name | Set Scope to api, read_user, read_repository\n\nSelect Create Personal Access Token\n\nCopy the token generated\n\nReturn to Jenkins | Select Add in Credentials field | Select Jenkins\n\nSet Kind to GitLab Personal Access Token\n\nEnter Token\n\nEnter a unique id in ID\n\nEnter a human readable description\n\nSelect Add\n\nTesting connection:\n\nSelect your desired token in the Credentials dropdown\n\nSelect Test Connection\n\nIt should return something like Credentials verified for user\n\nSelect Apply (at the bottom)\n\nGitLab Server is now setup on Jenkins\n\nCreating Personal Access Token within Jenkins\n\nAlternatively, users can generate a GitLab Personal Access Token within Jenkins itself and automatically add the\nGitLab Personal Access Token credentials to Jenkins server credentials.\n\nSelect Advanced at the bottom of GitLab Section\n\nSelect Manage Additional GitLab Actions\n\nSelect Convert login and password to token\n\nSet the GitLab Server URL\n\nThere are 2 options to generate token;\n\nFrom credentials - To select an already persisting Username Password Credentials or add an Username Password\ncredential to persist it.\n\nFrom login and password - If this is a one time thing then you can directly enter you credentials to the text boxes\nand the username/password credential is not persisted.\n\nAfter setting your username/password credential, select Create token credentials.\n\nThe token creator will create a Personal Access Token in your GitLab Server for the given user with the\nrequired scope and also create a credentials for the same inside Jenkins server. You can go back to the GitLab Server\nConfiguration to select the new credentials generated (select \"-none-\" first then new credentials will appear). For\nsecurity reasons this token is not revealed as plain text rather returns an id. It is a 128-bit long UUID-4 string\n(36 characters).\n\nConfiguration as Code\n\nNo need for messing around in the UI. Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) or simply Configuration as Code Plugin\nallows you to configure Jenkins via a yaml file. If you are a first time user, you can learn more about JCasC\nhere.\n\nAdd configuration YAML:\n\nThere are multiple ways to load JCasC yaml file to configure Jenkins:\n\nJCasC by default searches for a file with the name jenkins.yaml in $JENKINS_ROOT.\n\nThe JCasC looks for an environment variable CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG which contains the path\nfor the configuration yaml file.\n\nA path to a folder containing a set of config files e.g. /var/jenkins_home/casc_configs.\n\nA full path to a single file e.g. /var/jenkins_home/casc_configs/jenkins.yaml.\n\nA URL pointing to a file served on the web e.g. /jenkins.yaml\" class=\"bare\">https:// /jenkins.yaml .\n\nYou can also set the configuration yaml path in the UI. Go to /configuration-as-code.\nEnter path or URL to jenkins.yaml and select Apply New Configuration.\n\nAn example of configuring GitLab server via jenkins.yaml :\n\ncredentials:\n  system:\n    domainCredentials:\n      - credentials:\n          - gitlabPersonalAccessToken:\n              scope: SYSTEM\n              id: \"i<3GitLab\"\n              token: \"XfsqZvVtAx5YCph5bq3r\" # gitlab personal access token\n\nunclassified:\n  gitLabServers:\n    servers:\n      - credentialsId: \"i<3GitLab\"\n        manageHooks: true\n        name: \"gitlab.com\"\n        serverUrl: \"https://gitlab.com\"\n\nFor better security, see handling secrets\nsection in JCasC\ndocumentation.\n\nFuture Scope of work\n\nThe second phase of GSoC will be utilized to develop GitLab Branch Source. The new feature is a work in progress, but\nthe codebase is unstable and requires lot of bugfixes. Some features like Multibranch Pipeline Jobs are functioning\nproperly. More about it at the end of second phase.\n\nIssue Tracking\n\nThis project uses Jenkins JIRA to track issues. You can file issues under\ngitlab-branch-source-plugin component.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis plugin is built and maintained by the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Team for\nMulti-branch Pipeline\nSupport for GitLab.

To make our job a bit easier,\nwe chose Java Microbenchmark Harness for running these benchmarks. This\nallows us to reliably measure performance of our time-critical functions and will help make Jenkins perform faster\nfor everyone.\n\nThe micro-benchmarking framework was recently released in the Jenkins Unit Test Harness 2.50.\nThe blog post below shows how to run benchmarks in your plugins.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe framework runs works by starting a temporary Jenkins instance for each fork of the JMH benchmark,\njust like JenkinsRule from Jenkins Test Harness. Benchmarks are run directly from your JUnit Tests which allows\nyou to fail builds on the fly and easily run benchmarks from your IDE, just like unit tests. You can easily\nconfigure your benchmarks by either using your Java methods, or by using Jenkins Configuration-as-Code plugin\nand passing the path to your YAML file.\n\nTo run benchmarks from your plugins, you need to do the following:\n\nbump up the minimum required Jenkins version to 2.60.3 or above\n\nbump Plugin-POM to a version ≥ 3.46 or manually upgrade to Jenkins Test Harness ≥ 2.51.\n\nNow, to run the benchmarks, you need to have a benchmark runner that contains a @Test so it can run\nlike a JUnit test. From inside a test method, you can use the OptionsBuilder provided by JMH to\nconfigure your benchmarks. For example:\n\npublic class BenchmarkRunner {\n    @Test\n    public void runJmhBenchmarks() throws Exception {\n        ChainedOptionsBuilder options = new OptionsBuilder()\n                .mode(Mode.AverageTime)\n                .forks(2)\n                .result(\"jmh-report.json\");\n\n        // Automatically detect benchmark classes annotated with @JmhBenchmark\n        new BenchmarkFinder(getClass()).findBenchmarks(options);\n        new Runner(options.build()).run();\n    }\n}\n\nSample benchmarks\n\nNow, you can write your first benchmark:\n\nWithout any special setup\n\n@JmhBenchmark\npublic class JmhStateBenchmark {\n    public static class MyState extends JmhBenchmarkState {\n    }\n\n    @Benchmark\n    public void benchmark(MyState state) {\n        // benchmark code goes here\n        state.getJenkins().setSystemMessage(\"Hello world\");\n    }\n}\n\nUsing Configuration as Code\n\nTo use configuration as code, apart from the dependencies above you also need to add the following\nto your pom.xml :\n\nio.jenkins\nconfiguration-as-code\n1.21\ntrue\n\nio.jenkins\nconfiguration-as-code\n1.21\ntests\ntest\n\nNow configuring a benchmark is as simple as providing path to your YAML file and specifying the class\ncontaining the benchmark state.\n\n@JmhBenchmark\npublic class SampleBenchmark {\n    public static class MyState extends CascJmhBenchmarkState {\n        @NonNull\n        @Override\n        protected String getResourcePath() {\n            return \"config.yml\";\n        }\n\n        @NonNull\n        @Override\n        protected Class getEnclosingClass() {\n            return SampleBenchmark.class;\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Benchmark\n    public void benchmark(MyState state) {\n        Jenkins jenkins = state.getJenkins(); // jenkins is configured and ready to be benchmarked.\n        // your benchmark code goes here...\n    }\n}\n\nMore Samples\n\nAs a part of this project, a few benchmarks have been created in the Role Strategy Plugin which show\nconfiguring the instances for various situations. You can find them\nhere.\n\nRunning Benchmarks\n\nRunning benchmarks from Maven\n\nTo easily run benchmarks from Maven, a Maven profile to run the benchmarks has been created\nand is available starting Plugin-POM version 3.45. You can then run your benchmarks from the\ncommand line using mvn test -Dbenchmark.\n\nRunning benchmarks on ci.jenkins.io\n\nIf you have your plugins hosted on ci.jenkins.io, you can easily run benchmarks directly from your Jenkinsfile\nby using the runBenchmarks() method after the buildPlugin() step in your which is now available in\nJenkins Pipeline library.\nThis function also accepts the path to your generated JMH benchmark reports as an optional\nparameter and archives the benchmark results. Running benchmarks in pull request builds allows you to constantly\nmonitor the performance implications of a given change. For example, the Jenkinsfile from Role Strategy Plugin:\n\nbuildPlugin()\nrunBenchmarks('jmh-report.json')\n\nVisualizing benchmark results\n\nBenchmark reports generated (in JSON) can be visualized using the either the JMH Report Plugin\nor by passing the benchmark reports to the JMH visualizer web service. As an example, here is\na visualized report of some benchmarks from the Role Strategy Plugin:\n\nThese improvements seen above were obtained through a small pull request\nto the plugin and shows how even seemingly small changes can bring major performance improvements. Microbenchmarks\nhelp to find these hot-spots and estimate the impact of changes.\n\nSome tips and tricks\n\nSince BenchmarkRunner class name in the example above does not qualify as a test according to Maven surefire plugin’s\nnaming conventions, the benchmarks will not interfere with your JUnit tests.\n\nBenchmark methods need to be annotated by @Benchmark for JMH to detect them.\n\nClasses containing benchmarks are found automatically by the BenchmarkFinder\nwhen annotated with @JmhBenchmark.\n\nA reference to the Jenkins instance is available through either JmhBenchmarkState#getJenkins() or through\nJenkins.getInstance() like you would otherwise do.\n\nJmhBenchmarkState provides setup() and tearDown() methods which can be overridden to configure the\nJenkins instance according to your benchmark’s requirements.\n\nThe benchmark builds on ci.jenkins.io are currently throttled because of the limited availability of highmem nodes.\n\nThe benchmark framework was made available in Jenkins Test Harness 2.50, it is recommended to use version 2.51 as it includes some bug fixes.\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nIf you have any feedback, comments or questions, please feel free to reach out to me through either\nthe Role Strategy Plugin Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list.\n\nPresentation slides\n\nDemo at Platform SIG meeting\n\nDocumentation for the micro-benchmark framework:\n\nWriting benchmarks (Jenkins Test Harness)\n\nPreconfiguring benchmarks using JCasC\n\nRunning benchmarks using Plugin POM profile\n\nBuild Step for running benchmarks on ci.jenkins.io","title":"Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins","tags":["jmh","plugins","benchmark","performance","developer","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"AbhyudayaSharma","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Abhyudaya is a Computer Science student at Shiv Nadar University, India.\nHe is participating in Google Summer of Code 2019 to improve the performance\nof the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin\">Role Strategy Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"abhyudayasharma","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Abhyudaya Sharma","slug":"blog/author/abhyudayasharma","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","id":"42277358-8fb3-53f2-a4d7-e57be525c9e9","slug":"/blog/2019/06/03/DevOps-World-Jenkins-World-2019-San-Francisco-Agenda-is-Live/","strippedHtml":"We are a little over two months away from the largest Jenkins gathering of the year.  From Jenkins users, to maintainers, contributors, mentors and those new to Jenkins this event will have something for everyone.\n\nThis year’s DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco has moved to a larger venue to facilitate the growth. From August 12 - 15, 2019 the event will take place at the Moscone West Center.  The event boasts 100+ sessions, and will offer training, hands-on workshops, onsite certification, contributor summit and much more.  Conference attendees can expect to be inspired while learning the latest innovations from industry leaders. Attendees will learn the value that digital transformation has in delivering software more efficiently, more quickly and with higher quality.\n\nWe are excited to announce most of the agenda for DevOps World Jenkins World San Francisco is now live. We will continue to fill out the agenda with more sessions, trainings/workshops, and activities. Below is a small sampling of sessions from some of our favorite Jenkins contributors:\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code: try it & start contributing! - Ewelina Wilkosz\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code is an open source Jenkins plugin that allows users to keep complete Jenkins configuration in a simple configuration file (yaml format). In the talk, I’ll briefly present the history of the plugin, the vision for the future and current status. Then I’ll move to the demo section where I’ll show how easy it is to configure and run Jenkins with the help of the plugin.\n\nThinking about Jenkins Security - Mark Waite & Wadeck Follonier\n\nJenkins security concepts, authorization, authentication and auditing, secure builds, agent security, configuration and administration security, auditing, and security best practices.\n\nDocker and Jenkins [as Code] - Dr. Oleg Nenashev\n\nThe Configuration as Code plugin is a new milestone which enables managing Jenkins configurations via YAML. Together with Docker, this plugin offers many ways to produce ready-to-fly Jenkins images for any environments. In my talk, I will describe official controller and agent images offered by the Jenkins project. What’s inside them? How do you configure images with JCasC and Groovy hooks? How do you use these approaches together? And, finally, how do you simplify packaging of custom Jenkins images and define the entire system [as code]?\n\nCan Jenkins be the Engine of Mobile DevOps? - Shashikant Jagtap\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the following topics:\n\nHow mobile DevOps is different than web DevOps\n\nChallenges in mobile DevOps ( iOS and Android)\n\nHow Jenkins fits in mobile DevOps and CI/CD pipelines\n\nWhat Jenkins misses for mobile\n\nHow we can make Jenkins better for mobile apps\n\nCreating a CI/CD Pipeline for Your Shared Libraries - Roderick Randolph\n\nAt Capital One we run tens of thousands of CI/CD pipelines on Jenkins, leveraging the Jenkins Pipeline shared libraries extension to enable code reuse and decrease time to market for dev teams. A code change to our shared library goes live immediately and is consumed the next time a team triggers their project’s pipeline. So, why do we have such high confidence that a code change to our library won’t break a team’s pipeline? The answer: we’ve developed a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for our shared library.\n\nDuring this talk, you will learn how to create a fully automated pipeline for your shared libraries including how to develop tests, create canary releases, monitor for issues and quickly rollback changes to your shared library to achieve rapid delivery while minimizing any impact on dev teams.\n\nHow Jenkins Builds and Delivers Jenkins in the Cloud - Brian Benz & Tyler Croy\n\nWant to know how Jenkins builds Jenkins? Catch this session to see the real-life implementation of Jenkins’ development (at ci.jenkins.io) and delivery infrastructure in the cloud as it evolved from a mix of platforms to multi-platform VMs, containers and Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure.  Expect a frank discussion of issues that were encountered along the way, how the architecture has evolved and what’s on the roadmap.  We’ll share important tips and tricks for implementing your own Jenkins infrastructure on any cloud, based on Jenkins’ own implementation experience.\n\nDeclarative Pipeline 2019: Tips, Tricks and What’s Next - Liam Newman\n\nAre you using Declarative Pipeline? Are you considering using them? Are you just curious? Well, we’re going to help you get more out of Declarative Pipeline with less complexity and less effort. We’ll walk through some best practices, point out some tricks you might not have known, warn you off some common mistakes, review what’s changed in the last year and give you a preview of what we’re working on for Declarative Pipeline going forward.\n\nSay Goodbye to Hello World, Say Hello to Real World Delivery Pipelines - Brian Benz & Jessica Deen\n\nAre you tired of \"Hello World\" and hypothetical demos? So are we! In this code-heavy, deeply technical session, you’ll learn more than just tips and tricks.  You’ll learn best practices and how to start from absolute zero. Whether you’re using Jenkins, Azure DevOps, a mixture of the two, or another CI/CD tool, you’ll learn how to create multiple build and release pipelines using real world code hosted on open source platforms such as GitHub.\n\nFor the complete agenda see DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco .\n\nFeel free to use discount code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.\n\nHope to see you there!","title":"DevOps World-Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco: Agenda is Live","tags":["event","devopsworldjenkinsworld2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"blog/author/alyssat","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","id":"0cba81fa-0a2a-5225-8fdf-6ce66f9aa4d5","slug":"/blog/2019/05/30/becoming-contributor-newbie-tickets/","strippedHtml":"Two months ago I published an introductory article on\nthe journey of becoming a Jenkins contributor. In that first article, the jenkins.io site was reviewed, learning about\nthe multiple ways in which we can participate and contribute. Then, a first—​basic—​contribution I made to the site\nrepository was described.\n\nNow, in this new article we will be exploring more advanced contributions, committing code to the actual Jenkins core.\n\nGetting started with tickets and processes\n\nBeginners guide to contributing and Jenkins Jira\n\nReviewing the developer section in jenkins.io is probably the best starting point, and a\nreference link to keep handy. The beginners guide to contributing to Jenkins\ncan also be useful, since it points to different repositories, tools (such as the issue tracker) and governance documents.\nBesides, it describes best practices for commit messages, code style conventions, PR guidelines, etc.\n\nOnce we get a general understanding of the former and want to actually start coding, we may get stuck trying to come up\nwith something to work on.\n\nVisiting the Jenkins issue tracker, feels like the natural next\nstep, since it is full of potential bugs and enhancements that have already been reported by the community. However, it\nis quite easy to feel overwhelmed by the possibilities listed there. Bear in mind that in a 10+-year-old project like\nthis, most of the things that are reported are tricky for a newcomer to work on. For that reason, filtering by\nnewbie-friendly tickets is probably\nthe best idea.\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot displaying the list of newbie-friendly tickets in the Jenkins Jira\n\nSelecting a ticket\n\nIn my case, I spent some time reviewing the newbie-friendly tickets, until I found one\nthat seemed interesting to me and also looked like something I would be able to fix:\n\nFigure 2. Screenshot of the ticket I decided to work on\n\nProcesses\n\nAt this stage, when we have decided to take ownership of a ticket, it’s a good practice to let the rest of the community\nknow that we are planning to start working on it. We can do so easily, by assigning the ticket to ourselves (see the\n“ Assign ” button below the ticket summary).\n\nAssigning the ticket to ourselves in the Jenkins Jira will allow any other contributors to know that we are planning to\ntake care of the ticket; and in case they are also interested in contributing to it, they will know who to reach if they\nwant to coordinate work or ask for status. That said, it is worth mentioning that assigning a ticket to yourself does\nnot mean that other contributors cannot work on it from then onwards. Jenkins is an open-source project and anyone is\nwelcome to create their own PRs, so anybody can propose their own solution to the ticket. But as you can guess, if the\nticket is assigned to somebody, most people will probably reach the assignee before starting to work on it.\n\nRelated to the former, it is also important to bear in mind that we should not postpone work on the ticket for too long\nonce we have assigned the ticket to ourselves. Other potential contributors might be ignoring the ticket because they\nsee yourself assigned to it.\n\nOnce we are about to actually start working on the ticket, it is also a good practice to click the “ Start Progress ”\nbutton. This action will change the status to “ In progress ”, signaling to the community that we are currently working\non this particular ticket.\n\nSetting up the necessary stuff on our computer\n\nConfiguring, installing and testing\n\nAs described in the first article of this journey, the\ninitial step to start contributing to a particular repository is to fork it to our GitHub account, and then clone it to\nour local computer.\n\nAs usual, in the Jenkins core repository the CONTRIBUTING file\ndescribes the necessary steps to get the repository working locally. This includes installing the necessary development\ntools: Java Development Kit ( OpenJDK is the recommended choice), Maven and any IDE supporting\nMaven projects. Note that instructions to install JDK and Maven are linked in the contributing guidelines.\n\nOnce we have all the necessary tools installed and configured, we are ready to build Jenkins locally\nand also to run tests.\n\nGetting down to business\n\nReviewing ticket details\n\nNow that I was ready to start working on the ticket, I had to review it in more detail, to fully understand the problem.\n\nThe description of the ticket I was planning to work on included two links. The first one was to\na screenshot that showed the actual bug. It showed\nhow several non-compatible plugins were being selected when clicking “ All ”, even though the intended behavior was to\nonly select the compatible plugins. The second link was a reference to a code fragment\nthat showed other validations that had to be taken into account when checking if a plugin update was compatible or not\nwith the current installation.\n\nReproducing the issue locally\n\nEven though I had now understood the issue in better detail, I had not seen it myself live yet, so it seemed to me that\nthe next logical step was to reproduce it locally.\n\nTo reproduce the issue locally in our computer, we can either use the local war file that we can generate by\nbuilding Jenkins from the source code\nor we can download the latest Jenkins version available and run it locally. When I worked\non this ticket, the latest available version was 2.172 and, when I built if from the sources I saw version 2.173-SNAPSHOT,\nwhich was the next version, in which the community was already working on.\n\nIn general it is a good idea to reproduce bugs locally, not only to get a better understanding, but also to make sure\nthey are actual issues. It could always be an issue happening only on the reporter’s end (e.g. some user misconfiguration).\nOr it could be a ticket referencing an old issue that has been fixed already. This latest possibility didn’t sound that\nstrange to me, since the ticket was one month old. It could have been handled by someone else in the meantime, without\nnoticing the ticket existed. Or the contributor might have forgotten to update the ticket in the issue tracker after the\nfix was committed.\n\nSo, for all the reasons above, I ran the latest Jenkins version locally. From a terminal, I went to the\nfolder in which the war file was placed, and ran java -jar jenkins.war, which starts Jenkins locally on http://localhost:8080.\n\nFrom the home page I navigated to the Plugin Manager (clicking the “ Manage Jenkins ” link in the left hand side and\nthen selecting “ Manage Plugins ” in the list).\n\nIn the Manage Plugins page, the list of plugin updates appears. In my case, since I re-used an old JENKINS_HOME\nfrom an older installation, several plugins showed up in the list, requiring updates. That allowed me to test the behavior\nthat was supposed to be failing.\n\nWhen I clicked on the “Select all” option at the bottom, this is what I got:\n\nFigure 3. Screenshot showing the error, reproduced locally, after clicking “Select All”\n\nAs it had been reported in the ticket, the behavior was inconsistent. In a previous version, the behavior of the “ All ”\nselector had been changed (with the best intent), aiming to only check the compatible plugins. However, as can be seen\nin the screenshot, the behavior was not the expected one. Now, neither “all” nor “only compatible” plugins were being\nselected, since some plugins with compatibility issues were also being checked, unintentionally.\n\nFiguring out a fix\n\nWhen reading the conversation in the original PR in which the behavior of the “ All ” selector had been changed, I saw a\nsuggestion of having a separate “ Compatible ” selector, thus leaving the “ All ” selector with the traditional behavior.\nI liked the idea, so I decided to include it as part of my proposed change.\n\nAt this stage, I had a clear picture of the different things I needed to change. These included: 1) The UI, to add a new\nselector for “Compatible” plugins only, 2) the JS code that applied the changes to the interface when the selectors were\nclicked and 3) probably the back-end method that was determining if a plugin was compatible or not.\n\nApplying the change\n\nAs usual, and as it is also recommended in the contributing guidelines, I created a separate feature branch to work on\nthe ticket.\n\nAfter reviewing the code, I spent some time figuring out which pieces I needed to change, both in the back-end and also\nin the front-end. For more details about the changes I had to make, you can take a look at the changes in my PR.\n\nAs a basic summary, I learned that the classic Jenkins UI was built using Jelly\nand, after understanding its basics, I modified the index.jelly file to include the new selector, assigning the\nfunction that checked the compatible plugins to this new selector, and re-using the existing “toggle” function to set\nall checkboxes to true in the case of “ All ”. I also had to modify the behavior of the checkPluginsWithoutWarnings\nJavaScript function, to un-check the incompatible ones, since there was now an actual “ All ” selector that was not there\npreviously, and that un-check case was not being taken into account. Then, I created a new back-end Java method\nisCompatible, inside the UpdateSite.java class, which now calls all the different methods that check different\ncompatibilities and returns the combined boolean result. For this change, I included an automated test to verify the\ncorrect behavior of the method, contributing to the test coverage of the project. Finally, I modified the table.jelly\nfile to call the new back-end method from the UI, replacing the existing one that was not taking all cases into account.\n\nAs you can see, the change involved touching different technologies, but even if you face a similar situation in which\nyou are not familiar with some of them, my advice would be carry on, don’t let that stop you. As software engineers, we\nshould focus on our evergreen skills, rather than on knowing\nspecific technologies; adapting to whatever framework we have to use at a given moment, learning whatever we need about\nthe new technology to complete the task and applying cross-framework principles and best practices to provide a quality\nsolution.\n\nResult\n\nAfter the changes described above, the resulting UI includes a new option, and the corresponding behaviors of the three\nselectors work as expected:\n\nFigure 4. Screenshot of the new version, displaying the behavior achieved by clicking the new “Compatible” selector\n\nPublishing the change\n\nSubmitting a Pull Request\n\nIn the contributing guidelines of the Jenkins core repository there is also a section about proposing changes,\nwhich describes the necessary steps that have to be followed in order to create a Pull Request (PR) with our change.\n\nFurthermore, there is a PR template in\nthe repository, which will be loaded automatically when creating a new PR and that will serve as a basis for us to provide\nthe necessary information for the reviewers. We are expected to: include a link to the ticket, list the proposed changelog\nentries describing our changes, complete the submitter checklist and add mentions to the desired reviewers (if any).\n\nIn my case, I followed the template when creating my PR,\ncompleting all sections. I linked the Jira ticket, provided two proposed changelog entries, completed the submitter\nchecklist and added three desired reviewers (explaining why I thought their reviews would be valuable). I also linked\nthe original PR that was referenced in the ticket, to provide further context.\n\nFigure 5. Screenshot of the PR I submitted\n\nThe approve and merge process\n\nAs stated in the contributing guidelines, typically two approvals are needed for the PR to be merged; and it can take\nfrom a few days to a couple of weeks to get them. Sometimes, one approval from a reviewer and a 1-week delay without\nextra reviews is considered enough to set the PR as ready-for-merge. However, both the time-to-merge and the number\nof approvals necessary might vary, depending on the complexity of the change or the area of Jenkins core that it affects.\n\nAfter the necessary approvals have been received, a Jenkins core maintainer will set the PR as ready-for-merge, which\nwill lead to it being merged into the master branch when one of the following releases are being prepared.\n\nIn my case, I received a review by Daniel (the reporter of the ticket and one of my “desired reviewers”) the very day I\nsubmitted the PR (April 14th). He made several very useful suggestions, which led to changes from my side. After those\nchanges, Daniel made minor remarks and my PR got another review, which was its first approval. After a week had passed\nwithout further news, I added the remaining minor suggestions from Daniel and a few days later received another approval,\nto which Daniel’s final approval was added, leading the PR to be labeled ready-for-merge, being later merged the same\nday (April 26th).\n\nFigure 6. Screenshot of the final state of the PR, after being merged\n\nRelease\n\nFor every new release, repository maintainers will select a set of PRs that have already been labeled ready-for-merge,\nmerge them to master, prepare changelogs (often using the suggestions included in the PRs by the authors) and proceed with\nthe creation of the new release. There is no additional action required from Pull Request authors at this point.\n\nEvery week a new version of Jenkins is released, so when your PR is merged, your changes will—​most likely—​become part\nof the following weekly release of Jenkins.\n\nEventually, your changes will also reach the Long-term support (LTS) release, which is\na different release line, aimed for more conservative users. This release line gets synced with the weekly release by\npicking, every 12 weeks, a relatively recent weekly release as baseline for the new LTS release. In between, intermediate\nLTS releases are created only to include important bug fixes, cherry-picked from the weekly releases. New features are\ntypically delayed until the next baseline for the LTS release is defined.\n\nRegarding the example described in this post, it was released in Jenkins 2.175 (weekly release), soon after being\nmerged. And will probably be included in the next LTS, which should be released next month (June 2019).\n\nDone!\n\nAnd that’s it! We have now covered the whole lifecycle of a new proposed change to Jenkins core. We have reviewed the\nprocess from the very beginning, picking a ticket from the Jenkins issue tracker; all the way to the end, having our\nchange released in a new Jenkins version.\n\nIf you have never contributed but are willing to do so, I hope this article motivates you to go back to the list of\nnewbie-friendly tickets, find one that looks interesting to you, and follow the steps described above, until you see\nyour own change released in a new Jenkins version.\n\nRemember, don’t try to solve a complicated issue as your first ticket, there are plenty of easier ways in which you can\ncontribute, and every little helps!","title":"Becoming a Jenkins contributor: Newbie-friendly tickets","tags":["jenkins","community","developer","contributing","newcomer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"https://www.romenrg.com","github":"romenrg","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Romén is a lifelong learner, software engineer and former digital entrepreneur.

Audit Log Plugin for Jenkins is an in development project to integrate standardized audit logging trails to various core actions in Jenkins.\nThis project integrates the recently released Apache Log4j Audit library to allow for a vast array of possible audit logging destinations and configuration.\nWe began this plugin not long after Log4j Audit 1.0.0 was released last year by partnering with Outreachy where we mentored two interns who laid the foundations of the project.\nThis year, we applied to Outreachy again to continue the project, and we were able to accept two more Outreachy interns: Aarthi Rajaraman and Gayathri Rajendar.\nBoth have already been adding new features and improving the plugin over the past couple months, and the internship officially began on 20 May.\n\nThis round has some ambitious goals of various features and documentation we wish to create.\nAfter having added audit log support for several built-in event listeners in Jenkins around the lifecycle of projects, builds, nodes, and authentication during both the previous internship and the applications to this one, we would like to accomplish the following:\n\nMake a 1.0 release of the plugin for the Jenkins Update Center. #34\n\nAdd documentation on supported audit log types and configuration options. #40\n\nAdd audit logs for credential usage and lifecycle events. #35, #36\n\nAdd audit logs for user property lifecycle events. #37\n\nDefine or document an API for other plugins to use to define and log their own audit events. #30\n\nEnsure audit log events use consistent vocabulary with the Jenkins UI. #33\n\nAdd an audit log event recorder/viewer comparable to the Jenkins logger recorder administrative UI. #32\n\nAdd support for configuring a syslog-compatible log server for writing audit logs. #29\n\nAdd support for configuring a relational database such as PostgreSQL for writing audit logs. #31\n\nImprove unit test coverage and pay down technical debt. #38\n\nBegin discovery on alternative ways to manage the underlying Log4j Core configuration such as via the upcoming integration with Spring Cloud Configuration. #39\n\nIn the future, we hope to participate with more projects and mentors.\nGoing on concurrently with Outreachy right now is Google Summer of Code 2019 where we are mentoring several more projects and students.\nPlease extend a

2017, I started to do some contributions to the Jenkins community. As a beginner, translation might be\nthe easiest way to help the project. You don’t need to understand the whole context, even to create a ticket in the\nissue tracker system.

So, sometimes my PRs\nare delayed from being merged into master.\n\nSome contributors told me that I can start a thread at the mailing list.

With multiple programming languages, automated testing frameworks, and security compliance tools being used by different applications within your organization, it becomes difficult to build and maintain pipelines for each team.\n\nMost pipelines are going to follow the same generic workflow regardless of which specific tech stack is employed by an application.  The Templating Engine Plugin (abbreviated as JTE for Jenkins Templating Engine) allows you to capture this efficiency by creating tool-agnostic, templated workflows to be reused by every team.\n\nAs technology consultants with clients in both the public and private sectors, at Booz Allen we found ourselves building DevSecOps pipelines from scratch for every new project.  Through developing the Jenkins Templating Engine, we’ve seen pipeline development decrease from months to days now that we can reuse tool integrations while bringing a new level of governance to Jenkins pipelines.\n\nPipeline Templating\n\nOrganizations benefit from letting application developers focus on what they do best: building applications. Supporting this means building a centralized DevOps team responsible for maintaining platform infrastructure and creating CI/CD pipelines utilized by development teams.\n\nWith the rise of microservice-based architectures, a centralized DevOps teams can support many different development teams simultaneously; all of whom may be leveraging different programming languages and automated testing tools.\n\nWhile the tools may differ between development teams, the workflow is often the same: unit test, static code analysis, build and publish an artifact, deploy it, and then perform different types of testing against the deployed application.\n\nThe Templating Engine Plugin allows you to remove the Jenkinsfile from each repository by defining a common workflow for teams to inherit.  Instead of an entire pipeline definition in each repository, teams supply a configuration file specifying which tools to use for the workflow.\n\nJTE in Action\n\nLet’s walk through a bare bones example to demonstrate the reusability of templates:\n\nExample Pipeline Template:\n\nunit_test()\nbuild()\nstatic_code_analysis()\n\nTemplates leverage Steps contributed by Libraries to outline a workflow teams must implement.  While a template does get executed just like any other Jenkinsfile (meaning that the standard scripted and declarative syntax is supported), the goal of a template should be to read like plain English and avoid any technical implementation.\n\nLeveraging templates in this way lets you separate the business logic (what should happen when) of your pipeline from the\ntechnical implementation (what’s actually going to happen).  The result of this is a CI/CD pipeline that’s proven to be\nsignificantly easier to manage when supporting multiple teams simultaneously.\n\nThe steps outlined by this template ( unit_test, build, and static_code_analysis) have been named generically on purpose. This way teams can specify different libraries to use while sharing the same pipeline.\n\nImplementing the Template\n\nImplementing a shareable pipeline with the Templating Engine requires a few key components:\n\nPipeline Template : Outline the workflow to be performed\n\nLibraries : Provide technical implementations of the steps of the workflow\n\nConfiguration Files : Specify which libraries to use and their configuration\n\nStep 1: Create a Pipeline Configuration Repository\n\nA Pipeline Configuration Repository is used to store common configurations and pipeline templates inherited by teams.\n\nThis example Pipeline Configuration Repository will later be configured as part of a Governance Tier : the mechanism in JTE that allows you to build hierarchical configurations representing your organization.\n\nA Governance Tier holds three things:\n\nPipeline Templates\n\nA list of Library Sources\n\nThe tier’s configuration file ( pipeline_config.groovy)\n\nThe pipeline templates and the configuration file for a Governance Tier are stored in the pipeline configuration repository.\n\nWhen configuring the Governance Tier in Jenkins, you will provide a source code management location for a repository that contains the above components as well as the base directory where these artifacts can be found.\n\nStep 2: Create the Pipeline Template\n\nNext, we’ll create a Jenkinsfile for the Governance Tier.  In JTE, the Jenkinsfile is the default pipeline template that an execution will use.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\nunit_test()\nbuild()\nstatic_code_analysis()\n\nStep 3: Create the Libraries\n\nThe Templating Engine Plugin has implemented a version of Jenkins Shared Libraries to enhance the reusability of libraries.  A library is a root directory within a source code repository that has been configured as a Library Source on a Governance Tier.\n\nIn our example, the pipeline template needs to perform unit testing, package an artifact, and run static code analysis.\n\nLet’s assume that we have some teams using gradle and some teams using maven to build and test their application but they will both use SonarQube to perform static code analysis.\n\nIn this scenario, we should create gradle, maven, and sonarqube libraries.\n\n|- gradle/\n  \\-- build.groovy\n  \\-- unit_test.groovy\n|- maven/\n  \\-- build.groovy\n  \\-- unit_test.groovy\n|- sonarqube/\n  \\-- static_code_analysis.groovy\n\nStep 4: Implement the Steps\n\nImplementing a library step is exactly the same as just writing regular global variables as part of the default Jenkins Shared Libraries.\n\nFor the purposes of this demonstration, we will just have each step print out the step name and contributing library.\n\ngradle/build.groovy\n\nvoid call(){\n    println \"gradle: build()\"\n}\n\nRead more about Library Development within JTE.\n\nStep 5: Create the Configuration Files\n\nThe configuration file for JTE is named pipeline_config.groovy.\n\nIn the Governance Tier we’ll create a configuration file specifying common configurations between the applications. In this case, both applications are using the sonarqube library:\n\npipeline_config.groovy\n\nlibraries{\n  merge = true // allow individual apps to contribute additional libraries\n  sonarqube\n}\n\nNext, we’ll create two more repositories representing the maven and gradle applications. Within those repositories all we’ll need is an application-specific pipeline_config.groovy file.\n\nThese repositories both contain an application pipeline_config.groovy configuration file.\n\nmaven app: pipeline_config.groovy\n\nlibraries{\n    maven\n}\n\ngradle app: pipeline_config.groovy\n\nlibraries{\n    gradle\n}\n\nStep 6: Configure the Governance Tier in Jenkins\n\nNow that we have a Pipeline Configuration Repository and a Library Source Repository, we can configure a Governance Tier in Jenkins:\n\nThis configuration shown in the image above can be found under Manage Jenkins >> Configure System\n\nThrough the Templating Engine, you can create a pipeline governance hierarchy matching your organization’s taxonomy by representing this structure via Folders in Jenkins.\n\nStep 7: Create a Multibranch Pipeline for Both Applications\n\nWhen creating Multibranch Pipeline Projects for each app, the Templating Engine plugin supplies a new Project Recognizer\ncalled Jenkins Templating Engine.  This sets the project to use the Templating Engine framework for all branches within the\nrepository.\n\nYou can also set the Jenkins Templating Engine project recognizer for a GitHub Organization project, enabling you to easily share the same pipeline across an entire Github Organization!\n\nStep 8: Run the Pipelines\n\nThat’s it!  Now, both applications will leverage the exact same pipeline template while having the flexibility to select which\ntools should be used during each phase of the workflow.\n\nBelow is sample output from the console log from both applications pipeline runs:\n\nGradle:\n\n[JTE] Obtained Template Configuration File pipeline_config.groovy from git https://github.com/steven-terrana/example-jte-configuration\n[JTE] Obtained Template Configuration File pipeline_config.groovy from git https://github.com/steven-terrana/example-jte-app-gradle.git\n[JTE] Loading Library sonarqube from git https://github.com/steven-terrana/example-jte-libraries.git\n[JTE] Loading Library gradle from git https://github.com/steven-terrana/example-jte-libraries.git\n...\n[JTE] Obtained Template Jenkinsfile from git https://github.com/steven-terrana/example-jte-configuration\n[JTE][Step - gradle/unit_test]\n[Pipeline] echo\ngradle: unit_test()\n[JTE][Step - gradle/build]\n[Pipeline] echo\ngradle: build()\n[JTE][Step - sonarqube/static_code_analysis]\n[Pipeline] echo\nsonarqube: static_code_analysis()\n[Pipeline] End of Pipeline\n\nMaven:\n\n[JTE] Obtained Template Configuration File pipeline_config.groovy from git https://github.com/steven-terrana/example-jte-configuration\n[JTE] Obtained Template Configuration File pipeline_config.groovy from git https://github.com/steven-terrana/example-jte-app-maven.git\n[JTE] Loading Library sonarqube from git https://github.com/steven-terrana/example-jte-libraries.git\n[JTE] Loading Library maven from git https://github.com/steven-terrana/example-jte-libraries.git\n...\n[JTE] Obtained Template Jenkinsfile from git https://github.com/steven-terrana/example-jte-configuration\n[JTE][Step - maven/unit_test]\n[Pipeline] echo\nmaven: unit_test()\n[JTE][Step - maven/build]\n[Pipeline] echo\nmaven: build()\n[JTE][Step - sonarqube/static_code_analysis]\n[Pipeline] echo\nsonarqube: static_code_analysis()\n[Pipeline] End of Pipeline\n\nBenefits of the Templating Engine\n\nApply Organizational Governance\n\nLeveraging the Templating Engine Plugin will allow you to define enterprise-scale, approved\nworkflows that can be used by teams regardless of what tools are being used.  This top-down\napproach makes scaling and enforcing DevSecOps principles significantly easier within your organization.\n\nOptimize Code Reuse\n\nThere’s really no need for every team in your organization to figure out how to do the same things over\nand over again.  At Booz Allen, we have seen pipeline development time decrease from months to days as\nwe have continuously reused and expanded upon our Templating Engine library portfolio as part of our Solutions\nDelivery Platform.\n\nSimplify Pipeline Maintainability\n\nOften DevOps engineers find themselves building and supporting pipelines for multiple development teams at\nthe same time.  By decoupling the workflow from the technical implementation and consolidating the pipeline\ndefinition to a centralized location, the Templating Engine plugin allows DevOps engineers to scale much faster.\n\nGet Involved!\n\nThe Templating Engine Plugin has been open sourced and made available in the Jenkins Update Center.\n\nWe always appreciate feedback and contributions!
