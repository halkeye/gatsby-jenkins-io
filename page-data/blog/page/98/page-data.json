Hyperic builds enterprise systems monitoring and management software and also contributes to a number of open source projects, many of which are built with Hudson.\n\nTo date I must say that Doug’s use of Hudson is one of the largest and more impressive installations I’ve seen. I don’t want to spoil the interview, but they’re testing on platforms that don’t even run Java. Madness! If you think you can out-do him, you can find my email information at the bottom of the interview, I’d love to hear about it!\n\nWithout further ado, Doug from SpringSource.\n\nDoug We started using Hudson in early 2008 to automate the build and testing of our SIGAR library.  The SIGAR API implements a portable interface in C for gathering system information related to memory, processors, file systems, network interfaces, network connection tables, the process table and more.  We support dozens of OS + version + architecture combinations, along with several language bindings.  SIGAR is a key component of the Hyperic HQ agent and is used in other projects including Hypertable, Terracotta, GridGain and MySQL enterprise.\n\nHudson Was SpringSource using continuous integration before Hudson? If so, what caused you guys to switch?\n\nDoug The SIGAR project actually started back in late 2002 and our initial CI system for the project was a good old-fashioned Perl script / ssh for-loop.  It was good enough to get by in the early years, but a proper replacement was long overdue.  We were (and still are) using Bamboo to build and test Hyperic HQ.  We looked at using Bamboo for SIGAR, but at the time the \"Remote Agent\" feature was new to Bamboo and was not in the version we were running. Rather than disrupt HQ’s CI along with taking on an additional licensing cost, we gave Hudson a shot and haven’t looked back.\n\nHudson Might be a bit of personal bias, but I think you guys made the right choice there! Checking out the public Hudson server, I see that SpringSource is building/testing products on AIX, the BSDs, various flavors of Linux, Solaris, Windows and Mac OS X, what kinds of languages/build systems are being built by Hudson? How varied are the environments that Hudson executes jobs in?\n\nDoug And HP-UX! The matrix of SIGAR’s supported OS + kernel version + architecture + distribution is north of 100 combinations.  So, Hudson is covering a very heterogeneous collection of systems with most jobs tied to a specific node.  Our primary focus has been the C API and Java JNI bindings, using an Ant based build system and a JUnit test suite.  SIGAR also has language bindings for Perl, Ruby, Python, Erlang, PHP, C# and Lua.  So, Hudson is also driving each language’s extension build system of choice, respectively: MakeMaker, Rake, distutils, emake, phpize, Nant and autotools.\n\nHudson What do you consider to be noteworthy about your Hudson implementation? Besides, clearly, that you’re running Hudson agents on just about every OS that will run Java :)\n\nDoug The majority of our x86/x64 nodes are virtualized on VMware ESX and VMware Server.  We also have a fine collection of PPC, PA-RISC and Sparc hardware in house, with IA-64 and s390x hosted elsewhere by third parties.  Some of these systems are too old to support Java 1.5 and/or Git.  As a simple work-around, the nodes share an NFS workspace where the agent node takes care of 'SCM' and 'Post-build Actions', but the 'Build' step in between is invoked via ssh. The SIGAR distribution includes about two dozen native binaries that are compatible with most of the supported platform matrix.  There’s a Hudson job for each Git branch that rolls these binaries into a release bundle. Another job flavor uses the Hudson URL SCM plugin to download and unit test the binary releases on the rest of the platform matrix.  This is key to testing binary compatibility.  Similar for the collectd project, each Git branch has a job that runs automake, autoconf, etc. and 'make dist' into the collectd release flavor tarball.  So a push to git.verplant.org by octo in Germany triggers an update of the collectd release artifact, which in turn triggers the URL SCM jobs to download the tarball, unpack and build over here at our west coast locations. We have four Hudson servers in different locations, three of which are managing most of the jobs behind firewalls.  Select jobs use the Build Publisher plugin to post the job and its artifacts to our public Hudson server. This makes it easy for us to provide platform specific bug fixes in binary form, share build logs with external projects and host a central repository of artifacts reachable by all of the URL SCM based jobs. Our public Hudson server also provides CI for the HQApi project and jobs to build HQ plugins, again making it easier to distribute patch fixes in binary form between releases.\n\nHudson I’ve very impressed! I’m glad the fact that Java won’t run on some of the platforms you want to support hasn’t stopped you from testing anyways. Clearly you folks have written some addition tools behind the scenes, mind discussing them a bit?\n\nDoug Other than some Hudson plugin tweaks and additions, the Perl script I mentioned earlier was converted to generate the majority of our Hudson jobs and includes a simple templating system.  The same script generates jobs to build collectd and a few other projects.  We’ve outgrown this flavor of the script and have started working on integrating Opscode Chef to automate our Hudson configration along with the systems we build and test on. And of course, we’re using Hyperic HQ to monitor our Hudson server instances, agent and node machines.\n\nHudson But of course, I’d say dog-fooding is an important part of any continuous testing set up. It appears that SpringSource has bought in pretty deeply to a Hudson-oriented workflow, given the amount of time and resources you all have invested in getting the massive farm set up that you have. That said, on a scale from 1-10, how important would you rate Hudson to your day-to-day workflow?\n\nDoug I’d say at least an 8, although my daily workflow doesn’t always directly involve Hudson.  Most of those points go to Hudson for automating what otherwise would be interrupting my workflow on a daily basis.\n\nI'd like to thank Doug again for giving us a peek behind the curtains at SpringSource and how they're using Hudson. If you would like to discuss your organization or company's use of Hudson for Continuous Blog, you can contact me at `tyler` at `linux.com`\n\nEditor’s note: Doug was the primary author of mod_perl for many years until he was tricked into \"helping out\" with a new project.  This project turned into Hyperic HQ which shifted his focus to systems and application management for the past ~7 years and counting.  He occasionally rambles on Twitter as @dougmaceachern.","title":"Spotlight on: SpringSource","tags":["general","feedback","interview"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

About 10 months ago Kohsuke announced the Hudson EC2 plugin which has seen slow, but steady development since then, including support for the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud which was added to the plugin in a release last Monday.\n\nAs The Build Doctor and his readers point out, continuous integration is a difficult task to offload into the cloud because of the immense hardware demands constant building and testing presents. That said, Hudson does very effectively manage spinning agents up and down on demand if you’ve configured it as such. Implication being: running Hudson in the cloud may be more efficient to meet peak demands without needing to run a large farm of machines.\n\nIf you’re interested in trying out the EC2 plugin, check out Sonatype’s post on Nexus Open Source and Hudson on EC2 might be a good start.\n\nWould you run Hudson in the cloud?","title":"Would you run Hudson in the cloud?","tags":["jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

There were however some notable commits in this release cycle that didn’t make the changelog just yet, for example https://twitter.com/ godin [godin] committed an ebuild which will allow for a native package of Hudson for Gentoo Linux, joining the ranks of the existing packages for Debian/Ubuntu, FreeBSD, OpenSolaris, openSUSE and RedHat/Fedora Linux. The bundled Subversion plugin was updated and thanks to sogabe and wyukawa the Japanese translations for Hudson got some updates as well.\n\nFor Hudson developers, both plugin and core, this release contains some notable changes from mindless (a.k.a Alan Harder), a number of calls which have been deprecated for over two years have finally been pruned from the code base:\n\nHudson.addListener(JobListener), Hudson.removeListener(JobListener)\n\nEntire listeners.JobListener class (replaced by ItemListener)\n\nOne form of DirectoryBrowser constructor\n\nOne form of Descriptor.configure() (with HttpServletRequest param)\n\nDescriptor.convert(Map) and 4 implementations of this method, and code calling it in Descriptor.readResolve() (this code called save() whenever updating data, so there should be no remaining cases out there)\n\nAlan’s quest for removing deprecated code will likely continue for a while, but this is a good step in the right direction, keeping Hudson’s internals in good working order. Worth mentioning, the influx of plugin releases in the This Week in Plugins from a couple weeks ago, was driven largely by Alan, rummaging through the code of older plugins, updating plugins left and right.\nNow the breakdown for this release:\n\nBugs fixed\n\nFix javascript problem showing test failure detail for test name with a quote character. ( issue 1544)\n\nHudson can incorrectly configure labels for the controller when bleeding edge EC2 plugin is used.\n\nFixed the regression wrt the whitespace trimming caused by 1.346. ( issue 5633)\n\nUnder some circumstances, Hudson can incorrectly delete the temporary directory itself. ( issue 5642)\n\nNewlines in MAVEN_OPTS environment variable can cause problems in other contexts. ( issue 5651)\n\nEnhancements\n\nImproved the form validation mechanism to support multiple controls. ( issue 5610)\n\nAdded message to agent log when it has successfully come online.
