This is based on the current LTS (and will be kept up to date with the LTS) - but does not include the weekly releases (yet). Having a jenkins image that is fairly basic (it includes enough to run some basic builds, as well as jenkins itself) built on the LTS, on the latest LTS of Ubuntu seemed quite convenient - and easy to maintain using the official Ubuntu/Debian packaging of Jenkins.\n\n+\n\n+\nDocker is a great way to try and use server based systems - it brings all the dependencies needed and the images actually are portable (ie anywhere docker runs you can run docker images). There are official images for many popular server platforms (redis, mysql, all the linux distros and so on) so it seemed crazy to not include Jenkins along with this list. +\n\"docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins\" is all you need to get going with LTS Jenkins now. +\nYou can also use \"docker run jenkins:1.554\" to get the latest of that lineage of LTS releases, or pick a specific one: \"docker run jenkins:1.554.3\" if you like. Leaving off a version assumes the latest. Check the https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/tags/manage/[tags] page to see what is available. +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nYou can read more and see how you https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/[can use it here.] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThere has been some questions and discussions on how to make use of Jenkins with the docker hub for creating new and interesting docker image based workflows for deployment. +\nIn fact, Jenkins featured in one of the first slides of the first keynote of docker con: +\n +\nimage:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qAC-f6ceVho/U5rfqpzj3VI/AAAAAAAAC8w/Ta4pzEhm-8A/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-06-13+at+8.34.10+pm.png[image] +\n +\nTo make this dream a reality some additional https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/DockerHub+Plugin[plugins] had to be created - but this leaves the possibility of working with the docker hub (builds, stores images) and Jenkins (workflow, testing, deployment) to build out some kind of a continuous pipeline for handling docker based apps. I attempted to describe this more https://developer-blog.cloudbees.com/2014/07/announcing-dockerhub-jenkins-plugin.html[here]. +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThis image is maintained in this github https://github.com/cloudbees/jenkins-ci.org-docker[repo] and the official images are build by the https://github.com/docker/stackbrew[\"stackbrew\" system].

I comissioned https://www.fast-d.com/search/engineers/2798[akiki], a 3D model designer, to turn our beloved butler into a fully-digital color-printable figure.

While the timing of the event turned out to be less than ideal for reasons beyond our control, that didn't stop 400 Jenkins users from showing up at the \"explosive\" event at a seaside hotel near Tel Aviv. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://twitter.com/shlomibenhaim[Shlomi Ben-Haim] kicked off the conference by reporting that JUC Israel just keeps getting bigger, and that we sold out 2 weeks earlier and the team had to turn down people who really wanted to come in. The degree of adoption of Jenkins is amazing in this part of the world, and we might have to find a bigger venue next year to accomodate everyone who wants to come. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/12508267@N00/14497395798[image:https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5562/14497395798_52a7c92866_n.jpg[IMG_9716,width=320,height=213]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIt turns out most of the talks were in Hebrew, so it was difficult for me to really understand what's going on, but the talks ranged from highly technical ones like how to provision Jenkins from configuration management (the server as welll as jobs), all the way to more culture focused one like how to deploy CD practice in an organization. Companies large and small were well represented, and I met with a number of folks who actively contribute to the community. +\n +\n\n+\nThere were a lot of hall way conversations, and those of us at the booth had busy time. +\n +\n\n+\nThanks everyone who came, thanks JFrog for being on the ground for the event (and congratulations for the new round of funding) and CloudBees for hosting the event.
