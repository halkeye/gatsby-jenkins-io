One script is one job, and as you repeatedly execute jobs, it creates builds as records. As the use case of Jenkins gets more sophisticated, people started combining jobs to orchestrate ever more complex activities.\n\nA number of plugins have been developed to enable all sorts of different ways to compose jobs, and many are used quite successfully in production. But this resulted in a certain degree of complexity for users to figure out how to assemble these plugins.\n\nSo we felt the need to develop a single unified solution that subsumes all these different ways to orchestrate activities that may span across multiple build agents, code repositories, etc. Various inputs from users as well as other plugin developers played a key role.\n\nThe result of this is the workflow plugin, which is what a number of us, including Jesse Glick an myself, are focused on in the past few months.\n\nThe plugin approaches the problem by defining a DSL for you to describe an execution of a job. Various convenient primitives are available, such as executing shell scripts, checking out the source code, obtaining an executor or a build workspace, etc. All sorts of classic existing plugins contribute their functionalities into this DSL, such as recording test results, fingerprints, or calling into other existing jobs. This allows you to leverage higher-level functionalities and report comprehension capability into a workflow. Similarly, you can leverage the ability of Groovy, the host language of workflow DSL, to define control flows, abstractions, and reuse.\n\nA key feature of a workflow execution is that it’s suspendable. That is, while the workflow is running your script, you can shut down Jenkins or lose a connectivity to a agent. When it comes back, Jenkins will still remember what it was doing, and your workflow script resumes execution as if it was never interrupted. A technique known as the \" continuation-passing style\" execution plays a key role in achieving this.\n\nI’m very happy to report that the workflow plugin is finally 1.0. This version runs on the latest 1.580-based LTS. and we created a docker image for you to play with too. There’s also a JUC presentation that explains this. We are working toward 1.0 release within this year, and in the meantime, the syntax is stable enough to allow you to start designing workflows today.\n\nWe’ve been hearing a lot of good feedbacks and enthusiasm for this new effort. Please let us know what you think.","title":"Workflow plugin is 1.0","tags":["development","plugins","pipeline","workflow"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"94f28977-b270-5a37-b70b-89623666a600","slug":"/blog/2014/10/20/freebsd-project-use-of-jenkins-for-os-testing/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Craig Rodrigues\n\nThe FreeBSD project produces a modern operating system derived from BSD Unix.\n\nIn the past 6 months, we have set up Jenkins at https://jenkins.freebsd.org/, to continuously build FreeBSD as developers add new code to the project.

Last week a new version of the Gradle JPI plugin has been released to iron out some issues.\n\nThe Gradle JPI plugin enables a 100% groovy plugin development environment with Groovy as primary programming language, Spock for writing tests and Gradle as build system. Have a look at the Job DSL plugin for an example.\n\nAn existing Maven build can be converted to Gradle by using the build.gradle template from the Gradle JPI plugin’s README. For instance, the POM from the Gradle plugin translates to this build.gradle file:\n\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        mavenCentral()\n        maven {\n            url 'https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/'\n        }\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath 'org.jenkins-ci.tools:gradle-jpi-plugin:0.6.0'\n    }\n}\n\napply plugin: 'jpi'\n\ngroup = 'org.jenkins-ci.plugins'\nversion = '1.25-SNAPSHOT'\n\njenkinsPlugin {\n    coreVersion = '1.480'\n    displayName = 'Jenkins Gradle plugin'\n    url = 'https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gradle+Plugin'\n    gitHubUrl = 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin'\n\n    developers {\n        developer {\n            id 'gbois'\n            name 'Gregory Boissinot'\n            timezone '+1'\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    compile 'org.jenkins-ci.lib:dry-run-lib:0.1'\n}\n\nUsage of the Gradle JPI plugin is similar to working with the Maven HPI plugin. Use gradle jpi to build the plugin file. gradle check runs the tests, gradle install copies the plugin into the local Maven repository, gradle uploadArchives deploys the plugin to the Jenkins Maven repository and gradle server starts a Jenkins development server with the plugin installed.\n\nIt is recommended to use Gradle 1.8 because that is the version used to build and test the Gradle JPI plugin.\n\nFor the next release it is planned to do some maintenance like fixing code style issues and adding tests. After that more issues need to be addressed to bring the plugin on par with the Maven HPI plugin, most notably fixing the test dependencies ( JENKINS-17129) and publishing the plugin’s JAR ( JENKINS-25007). Updating Gradle to 2.x and getting the plugin on the Gradle plugin portal is also on the wishlist.","title":"Gradle-fy your Jenkins Plugin Project","tags":["general","guest post","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"76ef49f5-8629-511f-841c-e0ac514f6300","slug":"/blog/2014/09/25/cve-2014-6271-impact-on-jenkins/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Singapore[ +\nimage:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Singapore_Road_Signs_-_Restrictive_Sign_-_Stop_-_Security_Check.svg/240px-Singapore_Road_Signs_-_Restrictive_Sign_-_Stop_-_Security_Check.svg.png[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI suspect many of you have been impacted by https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271[CVE-2014-6271] (aka \"shellshock\" bash vulnerability.) We had our share of updates to do for various *.jenkins-ci.org servers. +\n +\n\n+\nJava application servers in general (including one that ships in Jenkins) do not fork off processes like Apache does to serve requests, so the kind of CGI attacks you see on Apache does not apply.
