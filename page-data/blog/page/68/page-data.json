This is based on the current LTS (and will be kept up to date with the LTS) - but does not include the weekly releases (yet). Having a jenkins image that is fairly basic (it includes enough to run some basic builds, as well as jenkins itself) built on the LTS, on the latest LTS of Ubuntu seemed quite convenient - and easy to maintain using the official Ubuntu/Debian packaging of Jenkins.\n\n+\n\n+\nDocker is a great way to try and use server based systems - it brings all the dependencies needed and the images actually are portable (ie anywhere docker runs you can run docker images). There are official images for many popular server platforms (redis, mysql, all the linux distros and so on) so it seemed crazy to not include Jenkins along with this list. +\n\"docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins\" is all you need to get going with LTS Jenkins now. +\nYou can also use \"docker run jenkins:1.554\" to get the latest of that lineage of LTS releases, or pick a specific one: \"docker run jenkins:1.554.3\" if you like. Leaving off a version assumes the latest. Check the https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/tags/manage/[tags] page to see what is available. +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nYou can read more and see how you https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/[can use it here.] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThere has been some questions and discussions on how to make use of Jenkins with the docker hub for creating new and interesting docker image based workflows for deployment. +\nIn fact, Jenkins featured in one of the first slides of the first keynote of docker con: +\n +\nimage:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qAC-f6ceVho/U5rfqpzj3VI/AAAAAAAAC8w/Ta4pzEhm-8A/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-06-13+at+8.34.10+pm.png[image] +\n +\nTo make this dream a reality some additional https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/DockerHub+Plugin[plugins] had to be created - but this leaves the possibility of working with the docker hub (builds, stores images) and Jenkins (workflow, testing, deployment) to build out some kind of a continuous pipeline for handling docker based apps. I attempted to describe this more https://developer-blog.cloudbees.com/2014/07/announcing-dockerhub-jenkins-plugin.html[here]. +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThis image is maintained in this github https://github.com/cloudbees/jenkins-ci.org-docker[repo] and the official images are build by the https://github.com/docker/stackbrew[\"stackbrew\" system].

This has been a real community effort, with collaboration from lots of people, both in terms of implementation and in terms of providing honest/critical feedback. Lots of people deserve credit but, in particular, a big thanks to https://github.com/kevinburke[Kevin Burke] and https://github.com/daniel-beck[Daniel Beck]. +\n +\n\n+\nYou're probably familiar with how the Jenkins UI currently looks, but for the sake of comparison I think it's worth showing a screenshot of the current/old UI alongside a screnshot of the new UI. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/current.png[ +\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/current.preview.png[image,width=500] +\n] +\n\n+\n*_Current / Old Look & Feel_* +\n\n+\nhttps://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/new.png[ +\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/new.preview.png[image,width=500] +\n] +\n\n+\n*_New Look & Feel_* +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nAmong other things, you'll see: +\n\nA new responsive layout based on elements (as opposed to elements). Try resizing the screen or viewing on a smaller device. More to come on this though, we hope.\n\nUpdated default font from Verdana to Helvetica.\n\nNicer form elements and nicer buttons.\n\nSmoother side panels e.g. Build Executors, Build Queues and Build History panes.\n\nSmoother project views with more modern tabs.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nYou might already be seeing these changes if you're using the latest and greatest code from Jenkins. If not, you should see them in the next LTS release. +\n +\n\n+\nWe've been trying to make these changes without breaking existing features and plugins and, so far, we think we've been successful but if you spot anything you think we might have had a negative effect on, then https://issues.jenkins.io[please log a JIRA] and we'll try to address it. +\n +\n\n+\nOne thing we've \"sort of\" played with too is cleaning up of the Job Config page - breaking into sections and making it easier to navigate etc. This is a big change and something we've been shying away from because of the effect it will have on plugins and form submission. That said, I think we'll need to bite the bullet and tackle this sooner or later because it's a big usability issue. +","title":"User Interface Refresh","tags":["development","core","guest post","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":536,"numPages":100,"currentPage":68}},
