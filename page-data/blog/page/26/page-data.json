Tyler Croy,\nand it largely follows the successful\nKubernetes SIG model.\nThe objective of these SIGs is to make the community more transparent to contributors\nand to offer venues for specific discussions.\nThe idea of SIGs and how to create them is documented in\nJEP-4.\nJEP-4 is still in Draft state, but a few SIGs have been already created using that process:\nPlatform SIG, GSoC SIG and, finally,\nCloud Native SIG.\n\nSIGs are a big opportunity to the Jenkins project,\noffering a new way to onboard contributors who are interested only in particular aspects of Jenkins.\nWith SIGs they can subscribe to particular topics without\nfollowing the entire Developer mailing list which can become pretty buzzy nowadays.\nIt also offers company contributors a clear way how to join community and participate in specific areas.\nThis is great for larger projects which cannot be done by a single contributor.\nLike JEPs, SIGs help focus and coordinate efforts.\n\nAnd, back to major efforts…​\nLack of resources among core contributors was one of the reasons\nwhy we did not deliver on Pluggable Storage stories back in 2016.\nI believe that SIGs can help fix that in Jenkins,\nmaking it easier to find groups with the same interests and\nreach out to them in order to organize activity.\nRegular meetings are also helpful to get such efforts moving.\n\nPoints above are the main reasons why I joined the Cloud Native SIG.\nSimilarly, that’s why I decided to create a Platform SIG\nto deliver on major efforts like Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nI hope that more SIGs get created soon so that contributors could focus on areas of their interest.\n\nCloud Native SIG\n\nIn the original proposal Carlos Sanchez,\nthe Cloud Native SIG chair, has described the purpose of the SIG well.\nThere has been great progress this year in cloud-native-minded projects like Jenkins X and Jenkins Evergreen,\nbut the current Jenkins architecture does not offer particular\nfeatures which could be utilized there:\nPluggable Storage, High Availability, etc.\nThere are ways to achieve it using Jenkins plugins and some infrastructure tweaks,\nbut it is far from the out-of-the-box experience.\nIt complicates Jenkins management and slows down development of new cloud-native solutions for Jenkins.\n\nSo, what do I expect from the SIG?\n\nDefine roadmap towards Cloud-Native Jenkins architecture\nwhich will help the project to stay relevant for Cloud Native installations\n\nProvide a venue for discussion of critical Jenkins architecture changes\n\nAct as a steering committee for Jenkins Enhancement Proposals in the area of\nCloud-Native solutions\n\nFinally, coordinate efforts between contributors and get new\ncontributors onboard\n\nWhat’s next in the SIG?\n\nThe SIG agenda is largely defined by the SIG participants.\nIf you are interested to discuss particular topics,\njust propose them in the SIG mailing list.\nAs the current SIG page describes,\nthere are several areas defined as initial topics:\nArtifact Storage,\nLog Storage,\nConfiguration Storage\n\nAll these topics are related to the Pluggable Storage Area,\nand the end goal for them is to ensure that all data is externalized\nso that replication becomes possible.\nIn addition to the mentioned data types,\ndiscussed at the Jenkins World 2016 summit,\nwe will need to externalize other data types:\nItem and Run storage,\nFingerprints,\nTest and coverage results,\netc.\nThere is some foundation work being done for that.\nFor example, Shenyu Zheng is working on a\nCode Coverage API plugin\nwhich would allow to unify the code coverage storage formats in Jenkins.\n\nOnce the Pluggable Storage stories are done the next steps are true High Availability, rolling or canary upgrades and zero downtime.\nAt that point other foundation stories like Remoting over Kafka\nby Pham Vu Tuan\nmight be integrated into the Cloud Native architecture to make Jenkins more robust against outages within the cluster.\nIt will take some time to get to this state, but it can be done incrementally.\n\nLet me briefly summarize current state of the 3 focuses listed in the Cloud Native SIG.\n\nArtifact Storage\n\nThere are many existing plugins allowing to upload and download artifacts from external storage\n(e.g. S3, Artifactory, Publish over SFTP, etc., etc.),\nbut there are no plugins which can do it transparently without using\nnew steps.\nIn many cases the artifacts also get uploaded through the controller,\nand it increases load on the system.\nIt would be great if there was a layer which would allow storing artifacts externally\nwhen using common steps like Archive Artifacts.\n\nArtifact storage work was started this spring by Jesse Glick, Carlos Sanchez and\nIvan Fernandez Calvo\nbefore the Cloud Native SIG was actually founded.\nCurrent state:\n\nJEP-202 \"External Artifact Storage\"\nhas been proposed in the Jenkins community.\nThis JEP defines API changes in the Jenkins core which are needed to\nsupport External artifact managers\n\nJenkins Pipeline has been updated to support external artifact storages\nfor archive / unarchive and stash / unstash\n\nNew Artifact Manager for S3 plugin\nreference implementation of the new API.\nThe plugin is available in main Jenkins update centers\n\nA number of plugins has been updated in order to support\nexternal artifact storage\n\nThe Artifact Manager API is available in Jenkins LTS starting from 2.121.1,\nso it is possible to create new implementations using the provided API and\nexisting implementations.\nThis new feature is fully backward compatible with the default Filesystem-based storage,\nbut there are known issues for plugins explicitly relying on artifact locations in JENKINS_HOME\n(you can find a list of such plugins\nhere).\nIt will take a while to get all plugins supported,\nbut the new API in the core should allow migrating plugins.\n\nI hope we will revisit the External Artifact Storage at the SIG meetings at some point.\nIt would be a good opportunity to do a retrospective and to understand how to improve the process\nin SIG.\n\nLog storage\n\nLog storage is a separate big story.\nBack in 2016 External logging was one of the key Pluggable Storage stories we defined at the contributor summit.\nWe created an EPIC for the story ( JENKINS-38313)\nand after that created a number of prototypes together with\nXing Yan and Jesse Glick.\nOne of these prototypes for Pipeline has recently been updated and published\nhere.\n\nJesse Glick and Carlos Sanchez\nare returning to this story and plan to discuss it within the Cloud Native SIG.\nThere are a number of Jenkins Enhancement proposals which have been submitted recently:\n\njep:207[] -\nExternal Build Logging support in the Jenkins Core\n\njep:210[] -\nExternal log storage for Pipeline\n\njep:212[] -\nExternal Logging API Plugin\n\njep:206[] -\nUse UTF-8 for Pipeline build logs\n\nIn the linked documents you can find references to current reference implementations.\nSo far we have a working prototype for the new design.\nThere are still many bits to fix before the final release,\nbut the designs are ready for review and feedback.\n\nThis Tuesday (Jul 31) we are going to have a SIG meeting in order to present the current state and to discuss the proposed designs and JEPs.\nThe meeting will happen at 3PM UTC.\nYou can watch the broadcast using this link.\nParticipant link will be posted in the SIGs Gitter channel 10 minutes before the meeting.\n\nConfiguration storage\n\nThis is one of the future stories we would like to consider.\nAlthough configurations are not big, externalizing them is a critical task\nfor getting highly-available or disposable Jenkins controllers.\nThere are many ways to store configurations in Jenkins,\nbut 95% of cases are covered by the XmlFile layer which\nserializes objects to disk and reads them using the XStream library.\nExternalizing these XmlFile s would be a great step forward.\n\nThere are several prototypes for externalizing configurations,\ne.g. in DotCI.\nThere are also other implementations which could be upstreamed to the Jenkins core:\n\nAlex Nordlund has recently proposed a\npull request\nto Jenkins Core, which should make the XML Storage pluggable\n\nJames Strachan has implemented similar engine\nfor Kubernetes in the kubeify prototype\n\nI also did some experiments with externalizing XML Storages back in 2016\n\nThe next steps for this story would be to aggregate implementations into a single JEP.\nI have it in my queue, and I hope to write up a design once we get more clarity on the External logging stories.\n\nConclusions\n\nSpecial Interest Groups are a new format for collaboration and disucssion in the Jenkins community.\nAlthough we have had some work groups before (Infrastructure, Configuration-as-Code, etc.),\nintroduction of SIGs sets a new bar in terms of the project transparency and consistency.\nMajor architecture changes in Jenkins are needed to ensure its future in the new environments,\nand SIGs will help to boost visibility and participation around these changes.\n\nIf you want to know more about the Cloud Native SIG,\nall resources are listed on the SIG’s page on jenkins.io.\nIf you want to participate in the SIG’s activities, just do the following:\n\nSubscribe to the mailing list\n\nJoin our Gitter channel\n\nJoin our public meetings\n\nI am also working on organizing a face-to-face Cloud Native SIG meeting at the\nJenkins Contributor Summit,\nwhich will happen on September 17 during\nDevOps World | Jenkins World in San Francisco.\nIf you come to DevOps World | Jenkins World,\nplease feel free to join us at the contributor summit or to meet us at the community booth.\nTogether with Jesse and Carlos we are also going to present some bits of our work at the\nA Cloud Native Jenkins talk.\n\nStay tuned for more updates and demos on the Cloud-Native Jenkins fronts!","title":"Introducing Jenkins Cloud Native

infrastructure is continuously improving.\nThe latest service to get some attention and major improvement is the Jenkins javadoc.\n\nThere were a number of issues affecting that service:\n\nIrregular updates -\nDevelopers wouldn’t find the latest java documentation because of inadequate update frequence.\n\nBroken HTTPS support -\nwhen users would go to the Javadoc site they would get an unsafe site warning and then an incorrect redirection.\n\nObsolete content - Javadoc was not cleaned up correctly and plenty of obsolete pages remained which confused end users.\n\nAs Jenkins services\nmigrate to Azure infrastructure,\nsomething that needed to be done was to move the javadoc service there as a standalone service.\nI took the same approach as jenkins.io, putting data on an azure file storage, using a nginx proxy in front of it and running on kubernetes.\nThis approach brings multiple benefits:\n\nWe store static files on an azure file storage which brings data reliability, redundancy, etc.\n\nWe use Kubernetes Ingress to configure HTTP/HTTPS endpoint\n\nWe use Kubernetes Service to provide load balancing\n\nWe use Kubernetes deployment to deploy default

There are also issues with traffic prioritization and multi-agent communications, which impact Jenkins stability and scalability.\n\nThis project aims to develop a plugin in order to add support of a popular message queue/bus technology (Kafka) as a fault-tolerant communication layer in Jenkins.\n\nBenefits to the community\n\nProvide a new method to connect agent to controller using Kafka besides existing methods such as JNLP or SSH Build Agents plugin.\n\nHelp to resolve the existing issues with the TCP protocol between controller and agent communication in Jenkins.\n\nHelp to resolve traffic prioritization and multi-agent communications issue in Jenkins.\n\nWhy Kafka?\n\nWhen planning for this project, we want to use traditional message queue system such as ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ. However, after some discussion, we decided to have a try with Kafka with more suitable features with this project:\n\nKafka itself is not a queue like ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ, it is a distributed, replicated commit log. This helps to remove message delivery complexity we have in traditional queue system.\n\nWe need to support data streaming as a requirement, and Kafka is good at this aspect, which RabbitMQ is lack of.\n\nKafka is said to have a better scalability and good support from the development community.\n\nArchitecture Overview\n\nThe project consists of multiple components:\n\nKafka Client Library - new command transport implementation, producer and consumer client logic.\n\nRemoting Kafka Plugin - plugin implementation with KafkaGlobalConfiguration, KafkaComputerLauncher and KafkaSecretManager.\n\nRemoting Kafka Agent - A custom JAR agent with remoting JAR packaged together with a custom Engine implementation to setup a communication channel with Kafka. The agent is also packaged as a Docker image in DockerHub.\n\nAll the components are packaged together with Docker Compose.\n\nThe below diagram is the overview of the current architecture:\n\nWith this design, controller is not communicating with agent using direct TCP communication anymore, all the communication commands are transfered with Kafka.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe project is now under the third coding phase and we have some features available in 1.0 release.\n\n1. Kafka Global Configuration with support of credentials plugin to store secrets.\n\n2. Launch agent with Kafka Launcher.\n\n3. Launch agent from CLI using agent JAR with secret provided to ensure security.\n\n4. Run jobs, pipeline using Kafka agent.\n\n5. Kafka communication between controller and agent.\n\nRemoting operations are being executed over Kafka. In the log you may see:\n\nCommand execution (SlaveInstallerFactoryImpl.isWindows())\n\nClassloading (Classloader.fetch())\n\nLog streaming (Pipe.chunk())\n\nHow to run demo\n\nWe have setup a ready-to-fly demo for this plugin. You can try to run a demo of the plugin by following this instruction.\nFeatures in the demo:\n\nDocker Compose starts preconfigured controller and agent instance, they connect automatically using Kafka launcher.\n\nKafka is secured and encrypted with SSL.\n\nThere few demo jobs in the instance so that a user can launch a job on the agent.\n\nKakfa Manager supported in localhost:9000 to support monitoring of Kafka cluster.\n\nPhase 2 Presentation Slides\n\nPhase 2 Presentation Video\n\nLinks\n\nGitHub Repository\n\nWiki\n\nPlugin Site\n\nProject Info\n\nIntroduction Blogpost\n\nPhase 1 Evaluation Slides\n\nPhase 2 Evaluation Slides\n\nPhase 1 Evaluation Video\n\nPhase 2 Evaluation Video","title":"Remoting Kafka Plugin 1.0: A new method to connect agents","tags":["plugins","gsoc","gsoc2018","remoting","kafka"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/19e71/pvtuan10.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/77b35/pvtuan10.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/d4a57/pvtuan10.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/19e71/pvtuan10.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/ef6ff/pvtuan10.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/8257c/pvtuan10.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/6766a/pvtuan10.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/pvtuan10.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"pvtuan10","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Pham Vu Tuan is a developer from Singapore.\nHe starts contributing to Jenkins from Google Summer of Code 2018 for <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2018/remoting-over-message-bus/\">Jenkins Remoting over Message Bus/Queue</a></p>\n</div>","id":"pvtuan10","irc":"pvtuan10","linkedin":null,"name":"Pham Vu Tuan","slug":"/blog/authors/pvtuan10/","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9b44e013-999c-51f8-b612-64b922311110","slug":"/blog/2018/07/20/devops-world-jenkins-world-2018-agenda-is-live/","strippedHtml":"This year the Jenkins project introduced a few exciting efforts:\nConfiguration as Code, Jenkins X, Jenkins Evergreen, Blue Ocean and Pipeline.\nWith DevOps World-Jenkins World San Francisco and Nice only a few short months away,\nwe’ve made sure to include plenty of sessions related to these exciting efforts on the agenda.\nWith that said, the agenda for both cities is now live and will include workshops and deep dive\nsessions on these efforts and much more.\nProject contributors for these efforts will be present at both conferences as well, come say ‘hello’.\nHere’s a glimpse of what’s on the agenda:\n\nWorkshops\n\nBuilding Continuous Delivery for Microservices with Jenkins X\n\nCreating a Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins 2\n\nJenkins Administration Fundamentals\n\nJenkins Pipeline Fundamentals\n\nAnd more\n\nSessions\n\nCommon Pitfalls in Jenkins Security and How to Avoid Them –\nOleg Nenashev\n\nHabits, Tips and Tricks to Efficiently Automate Tasks with Jenkins -\nMichael Paillloncy\n\nSafely Upgrading Jenkins Everyday -

We’ve started documenting the capabilities that are available\ntoday and will continue as more become available.\n\nCredit: thanks to tracymiranda for the image\n\nUse version control for all artifacts\n\nThe Weaveworks folks coined the term GitOps which we love.  Any change to an environment, whether it be a new application,\nversion upgrade, resource limit change or simple application configuration should be raised as a Pull Request to Git, have\nchecks run against it like a form of CI for environments and approved by a team that has control over what goes into the\nrelated environment.  We can now enable governance and have full traceability for any change to an environment.\n\nRelated Accelerate capability:  Use version control for all production artifacts\n\nAutomate your deployment process\n\nEnvironments\n\nJenkins X will automatically create Git backed environments during installation and makes it easy to add new ones using\njx create environment.  Additionally when creating new applications via a quickstart ( jx create quickstart), Java based\nSpringBoot ( jx create spring) or importing existing applications ( jx import), Jenkins X will both automatically add\nCI / CD pipelines and setup the jobs, git repos and webhooks to enable an automated deployment process.\n\nOut of the box Jenkins X creates Staging and Production (this is customisable) permanent environments as well as temporary\nenvironments for preview applications from Pull Requests.\n\nPreviews Environments\n\nWe are trying to move as much testing, security, validation and experimentation for a change before it’s merged to master.\nWith the use of temporary dynamically created Preview Environments any pull request can have a preview version built and\ndeployed, including libraries that feed into a downstream deployable application.  This means we can code review, test,\ncollaborate better with all teams that are involved in agreeing that change can go live.\n\nUltimately Jenkins X wants to provide a way that developers, testers, designers and product managers can be as sure as they\ncan that when a change is merged to master it works as expected.  We want to be confident the proposed change does not\nnegatively affect any service or feature as well as deliver the value it is intended to.\n\nWhere Preview Environments get really interesting is when we are able to progress a PR through various stages of maturity and\nconfidence where we begin to direct a percentage of real production traffic like beta users to it.  We can then analyse the\nvalue of the proposed change and possible run multiple automated experiments over time using Hypothesis Driven Development.\nThis helps give us better understanding of how the change will perform when released to all users.\n\nRelated Accelerate capability: Foster and enable team experimentation\n\nUsing preview environments is a great way to introduce better test automation.  While Jenkins X enables this we don’t yet\nhave examples of automated tests being run against a preview environment.  A simple test would be to ensure the application\nstarts ok and Kubernetes liveness check pass for an amount of time. This relates to\n\nRelated Accelerate capability: Implement Test Automation\nRelated Accelerate capability: Automate your deployment process\n\nPermanent Environments\n\nIn software development we’re used to working with multiple environments in the lead up to a change being promoted to a live\nproduction environment.  Whilst this seems business as usual it can cause significant delays to other changes if for any\nreason that it is deemed not fit via some process that didn’t happen pre merge to master.  Subsequent commits then become\nblocked and can cause delay of urgent changes being promoted to production.\n\nAs above Jenkins X wants any changes and experiments to be validated before it is merged to master.  We would like changes in\na staging environment to be held there for a short amount of time before being promoted, ideally in an automated fashion.\n\nThe default Jenkins X pipelines provide deployment automation via environments.  These are customisable to suite your own\nCI / CD pipeline requirements.\n\nJenkins X recommends Staging should act as a near as possible reflection on production, ideally with real production data\nshadowed to it using a service mesh to understand the behaviour.  This also helps when developing changes in preview where we\ncan link to non production services in staging.\n\nRelated Accelerate capability: Automate your deployment process\n\nUse trunk-based development\n\nThe Accelerate book found that teams which use trunk based development with short lived branches performed better.  This has\nalways worked for the Jenkins X core team members so this was an easy capability for Jenkins X to implement when setting up\nGit repositories and CI/CD jobs.\n\nImplement Continuous Integration\n\nJenkins X sees CI as the effort of validating a proposed change via pull requests before it is merged to controller.  Jenkins X\nwill automatically configure source code repositories, Jenkins and Kubernetes to provide Continuous Integration of the box.\n\nImplement Continuous Delivery\n\nJenkins X sees CD as the effort of taking that change after it’s been merged to controller through to running in a live\nenvironment.  Jenkins X automates many parts in a release pipeline:\n\nJenkins X advocates the use of semantic versioning.  We use git tags to calculate the next release version which means we\ndon’t need to store the latest release version in the controller branch.  Where release systems do store the last or next version\nin Git repos it means CD becomes hard, as a commit in a release pipeline back to controller triggers a new release.  This results\nin a recursive release trigger.  Using a Git tag helps avoid this situation which Jenkins X completely automates.\n\nJenkins X will automatically create a released version on every merge to master which can then potentially progress\nthrough to production.\n\nUse loosely coupled architecture\n\nBy targeting Kubernetes users of Jenkins X can take advantage of many of the cloud features that help design and develop\nloosely coupled solutions.  Service discovery, fault tolerance, scalability, health checks, rolling upgrades, container\nscheduling and orchestration to name just a few examples of where Kubernetes helps.\n\nArchitect for empowered teams\n\nJenkins X aims to help polyglot application developers.  Right now Jenkins X has quickstarts and automated CI/CD setup with\nlanguage detection for Golang, Java, NodeJS, .Net, React, Angular, Rust, Swift and more to come.  What this also does is\nprovide a consistent Way of Working so developers can concentrate on developing.\n\nJenkins X also provides many addons, for example Grafana and Prometheus for automated metrics collection and visualisation.\nIn this example centralised metrics help understand how your applications behave when built and deployed on Kubernetes.\n\nDevPods are another feature which enables developers to edit source code in their\nlocal IDE, behind the scenes it is then synced to the cloud and rapidly built and redeployed.\n\nJenkins X believes providing developers automation that helps them experiment in the cloud, with different technologies and\nfeedback empowers them to make the best decisions - faster.\n\nFancy a closer look?\n\nMyself, James Strachan and\nRob Davies are going to be presenting and running workshops at\nDevOps World  | Jenkins World.  We’ll also be hanging out at the Jenkins X demo\narea so come and say hello and see what’s the latest cool and exiting things to come out of Jenkins X.  Use JWFOSS for 30%\ndiscount off registration\n\nWant to get involved?\n\nJenkins X is open source, the community mainly hangs out in the\nJenkins X Kubernetes slack channels and for tips on being more involved with Jenkins X\ntake a look at our contributing docs.  We’ve been helping lots of folks get into open source, learn\nnew technoligies and languages like golang.

Users should be able to\nconfigure job type using YAML file placed in root directory of the\nGit repository being the subject of the pull request. The plugin should interact with various\nplatforms like Bitbucket, Github, Gitlab, etc whenever a pull request is created or updated.\n\nPlugin detects the presence of certain types of reports at conventional locations,\nand publish them automatically. If the reports are not present at their respective conventional\nlocation, the location of the report can be configured in the YAML file.\n\nMy mentors are\nOleg Nenashev (Org Admin),\nMartin d’Anjou,\nKristin Whetstone,\nJeff Knurek\n\nBenefits to the community\n\nProject administrators will be able to handle pull request builds more easily.\n\nBuild specifications for pull requests can be written in a concise declarative format.\n\nBuild reports will be automatically published to Github, Bitbucket, etc.\n\nBuild status updates will be sent to git servers automatically.\n\nUsers will not have to deal with pipeline code.\n\nIf there will be no merge conflicts or build failures, the PR can be merged into target branch.\n\nPhase 1 blog post\n\nPlease see Phase 1 blog post\n\nImplementations till now\n\nAlpha version of the plugin is released. It supports all features of Multi-Branch Pipeline and offers the following features.\n\nBuild description is defined via YAML file stored within the SCM repo. This plugin\nwill depend on GitHub plugin, Bitbucket plugin, Gitlab plugin if users will be\nusing respective platforms for their repositories.\n\nConversion of YAML to Declarative Pipeline: A class YamlToPipeline\nis written which will load the \"Jenkinsfile.yaml\" and make use of PipelineSnippetGenerator class\nto generate Declarative pipeline code.\n\nReporting of results, only xml report types is supported for now.\n\nUse of Yaml file (Jenkinsfile.yaml) from target branch.\n\nGit Push step: To push the changes of pull request to the target branch. This is implemented\nusing git-plugin, PushCommand is used for this from git-plugin. credentialId,\nbranch name and repository url for interacting with Github, Bitbucket, etc\nwill be taken automatically from \"Branch-Source\" (Users have to fill this\ndetails of branch source in job configuration UI). (You can see\nHow to run the demo)\n\nStepConfigurator: To generate pipeline code for all supported steps in Jenkins. This is using\nJenkins configuration-as-code plugin (JCasC plugin) to configure a particular step object and\nthen that step object is passed to Snippetizer.object2Groovy() method to generate the script of that step.\n\nJenkinsfile.yaml example\n\nFor the phase 1 prototype demonstration, the following yaml file was used.\nNote that this format is subject to change in the next phases of the project,\nas we formalise the yaml format definition.\n\n#  Docker image agent example\nagent:\n label: my_label\n customWorkspace: path_to_workspace\n dockerImage: maven:3-alpine\n args: -v /tmp:/tmp\n\n  tools:\n    maven : maven_3.0.1\n    jdk : jdk8\n\nconfiguration:\n  # Push PR changes to the target branch if the build succeeds.\n  # default value is false\n  pushPrOnSuccess: false\n\n  # Trusted user to approve pull requests\n  prApprovers:\n    - username1\n    - username2\n    - username3\n\nenvironment:\n  variables:\n    variable_1: value_1\n    variable_2: value_2\n\n  # Credentials contains only two fields. credentialId must be present in the Jenkins Credentials\n  credentials:\n    - credentialId : fileCredentialId\n      variable : FILE\n\n      # In user scripts Username and Password can be accessed by LOGIN_USR and LOGIN_PSW\n      # respectively as environment variales\n    - credentialId : dummyGitRepo\n      variable : LOGIN\n\nstages:\n  - name: stage1\n    agent: any\n    steps:\n      - sh: \"scripts/hello\"\n      - sleep:\n          time: 2\n          unit: SECONDS\n      - sleep: 2\n      - junit:\n          testResults: \"target/**.xml\"\n          allowEmptyResults: true\n          testDataPublishers:\n            - AutomateTestDataPublisher\n            - JunitResultPublisher:\n                urlOverride: \"urlOverride\"\n    # Post section for \"stage1\".
