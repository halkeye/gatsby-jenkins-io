Besides snapping the photo below, I also managed to get yelled out by an old woman wearing a red \"security\" jacket; suffice to say my JavaOne experience is already everything I expected! image:https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/4997929716_1675745efe.jpg\n\nUnlike last year’s Oracle OpenWorld, which also shut down this segment of Howard St in San Francisco and took over the adjacent Yerba Buena Gardens, this event will be crammed together with JavaOne.\n\nAt this point I’m not sure what I can expect as far as the JavaOne portion of the event goes, we do have two Hudson related events scheduled:\n\nGetting More Out of Your Hudson - Monday at 10:00 a.m. - Hosted by our very own Kohsuke Kawaguchi, the session will be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Embarcadero.\n\nGetting More from Your CI Server: Taking Hudson to the Next Level - Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. - Hosted by the (in)famous John Smart the session will also be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Cyril Magnin 1.\n\nUnfortunately those were the only specifically-Hudson related tracks I could find, as Andrew Bayer has mentioned before, finding a proper schedule is near impossible. While at JavaOne, I intend on posting updates, pictures and maybe a little scathing commentary (they did give me a blogger pass for some silly reason).\n\nIf you’re going to be at JavaOne, think about coming and talking to me about how you/your company uses Hudson. I might just have stickers!","title":"JavaOne taking shape","tags":["general","javaone"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"6e79bb60-9024-5d9b-bf6a-18bea1a6bd36","slug":"/blog/2010/09/09/lets-talk-about-hudson-at-javaone/","strippedHtml":"A few months ago I enjoyed running a couple interviews with folks who were using Hudson but lately I’ve lacked the time and coffee to get more interviews done.\n\nI am planning on making up for it by bringing my fancy smancy tape recorder (i.e. a smartphone) and a few notepads to the upcoming JavaOne conference here in San Francisco.\n\nIf you’re interested in talking to me about how you or your company uses Hudson in your quest for world domination, you will be able to find me at the Hudson hackathon on Sunday the 19th, or at JavaOne on Monday, Tuesday and maybe Wednesday.\n\nFeel free to drop me a line at tyler[at]linux.com and we’ll set something up!","title":"Let's talk about Hudson at JavaOne","tags":["general","interview"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a88c7ef1-9616-56e2-af1b-362d3846cc0e","slug":"/blog/2010/09/05/hudsonmobi-dons-a-black-turtleneck-and-jumps-to-ios4/","strippedHtml":"Last time I talked about HudsonMobi 2.0 there were some hiccups with the QR code which made me pretty irritated. Now the leading mobile app for Hudson users has regained my trust with their lastest release for iOS 4, the latest incarnation of Apple’s mobile operating systems for iPhones and iPod Touches.\n\nSince I fall into the category of subhumans who for one reason or another choose not to own an iPhone, I can’t verify the awesomeness of this new HudsonMobi release. If it is anything like the 2.0 release for Android you can expect enhancements such as:\n\nTighter integration with iOS 4\n\nEmbedded artifact viewer! For archived build artifacts that are text-based, you can view them directly on your handset.\n\nAccess to the build history and changes for a job.\n\nQuick and easy access to a job’s last build\n\nIf you own a device with iOS 3.0 or higher you should be able to download HudsonMobi 2.0 from the appstore, if you give it a whirl, please leave a comment to let me know how awesome it is :)\n\n---","title":"HudsonMobi dons a black turtleneck and jumps to iOS4","tags":["general","news"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","id":"db2d22a5-3d44-5396-a2f6-4cfdbed3cd6b","slug":"/blog/2010/09/04/hudson-events-calendar/","strippedHtml":"Just wanted to let everybody know that I’ve gone ahead and added a Calendar for all the upcoming Hudson-related events.\n\nHopefully we’ll be able to add more and more events for the rest of the year including seminars, more meetups and potentially a few drink-ups!\n\nWorth mentioning that I’ve not yet tested the iCal feed so if you have troubles with it, let me know (via the comments).","title":"Hudson Events Calendar","tags":["general","meta"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9cbddb28-b3f3-50db-851e-8dc3b544dec7","slug":"/blog/2010/09/02/recent-label-and-matrix-project-improvement/","strippedHtml":"Today, I’d highlight two recent improvements to the label and matrix projects.\n\nWhen you have multiple agents in your Hudson build farm, you can use labels to classify agents by their capability/environment/architecture/etc. For example, your one agent might have “32bit” and “windows” label, while another one might have “linux”, “ubuntu”, and “64bit.” (with plugins like platform-labeler plugin, you can attach labels automatically, too.) Or if you do Selenium testing, you might add browser names as labels to indicate which agent has which browser available.\n\nWith such set up, you then specify that such and such jobs can be only run on such and such labels. For example, you might say your “test-foo” job requires the “windows” label, while your “compile-bar” job might require the “macos” label.\nStarting 1.372, Hudson now lets you use boolean expressions here, instead of just specifying one label as the requirement. For example, your “seleniumTest-zot” job can now say it requires “windows&&firefox” since it’s meant to run on Windows with Firefox. Or if your job requires a shell script, you might say “!windows” to indicate that it has to be run somewhere that’s not Windows.\n\nLabels are also often used in the context of the multi-configuration project (a.k.a. matrix project.) In a multi-configuration project, you specify what to execute to build your project, then specify a number of “axes” that represents the variable and their possible values to execute a build. There are several different kinds of axes (and this is of course extensible), and one of them is the label axis.\n\nFor example, say you have a test suite that you want to run on Windows, Linux, and Solaris, to make sure it works correctly under all these environments. In such a case, you define one label axis, and tell Hudson that you have three possible values “windows”, “linux”, and “solaris.” When you build this project, Hudson will run your build three times by finding appropriate agent that carries the specified label.\n\nIn 1.373, you can now specify multiple label axes. For example, you might have a C++ project that needs to be compiled on various platforms. In such a case, you can define one label axis to be “windows”, “linux”, “solaris”, and you can define another label axis to be “32bit” and “64bit”. This will generate 3x2=6 combinations to be executed.\n\nSometimes the exhaustive combinations do not make sense. In such a case, you can use a filter boolean expression to eliminate some values. You can also use the same mechanism to create a sparse matrix — that is, you tell Hudson to reduce the coverage to 33%, and Hudson will eliminate every 2 out of 3 combinations.\n\nFinally, I’d like to thank Sandia National Laboratories for sponsoring this work, which made it possible for InfraDNA to provide this feature to the community. People often think that contributing code is the only way to give back to the project, but sponsoring features like this is another great way to do it.","title":"Recent label and matrix project improvement","tags":["development","core","tutorial"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"5b8f7dab-40ba-5e57-9d6a-7185e39ffb1a","slug":"/blog/2010/09/01/copenhagen-hudson-user-meetup/","strippedHtml":"September is turning into a meetup month for the Hudson community.

Read on for the details.\n\nThe current tentative plan is to do a short \"state of the union / what’s new\" kind of presentation, then use the rest of the time for open mic Q&A, but if you have other ideas, or better yet if you want to do some talks, please let me know. I think the event will be fun.\n\nIf you plan on coming, please drop me a note, so that we can get some sense of the attendance.\n\nWhen: September 6th, 18:30\n\nWhere: Auditorium 1, Nokia Denmark A/S, København ( map)\n\nFood will be provided.","title":"Copenhagen Hudson User Meetup","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":"4e8f1e15-fa1f-5d4d-a8b5-f848a400e7f7","slug":"/blog/2010/08/31/hudson-at-javazone-meetup-in-oslo/","strippedHtml":"JavaZone is a big Java conference in Scandinavia, and Hudson is well represented there.

So in that spirit, InfraDNA will be organizing a Hudson User Meetup at The Scotsman from Sep 8th 19:30 ( website.) We’ll get together, have some drinks, and enjoy geeky conversations.\n\nSo if you are local or visiting Oslo for JavaZone, come join us.
