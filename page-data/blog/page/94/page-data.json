It’s been a long time since I’ve written for the Hudson community, but now I’m back and ready to tackle some of the latest developments in the Hudson community.\n\nWhat is Hudson Labs?\n\nAs you may have read in April, Kohsuke left Oracle to found InfraDNA, a company specializing around Hudson. The departure meant the Hudson community would no longer have access to some of the hardware and services that Kohsuke had accumulated over the years working on Hudson at Sun Microsystems. While we are still happily part of the Java.net community, we’ve recognized the need for some community-owned resources and Hudson Labs was born.\n\nOver the past couple months, a group within the Hudson community, \"infra\" (short for \"infrastructure\"), has been working to get machines set up and build the foundation for a more open Hudson project infrastructure.\n\nWhat does Hudson Labs provide?\nBuilds\n\nOne of the first tasks we set upon when building out Hudson Labs was to start improving the build and release process of Hudson by moving as much of it into a public Hudson instance. Building Hudson itself, plugins and dependencies of the Hudson project, the Hudson Labs instance will help improve the reliability of the Hudson ecosystem across the board, and should serve as a useful tool for core and plugin developers.\n\nMirroring\n\nThanks to the great team over at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab ( OSUOSL), we’ve been able to build out mirroring infrastructure for Hudson to provide fast access to native packages and wars alike. Currently the OSUOSL only has mirrors inside the continental United States, so we’re reaching out to friends in Asia and Europe to extend the mirroring system.\n\nInformation\n\nI’m currently working on re-working some of the blog posts you may have read over four months as more structured tutorials. I hope to provide an easily accessible knowledge-base for developing Hudson along with configuring Hudson for various platforms and development environments; this is a more difficult task so all the pieces aren’t entirely in place for this just yet.\n\nTo be honest, I’m very enthusiastic about Hudson’s future. Now that InfraDNA is up and running, Kohsuke’s renewed focus combined with the foundation of Hudson Labs and the uncommonly hospitable Hudson developer and user communities, the future is looking bright!","title":"Welcome to Hudson Labs!","tags":["general","meta","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

The first post over on Kohsuke.org welcomes us:\n\nFor the longest time I haven’t really done anything about kohsuke.org, but as I left Sun/Oracle, I decided to put a bit more effort into it.

Behold, the first release of Hudson ever made by a not-employed-by-Sun Kohsuke (as we covered last week). This iteration of Hudson contains only bug fixes, check the listing below for the specifics on which bugs have been fixed (1.355 is looking like it will contain a number of fixes as well). The release of 1.354 comes slightly later than usual given some of the logistics that needed to, or still need to be resolved.\n\nOne of the infrastructure issues that’s half-way resolved is the question of Debian/Ubuntu packages. Kohuske has packages uploaded in an experimental apt repository on hudson-labs.org which you can try out. That said, it’s not entirely clear whether this is going to be the preferred means of distributing native Debian/Ubuntu packages in the future (your mileage may vary).\n\nBugs fixed\n\nPOM parsing was still using the module root as the base for relative paths for alternate settings files. ( issue 6080)\n\nFix dynamic updates of build history table when CSRF protection is turned on. ( issue 6072)\n\nImproved the error reporting mechanism in LDAP setting.\n\nRaw console output contains garbage. ( issue 6034)\n\nFixed a file handle leak in the agents connection. ( issue 6137)\n\nQuiet period wasn’t taking effect properly when doing parameterized builds.\n\nContributors\n\nThe release of 1.354 contains a total of 51 commits to the \"core\" part of the tree, from 9 different contributors\n\nabayer\n\ndrulli\n\nkohsuke\n\nmanuel_carrasco\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nswiest\n\nvlatombe\n\nwyukawa\n+\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.354 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links","releases"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

One of the positive changes that came out shortly after the meet up was the support for \"Concurrent Builds\", allowing a job to be executed concurrently on different agents, a precursor to pre-tested commit support. Fervor for the pre-tested commit feature lowered as time went on, the feature being too dependent on the SCM itself was generally accepted as the reasoning behind the feature languishing.\n\nChances are the feature is in fact too large for Hudson to support alone. It requires Hudson, the SCM and likely a third tool to work in concert together to perform such a feat.\n\nWith Git, and the phenomenal code review tool Gerrit, and the Gerrit plugin by intrepid plugin developer, Jyrki Puttonen, pre-tested commits with Hudson, Git and Gerrit are possible.\nFor Git users more familiar with the distributed Git workflows, working with Gerrit should seem familiar. Gerrit has JGit, a Java implementation of Git embedded within it, along with an sshd stack, meaning Gerrit can masquerade as a \"regular\" Git remote repository. Developers can push and pull to the repository just as they can with any other Git repository (provided they have permissions of course). I won’t delve too much into using Gerrit specifically here, but the pre-tested workflow with Gerrit and Hudson would look something like this:\n\nDev creates a topic branch to work on a change\n\nCode is written (and hopefully tested) and committed locally\n\nDev pushes commit(s) to Gerrit\n\nHudson job (set to Poll SCM) picks up the patch, runs the job and marks it as \"+1 Verified\" or \"-1 Fails\"\n\nIf the job fails or is unstable, the change should be reworked or corrected (typically with git-rebase(1))\n\nIf Hudson says the change is good to go, it can be cherry-picked or pulled directly from Gerrit.\n\nFor example: image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/gerrit_patch.png\n\nTo learn more about Gerrit, check out the project page on Google Code; information on the Gerrit plugin can be found on the wiki.","title":"Pre-tested commits with Git","tags":["infrastructure","feedback","jobs","tutorial"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

In an effort to address these concerns, the Hudson core team has https://web.archive.org/web/ /https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/just-kidding.jpg[announced] a roadmap for Hudson 2.0.\n\nIn a message to the dev@ mailing list, Kohsuke said of Hudson 2.0:\n\nAs it stands now Hudson 1.0 is a good proof of concept, it’s time to take the lessons learned and build a truly solid enterprise-ready continuous integration server\nSome notable points from Kohsuke’s announcement with regards to the Hudson 2.0 roadmap, which is expected to ship late Q4 2011, are:\n\nImplementation of core in portable C for greater speed and code readability\n\nSelection of a better license, namely the WTFPL\n\nRevamped storage architecture around the Oracle 11g Database to provide more optimal synergy over flat XML files.\n\nEmbedding the Mono, Python, V8 and Lua engines allowing plugins to be written in C#, Python, JavaScript or Lua.\n\nAdoption of the Hudson Eagle as a mascot instead of the butler\n\n\"Social\" support will be merged into core, integrating Hudson directly with Facebook so you can share test failures with your friends.\n\nHudson 2.0 is expected to follow in the intrepid footsteps of other major revamps such as Netscape 5 and Perl 6 in its ambitiousness and innovation.","title":"Announcing the Hudson 2.0 Roadmap","tags":["just for fun","meta"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Either I have very high standards, or I’m terribly unfunny.\n\nThe web is awash with April Fool’s articles, comics, headlines and everything else, so instead I’m going to just give you a few useful links.\n\nA couple of Twitter links\n\nBesides the @hudsonci account, you can also follow a couple of Hudson’s more notable (or was it notorious?) hackers, such as our benevolent dictator, Kohsuke Kawaguchi. Ben Shine from Yahoo! who’s been working pretty hard on making Hudson prettier. Then there’s John Ferguson Smart who’s been working on a Hudson book. Of course I’ve tried to collect as many Hudson contributors as possible in the @contributors Twitter list.\n\nHacking Hudson\n\nWhen starting to hack Hudson, it’s useful to start by understanding how to build Hudson. If hacking Hudson’s core isn’t your cup of tea, you can always start with the plugin tutorial and try your hand at writing another awesome Hudson plugin. If you find yourself struggling to find out what methods do what while you’re hacking, you can always visit the regularly updated, online Javadocs for Hudson\n\nCommunicate\nThe two primary mediums for communicating with the Hudson community are through the mailing lists and the IRC channel. During \"regular business hours\" for the pacific standard time zone, you can usually get some decent real-time help or answers to most of your queries.\n\nI’d list more, but I’m too busy reading about Google’s nuclear weapons program. ;)","title":"Regarding the start of April","tags":["meta"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
