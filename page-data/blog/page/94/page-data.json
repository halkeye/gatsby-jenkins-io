I say that he is leaving Sun, instead of leaving Oracle as Kohsuke worked at Sun for nine years and Oracle only a few months. In those nine years at Sun, Kohsuke has worked on some great products, the most notable of them being Hudson.\n\nPer Kohsuke’s post:\n\nWhere am I heading next? I’m actually starting my own company to take Hudson to the next stage.\n\nWhat this means for Hudson still isn’t certain yet, fortunately it means that Hudson will continue to have at least one full-time developer. It remains to be seen where KohsukeCorp (the name has not yet been disclosed) will focus within the Hudson code-base. For the greater user-base of Hudson, this means that the schedule for releases may slow down during this transitional period, there are some logistics to work out with Oracle regarding some of the hardware Hudson has traditionally used to host JIRA, this blog, and a number of other machines helping support the Hudson project in one fashion or another.\n\nThe next couple of months will be interesting for the Hudson community; as per usual you’ll be able to get the latest updates from this blog or the @hudsonci twitter account. I’ll let Kohsuke finish this post off:\n\nAnd finally, big thank you to everyone in the Hudson community, and in a broader java.net community. I wouldn’t be here without you guys, and I feel very proud that I’m a part of it.","title":"Kohsuke leaves Sun","tags":["core","feedback","just for fun"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

In an effort to address these concerns, the Hudson core team has https://web.archive.org/web/ /https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/just-kidding.jpg[announced] a roadmap for Hudson 2.0.\n\nIn a message to the dev@ mailing list, Kohsuke said of Hudson 2.0:\n\nAs it stands now Hudson 1.0 is a good proof of concept, it’s time to take the lessons learned and build a truly solid enterprise-ready continuous integration server\nSome notable points from Kohsuke’s announcement with regards to the Hudson 2.0 roadmap, which is expected to ship late Q4 2011, are:\n\nImplementation of core in portable C for greater speed and code readability\n\nSelection of a better license, namely the WTFPL\n\nRevamped storage architecture around the Oracle 11g Database to provide more optimal synergy over flat XML files.\n\nEmbedding the Mono, Python, V8 and Lua engines allowing plugins to be written in C#, Python, JavaScript or Lua.\n\nAdoption of the Hudson Eagle as a mascot instead of the butler\n\n\"Social\" support will be merged into core, integrating Hudson directly with Facebook so you can share test failures with your friends.\n\nHudson 2.0 is expected to follow in the intrepid footsteps of other major revamps such as Netscape 5 and Perl 6 in its ambitiousness and innovation.","title":"Announcing the Hudson 2.0 Roadmap","tags":["just for fun","meta"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Either I have very high standards, or I’m terribly unfunny.\n\nThe web is awash with April Fool’s articles, comics, headlines and everything else, so instead I’m going to just give you a few useful links.\n\nA couple of Twitter links\n\nBesides the @hudsonci account, you can also follow a couple of Hudson’s more notable (or was it notorious?) hackers, such as our benevolent dictator, Kohsuke Kawaguchi. Ben Shine from Yahoo! who’s been working pretty hard on making Hudson prettier. Then there’s John Ferguson Smart who’s been working on a Hudson book. Of course I’ve tried to collect as many Hudson contributors as possible in the @contributors Twitter list.\n\nHacking Hudson\n\nWhen starting to hack Hudson, it’s useful to start by understanding how to build Hudson. If hacking Hudson’s core isn’t your cup of tea, you can always start with the plugin tutorial and try your hand at writing another awesome Hudson plugin. If you find yourself struggling to find out what methods do what while you’re hacking, you can always visit the regularly updated, online Javadocs for Hudson\n\nCommunicate\nThe two primary mediums for communicating with the Hudson community are through the mailing lists and the IRC channel. During \"regular business hours\" for the pacific standard time zone, you can usually get some decent real-time help or answers to most of your queries.\n\nI’d list more, but I’m too busy reading about Google’s nuclear weapons program. ;)","title":"Regarding the start of April","tags":["meta"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

If the problem persists next week, I’ll find a better way to dig up information on particularly releases that doesn’t depend on the GitHub mirror.\n\nBugs fixed\n\nTagging a repository can result in NPE.\n\nFix possible form submission error when using multiple combobox elements. ( issue 6025)\n\nBetter escaping of test case names in test results pages. ( issue 5982)\n\nMake radio buttons work in repeatable content, such as a build step. ( issue 5028)\n\nFixed the handling of verifying that the POM path entered for Maven projects exists. ( issue 4693)\n\nEnhancements\n\nAdded link to builds in buildTimeTrend ( issue 3993)\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.353 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

I use Hudson to build and test a number of pure Python modules and C extensions across numerous Python versions (covering 2.4 - 3.1). For most beginners, or those simply looking to get started with Python on Hudson, starting with my job configurations is too much at once, so instead I wanted to start at the \"beginning\" so to speak.\n\nThe trouble with getting people started with Hudson, given how simple and visual it is to use, is that articles with sample configurations are not particularly useful; a screencast however is a good medium for visually walking somebody through Hudson. The screencast below ( also on YouTube) is the first in a series of screencasts I’ll be doing, not only for Python on Hudson, but for Hudson overall.

Could you please share your experience?\n\nIt seems, to me at least, the notion of \"release engineering\" is making a come-back, particularly in the aging \"Web 2.0\" world where companies like Digg, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc are anywhere from five to ten years old. As these companies have aged a couple of important things have happened, their code-base has aged increasing the possibility of bitrot, but they have also expanded in terms of headcount. Start-ups that might have once slighted larger corporations like Oracle, Cisco VMWare and IBM for their burdensome process and longer release schedules now find themselves ensnared with massive code bases, larger development teams and complicated deployments. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_vs_buildbot.png\n\nOver the past few months we’ve seen Hudson being used in a number of different contexts, it was pitched at PyCon as part of a larger appeal to the Python community to get on the continuous integration bandwagon, we’ve seen a few posts from developers using Hudson for testing and packaging Android and iPhone apps, .NET developers are jumping on board as well. Across the board it feels like Hudson is being more and more widely used, it is no longer the mainstay of the Java shop’s toolkit, it’s become a must have for all developers.\n\nWith the allure of continuous deployment and Hudson’s lowered barrier to entry for testing, packaging and automating releases, is release engineering making a comeback?","title":"Resurgence of Releng","tags":["guest post","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
