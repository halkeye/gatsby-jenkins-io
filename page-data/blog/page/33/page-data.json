Previously, when\nupgrading to Jenkins Pipeline, converting Freestyle Jobs required developers\nto drill down on each one of those hundreds (or thousands!)  of jobs to understand\ntools, configurations, URLs, parameters, and more before rewriting them in\nPipeline syntax. This process is very manual,\nerror-prone, lengthy, and not cost-effective. Beyond saving time, the new\nplugin also assures adherence to proper coding standards and separates complex\nbusiness logic and standards declaration from execution flow.\n\nKey features:\n\nConvert single freestyle job to pipeline\n\nConvert chain of freestyle jobs to single pipeline\n\nWorks with both Jenkins and CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise\n\nPlugin can be customized to support any Freestyle plugin and an\norganization’s Pipeline Shared Library,\nor Groovy coding standards.\n\nWorks with CloudBees' Role-based Access Control to help the new Pipelines\ncomply with existing security policies.\n\nDirect migration of properties such as \"Build with Parameters\" to newly\ncreated Pipelines.\n\nDirect migration of Agent on which job is to be run with support for multiple agent labels across different downstream jobs\n\nEnvironment properties: JDK, NodeJS\n\nSupports Git SCM.\n\nBuild steps: Maven, Ant, Shell, Batch, and Ansible Playbook.\n\nPost build actions: artifact archiver, simple mailer, TestNG reports, JUnit reports, checkstyle publisher\n\nNow, let’s take a look at how to get started:\n\nClick on a link at Root level or Folder level or Job level.\n\nSelect the job from the drop-down list that is the beginning point of the\n\"chain\". If job level link is clicked, this drop-down list will not be visible.\n\nProvide the new pipeline job name. If this is not specified, the plugin will\nattempt to create a new pipeline job with the naming convention of\n\"oldname-pipeline\".\n\nCheck \"Recursively convert downstream jobs if any?\" if you wish to have all the\ndownstream jobs converted into this new pipeline. The plugin will write all the\nlogic of current and downstream jobs into a single pipeline.\n\nCheck \"Commit Jenkinsfile?\" if you would like the plugin to create a\nJenkinsfile and commit it back to the SCM. The plugin will commit the\nJenkinsfile at the root of the SCM repository it finds in the first job\n(selected in step 1 above). It will attempt to commit to this repo using the\ncredentials it finds in the first job.\n\nDo note that the plugin will checkout the repo in to a temporary workspace on\nthe controller (JENKINS_HOME/plugins/convert-to-    pipeline/ws). Once the\nconversion is complete and Jenkinsfile is committed back to the repo, the\nworkspace will be deleted.\n\nClick \"Convert\" to convert the Freestyle job configurations to a single\nscripted pipeline job. Once the conversion is complete and the new job is\ncreated, you will be redirected to the newly created pipeline job.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo learn more about plugin usage, customization and to see a demo\nclick here\nto watch the webinar replay on-demand.","title":"Auto-Convert Freestyle Jobs to Jenkins Pipeline","tags":["pipeline","freestyle"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Director of Labs &amp; Strategic Insights, Infostretch</p>\n</div>","id":"spillai","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sanil Pillai","slug":"/blog/authors/spillai/","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":"46206425-c22d-532b-b23f-d107881ab35a","slug":"/blog/2017/12/14/security-update/","strippedHtml":"We just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.95 and 2.89.2, that fix two security vulnerabilities.\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\n\nWe usually announce core security updates well in advance on the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list, to give Jenkins administrators time to schedule a maintenance.\nAdditionally, we try to align security updates with the regular LTS schedule.\nWe have chosen not to do so in this case for two reasons:\n\nThe random failure to set up Jenkins is very noticeable, and given that we’ve seen automated exploits for unprotected Jenkins instances in the past we consider it important to fix that issue as soon as possible, so that users setting up new instances of Jenkins can be confident they won’t start up insecurely.\n\nThe CSRF issue appears to only affect instances for a very short (seconds at most, if at all) time period immediately after startup, so administrators could apply the fix during the next scheduled Jenkins downtime, rather than immediately.","title":"Security updates for Jenkins core","tags":["core","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and, as security officer, leads the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck/","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","id":"052134b8-bf47-5261-8b6e-17041407d5e3","slug":"/blog/2017/12/04/jenkins-user-conference-china-recap/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Forest Jing, who runs\nthe Shanghai Jenkins Area Meetup\n\nThe first Jenkins User Conference China was held on November 19, 2017 in\nShanghai, China.

All of them are fans of Jenkins and Kohsuke.  Thanks to Kohsuke, he made a wonderful presentation to show the past, present and future of Jenkins for Chinese Jenkins users.\n\nThe co-founder of DevOps Times community, Le Zhang released a report of adoption of Deployment Pipeline in Chinese IT organization.\nThe report shows that Jenkins is the most popular tool for DevOps and CD in China.\n\nIt also has proven that “If it hurts, do it more often!” is right because the IT organization who deploy more frequently, deployment  failure would be less.\n\nThe Three Musketeers of DevOps in China (Le Zhang, Xuefeng Shi,Forest Jing) have demonstrated a DevOps pipeline based on Jenkins and many open-source software such as Kubernetes, Gitlab, etc.\n\nAfter the presentation, lots of fans waited in line to take pictures with Kohsuke.\n\nHere are some photos of the JUC China.

I’ve always been passionate about technical writing\nand more recently, the technologies that go into developing written content and\nautomating its generation - like Jenkins! I was a former Atlassian and recently\njoined CloudBees as a Senior Technical Writer, working remotely from the \"Sydney\nOffice\", with my current focus on the Jenkins User Documentation.\n\nWhy tutorials?\n\nMy exposure to Jenkins and its usage over the years has been patchy at best.\nDuring this time, however, I’ve had some degree of experience as a user of\nvarious continuous delivery (CD) tools like Jenkins and am reasonably familiar\nwith the advantages these tools can offer software development teams.\n\nI’ve also found that while many software developers are familiar with the\nbroader concept of \"developer operations\" (or simply \"devops\"), fewer seem\nfamiliar with the concepts of CD and related tools to facilitate devops within\norganizations.\n\nThe CD process is based on the fundamental flow of building the application\ntesting it delivering it, where typically:\n\nThe building part involves compiling the application and/or ensuring all\nnecessary libraries and dependencies are in place for the application to run\nas intended.\n\nThe testing part involves testing the built application with automated tests\nto ensure that changes implemented by developers function as expected.\n\nThe delivering part involves packaging or presenting the application in a\nway that can be delivered to customers or other users for any kind of purpose.\n\nNow, as one of the major contributors to the Jenkins User Documentation (and\nfaced with a reasonably steep learning curve), it quickly became apparent about\nthe lack of accessible documentation to hand-hold people relatively new to\nJenkins through this CD process. I couldn’t find anything in the Jenkins User\nDocumentation to demonstrate how Jenkins implements this process on a simple\napp that delivers an end result.\n\nWith the guidance and assistance of helpful colleagues, I therefore decided to\nembark on creating a series of Jenkins tutorials to help fill these\ndocumentation and knowledge gaps. These tutorials are based on Daniele Procida’s\ndescription of how tutorials should be presented in his blog post\n\" What nobody tells you about\ndocumentation\").\n\nIntroductory tutorials\n\nThe first set of tutorials on the Tutorials overview page\ndemonstrate how to implement this fundamental CD process in Jenkins on a simple\napplication for a given technology stack.\n\nSo far, there’s one for\nJava with Maven and another\nfor Node.js and\nReact with npm. Another for Python will be added to this list in the near\nfuture.\n\nThese tutorials define your application’s entire CD process (i.e. your Pipeline)\nin a Jenkinsfile, whose Groovy-like Declarative Pipeline syntax is checked in\nto your Git source repository. Managing your Pipeline with your application’s\nsource code like this forms the fundamentals of \"Pipeline as code\".\n\nThe Introductory tutorials also cover how to use some powerful features of\nJenkins, like Blue Ocean,\nwhich makes it easy to connect to an existing cloud, web or locally hosted Git\nrepository and create your Pipeline with limited knowledge of Pipeline syntax.\n\nAdvanced tutorials\n\nAlso soon to be released will be the first Advanced tutorial on building\nmultibranch Pipelines in Jenkins. This tutorial takes the \"Pipeline as code\"\nconcept to a new level, where a single Jenkinsfile (defining the entire CD\nprocess across all branches of your application’s Git repository) consists of\nmultiple stages which are selectively executed based on the branch that Jenkins\nis building.\n\nAdditional tutorials that demonstrate more advanced features of Jenkins and how\nto manage your Pipelines with greater sophistication and flexibility will be\nadded to this section in future.\n\nSumming up\n\nYou can access all currently available tutorials from the\nTutorials overview page in the Jenkins User Documentation.\nIt’s worthwhile checking that page from time to time as it’ll be updated\nwhenever a new tutorial is published.\n\nAlso, if you have any suggestions for tutorials or other content you’d like to\nsee in the documentation, please post your suggestions in the\nJenkins\nDocumentation Google Group, which you can also post (and reply) to by emailing\njenkinsci-docs@googlegroups.com.\n\nThe Sydney Office team meeting at Carriageworks -
