Bundled with this release was another localizations drop including translations for ca, es, fi, fr, hi_IN, it, nl, ru, and sv_SE locales. In addition to the nice fancy new community contributed translations, which you can help with by installing the Translation Assistance plugin, the 1.352 release includes the subtle enhancement of hyperlinking URLs in the console output.\n\nIn general, 1.352 is looking like a very solid release, that said, here’s the breakdown for this release:\n\nBugs fixed\n\nFixed a file handle leak when a copy fails. ( issue 5899)\n\nReplace '>' with '_' in username, as already done for '<'. ( issue 5833)\n\nFix editableComboBox to select item when mouse click takes more than 100ms. ( issue 2722)\n\nFixed NPE when configuring a view without \"Regular expression\".\n\nPage shouldn’t scroll up when the user opens/closes a stack trace in the test failure report.\n\nFixed a bug where Hudson can put a wrong help file link. ( report)\n\nFixed Maven site goal archiving from agents. ( issue 5943)\n\nFixed a regression with NetBeans Hudson plugin progressive console output. ( issue 5941)\n\nFixed a situation where a failure in plugin start up can prevent massive number of job loss.\n\nEnhancements\n\nSupported JBoss EAP 5.0.0 GA. ( issue 5922)\n\nCLI commands on protected Hudson now asks a password interactively, if run on Java6.\n\nAdded CLI 'login' and 'logout' commands so that you don’t have to specify a credential for individual CLI invocation.\n\nURLs in the console output are now hyperlinks.\n\nImproved the URL annotation logic.\n\nAdd drag&drop support for f:repeatable lists and use this for the JDK/Ant/Maven installations in global config so these can be reordered.\n\nIntegrated a new round of community-contributed localizations (ca, es, fi, fr, hi_IN, it, nl, ru, and sv_SE locales.)\n\nContributors\n\nThis release contains 63 commits, from six different contributors including our very own Subversion-loving Mike Rooney (mcrooney).\n\nabayer\n\njglick\n\nkohsuke\n\nmcrooney\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.352 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","id":"e4d4ec45-99e5-5a32-914c-fe8d48418afa","slug":"/blog/2010/03/19/get-excited-and-make-things/","strippedHtml":"The day of hackery is upon us!

Of particular interest to users of Hudson’s various native packages for Red Hat, openSuSE, Ubuntu/Debian and Solaris, was a change that suppress the \"self-upgrade\" functionality in the \"Manage Hudson\" page. On the enhancements side of the fence, the team added authentication support to the Hudson CLI ( issue 3796) allowing Hudson users with locked down installations to take advantage of everything the CLI has to offer.\n\nInternal to Hudson, some more changes from Alan Harder (a.k.a mindless, a.k.a The Garbage Man), deprecating or otherwise removing deprecated APIs. Alan’s been doing some great work on Hudson’s internals, if you’re coming out to this weekend’s hackathon, but sure to pat him on the back for his tireless efforts.\n\nBug fixes\n\nFix handling of relative paths in alternate settings.xml path for Maven projects. ( issue 4693)\n\nAlternate settings, private repository, profiles, etc were not used in embedded Maven for deploy publisher. ( issue 4939)\n\nMake editableComboBox work in repeatable content, such as a build step.\n\nIf content is captured using ..content.. , fixed this to use proper HTML rendering when appropriate.\n\n'<' and '&' in the console output was not escaped since 1.349 ( issue 5852)\n\nFixed an AbstractMethodError in SCM polling under some circumstances. ( issue 5756)\n\nFixed a ClassCastException in the Subversion plugin - now using Subversion plugin 1.13. ( issue 5827)\n\nThe Maven Integration plugin link in the Update Center was going to a dead location. ( issue 4811)\n\nOn RPM/DEB/etc installation, don’t offer the self upgrade. It should be done by the native package manager. ( report)\n\nFixed a possible lock up of agents.\n\nEnhancements\n\nAdded advanced option to LogRotator to allow for removing artifacts from old builds without removing the logs, history, etc. ( issue 834)\n\nAuthentication support in Hudson CLI.
