Because the first rule of building an effective pipeline is to make sure you use agents.\nIf you’re using a Jenkins controller and haven’t defined any agents, then your first step should be to define at least one agent and use that agent instead of executing on the controller.\n\nFor the sake of maintaining scalability in your pipeline, the general rule is to avoid processing any workload on your controller.\nIf you’re running Jenkins jobs on the controller, you are sacrificing controller performance.\nSo, try to avoid using Jenkins controller capacity for things that should be passed off to an agent.\nThen, as you grow and develop, all of your work should be running agents.\nThis is why we always recommend setting the number of executors on the master to zero.\n\nUse Just Enough Pipeline to Keep Your Pipeline Scalable\n\nAll of this serves to highlight our overarching theme of “using just enough pipeline.”\nSimply put, you want to use enough code to connect the pipeline steps and integrate tools – but no more than that.\nLimit the amount of complex logic embedded in the Pipeline itself (similarly to a shell script), and avoid treating it as a general-purpose programming language.\nThis makes the pipeline easier to maintain, protects against bugs, and reduces the load on controllers.\n\nAnother best practice for keeping your pipeline lean, fast, and scalable is to use declarative syntax instead of scripted syntax for your Pipeline.\nDeclarative naturally leads you away from the kinds of mistakes we’ve just described.\nIt is a simpler expression of code and an easier way to define your job.\nIt’s computed at the startup of the pipeline instead of executing continually during the pipeline.\n\nTherefore, when creating a pipeline, start with declarative, and keep it simple for as long as possible.\nAnytime a script block shows up inside of a declarative pipeline, you should extract that block and put it in a shared library step.\nThat keeps the declarative pipeline clean.\nBy combining declarative with a shared library, that will take care of the vast majority of use cases you’ll encounter.\n\nThat said, it’s not accurate to say that declarative plus a shared library will solve every problem.\nThere are cases where scripted is the right solution.\nHowever, declarative is a great starting point until you discover that you absolutely must use scripted.\n\nJust remember, at the end of the day, you’ll do well to follow the adage: “Use just enough pipeline and no more.”\n\nThanks to our Sponsor\n\nMark and Darin both work

are many ways to set up your Jenkins environment, and depending on the configuration you choose, there are different best practices and options to optimize your environment.\nIn this blog, I’m going to focus on Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees as a way to fine-tune your environment.\nIt’s a free tool that can help administrators understand and manage their Jenkins controller.\nIf you’re a CloudBees customer, the tool automatically comes with CloudBees CI.\nHowever, it’s also available as a free open source tool to anyone who uses Jenkins.\nThe Jenkins Health Advisor tool can make your life easier, because it can arm you with the information you need to keep your Jenkins environment running smoothly.\n\nA Bit of Background\n\nThe CloudBees support team originally created the tool as a way to help customers troubleshoot Jenkins issues.\nWith the tool, our support engineers could gather information from a customer’s Jenkins controller about the configuration of the controller and agents, the operating system, stats from web requests, and the like.\nOur tech support teams used this data to help customers pinpoint problems, such as security vulnerabilities, performance problems, and plugin version issues.\nVery quickly, our support tooling team saw the bigger-picture benefits of the diagnostic tool as an opportunity for people to proactively manage their controller.\nWith that bit of background, let’s dive into the Jenkins Health Advisor tool so you understand how it can help you.\n\nThe Problem — Lack of Visibility into Controller Environment\n\nBecause of the open-source nature of Jenkins and the vast array of plugins that you can deploy in your Jenkins installation, downstream code changes to plugins and corresponding dependencies can inadvertently impact your environment, which slows productivity, causes confusion, and impacts the quality of your software delivery.\nWhen problems arise, Jenkins administrators need to quickly pinpoint the root cause of an issue, and that can be quite a challenge.\n\nThe Solution — Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees\n\nWhen an issue arises, you need razor sharp insight to help you quickly sift through lines upon lines of data about your Jenkins controller and your plugins to identify the problem.\nAnd, that’s exactly what Jenkins Health Advisor does.\nIt gives you specific information about potential problems in your environment so you can resolve issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen you first install the Jenkins Health Advisor tool in your environment, you’ll receive a report that lists everything it detects in your system.\nYou’ll then receive report emails only when something changes that could impact your environment or when the tool identifies an issue that could be problematic.\nIf there are no issues in your environment, you don’t receive an email.\nIt’s really that simple.\n\nThe Power is in the Insight … and the CloudBees Support\n\nOk, so let’s explain how Jenkins Health Advisor uses data to help you optimize your environment.\nThe tool actually generates a support bundle every 24 hours.\nWe don’t want to bog down your email inbox with redundant reports emails, so we don’t send every report to you—only the reports that indicate an issue with your environment.\nHowever, CloudBees receives every support bundle from every user.\nWe are constantly monitoring all of this active Jenkins controller data with external Jenkins and open source data about known issues, plugin updates, security vulnerabilities, etc.\nIf the Jenkins Health Advisor tool identifies an issue that could impact your system, you’ll receive an email so you can proactively address the problem.\nAt the same time, CloudBees engineering teams are continually working to enhance the detection capabilities of the Jenkins Health Advisor tool, so you can work as proactively as possible to manage your environment.\n\nThe emails you receive identify potential problems, and they also include supporting information to help you resolve issues, with links to solutions and recommended resolutions as well as articles to understand the problem.\n\nHelpful Tips to Gain Value from Jenkins Health Advisor\n\nImprove Troubleshooting\n\nIf you need to troubleshoot a particular issue, you can manually generate a support bundle to give you point-in-time information on your environment.\nYou can filter the support bundle data on different system parameters, like the build queue, dump agent export tables, and garbage collection logs, so you get the specific information you need.\n\nGenerate Anonymized System Data\n\nAt any time, you can change the settings on your tool to anonymize the data in your support bundles.\nYou may want to do this if you don’t want to share sensitive project data with CloudBees.\nOur support and engineering teams can still gain valuable insight from your generic system data.\nThis is also a helpful feature if you need to share system data with a partner or vendor, and you don’t want to share project or personnel data.\n\nJenkins Health Advisor Tool Updates and Support\n\nAs we mentioned above, the CloudBees support tooling team is constantly working to enhance the tool.\nTo ensure it’s always as current as possible, we release updates to the tool every two weeks.\nUsually these updates won’t impact your Jenkins environment.\nHowever, if there are changes to the tool that might affect your system, you’ll receive a notification email so there are no surprises.\nAnd, if you need help with the Jenkins Health Advisor tool, our support engineers are available to answer your questions.\n\nStart Using Jenkins Health Advisor Today\n\nGiven the vast Jenkins community, it’s impossible to know everything that may impact your environment, even if you look at your control panel every day and scour open source forums on a regular basis to stay on top of new issues and vulnerabilities.\nThe Jenkins Health Advisor tool is designed to streamline the work effort of your daily routine by automatically telling you when there’s an issue that may impact your Jenkins environment.\nWith the proactive Jenkins Health Advisor notifications, you can spend your time on more strategic tasks.\n\nInstall the plugin and enroll your controller with Jenkins Health Advisor today!","title":"Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees Tool Makes Life Easier for Jenkins

you’ve been following JenkinsIsTheWay.io, you’ve read some fantastic stories from the Jenkins user community about the great stuff they are building with Jenkins.\nWith over 200,000 installations to date, Jenkins remains the most widely used open-source automation server.\nAnd story after story, we hear what a critical role Jenkins plays in building robust, secure CI/CD pipelines.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that in many of the back (and remote) offices of Fortune 500 companies, developers are turning to Jenkins to help make their lives easier with automation while also giving their engineers more time to innovate.\nWith this in mind, I invite you to read the latest ebook focused on the behind-the-scenes development activities underway in large-scale enterprises.\n\nJenkins led\n\nLearn how companies like IBM continue to innovate their software prowess while confidently relying on their custom-built CI/CD pipelines.\nYou’ll also read how Jenkins became the ultimate collaboration tool for thousands of Apple developers.\nAnd we don’t just shine the spotlight on tech companies.\nIn this ebook, Jenkins users span multiple industries across the enterprise.\n\nYou’ll read how Jenkins made it possible to standardize multidisciplinary team procedures so Roche engineers can create innovative healthcare applications with confidence.\nWe also dive into how Telstra’s software team was able to automate the build cycle - across 100,000 microservices - to accelerate the creation of world-class communication tools.\nAnd how Sainsbury’s development team used Jenkins as the way to \"bring a retail giant into the 21st century\".\n\nResults inspired\n\nNo time to dive into this Fortune 500 ebook?\nI thought it’s worth highlighting the real-world results experienced by enterprise developers and engineers who have turned to awesome plugins to help build, deploy and automate their software solutions.\nHere’s what they had to say in their own words!\n\nSoftware acceleration\n\nBuild times are much faster with the new node mechanism\n\nShared build pipelines are consistent and evolve faster\n\nFaster deployment times - from 5 days to several minutes\n\nDeploy multiple server patches 30x faster than normal processes\n\nReduce release time from 7 to 4 days\n\nSimpler, smarter processes\n\nOne-stop-shop for building, deploying, monitoring, testing and even self-managing\n\nEasy onboarding for new applications\n\nCredential management has gotten much simpler and stricter\n\nMade setting up CI/CD really easy\n\nProvides the visibility needed to track the deployment process\n\nLoved and relied on by developers\n\nUltimate collaboration tool for thousands of developers\n\n100% confidence in a consistent and repeatable pipeline\n\nKeeps the DevOps team in the loop\n\nJenkins-as-code has freed teams up to experiment more\n\nTeams are more self-empowered to provision and support their own builds\n\nOne thing to remember is that since Jenkins is a free open source solution, it also means savings across the enterprise.\nThis is highlighted in several of our user stories in this ebook.\nYou’ll discover how peers have \"decreased build server costs\" and have mentioned \"cost-cutting\" as a top Jenkins benefit.\n\nShare your story\n\nWhether working for a large corporation or an emerging tech startup, we relish hearing your experiences and the results you get with a Jenkins assist.\nWhen you’re ready to tell your story, we’re prepared to help you share it.\nFill out our short questionnaire, and we’ll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt

all,\n\nTime flies and the Jenkins elections period is here.\n\nThis year, two board seats and all officer positions are up for election.\nThanks, Oleg Nenashev and Ullrich Hafner who led the Jenkins project as board members for the last two years.\nThanks, Tim Jacomb, Daniel Beck, Mark Waite for your dedication as officers over the past year.\n\nWe already had two successful editions in a row. I want us to continue on that path.\nThis is a tremendous opportunity for community members to influence the direction of the project for the next two years.\nTo make this year’s election even better, we slightly modified the process by leveraging our new community platform aka community.jenkins.io.\n\nTo participate in the election, we ask every Jenkins community member to have an account on community.jenkins.io.\nYou can either reuse your Github account or create a new discourse account specific to community.jenkins.io.\nThe second requirement is to be able to showcase at least one contribution done before the first of September 2021.\nAs mentioned on jenkins.io.io/participate, they are many different ways to contribute to Jenkins and for many of them, it’s very difficult to measure.\nTherefore we’ll trust participants and will not require that they provide evidence of contribution as part of their voter registration. We reserve the right to ban the specific account from the election process if we identify abuse.\nThe election works in three stages:\n\nIdentify voters and nominees\n\nVoting period\n\nAnnounce results\n\nVoters\n\nTo invite participants to vote, we need a list of email’s addresses that we would share with the Condorcet Internet Voting Service.\nTherefore we ask every community member who matches the requirements to join the group election-voter on community.jenkins.io.\nThe group will be open for joining during the registration period after we’ll close registration during the voting period.\nWe’ll use emails from the “election-voter” group members.\n\nNominees\n\nDuring the same period, we invite every community member to nominate candidates by sending a message to the group election-committee mentioning the position and the motivation.\nOn the 31 of October, the nomination period will end. We’ll notify all the nominees and get confirmation that they are interested in running as a candidate.\nThe list of candidates will be announced on the 7th of November.\n\nEverybody can nominate candidates.\n\nThis year we are looking for nominees for the following positions:\n\nBoard members\n\nDocumentation Officer\n\nEvents Officer\n\nInfrastructure Officer\n\nRelease Officer\n\nSecurity Officer\n\nMore information about the different roles can be found on jenkins.io/project/team-leads.\n\nElection\n\nOn the 7th of November, once voters and candidates are identified, we’ll invite everybody by email to vote using civs.cs.cornell.edu.\nAt this stage of the election, nobody will be allowed to register.\nVoting deadline is the 30th of November.\n\nResult\n\nAs soon as we have the election results, we’ll publish them.\nElected members will begin their official roles on the 3rd of December 2021.\n\nKey Dates\n\nSep 20: Nomination and voter registration begin\n\nOct 31: Nomination deadline\n\nNov 07: Candidates announced, Registration deadline, voting start\n\nNov 30: Voting deadline\n\nDec 03: Results announced\n\nKey Information:\n\nEverybody can suggest candidates by sending a private message to the group election-committee.\n\nVoters register for the election by joining the public group election-voter.\n\nEmail participants will be shared with Condorcet Voting System to send voting invitations.\n\nNobody can register for the election once we send invitations to Condorcet Voting System.\n\nOnce the election is over, every member of the group\"election-voter\" will get a badge on https://community.jenkins.io as a “2021 Election Participant”.\n\nOnce the election is over, every nominee will get the badge “2021 Election Nominee”.\n\nCheers,","title":"Jenkins Election

this week the Jenkins infrastructure team identified a successful attack against our deprecated Confluence service.\nWe responded immediately by taking the affected server offline while we investigated the potential impact.\nAt this time we have no reason to believe that any Jenkins releases, plugins, or source code have been affected.\n\nThus far in our investigation, we have learned that the Confluence CVE-2021-26084 exploit was used to install what we believe was a Monero miner in the container running the service.\nFrom there an attacker would not be able to access much of our other infrastructure.\nConfluence did integrate with our integrated identity system which also powers Jira, Artifactory, and numerous other services.\n\nThe trust and security in Jenkins core and plugin releases is our highest priority.\nWe do not have any indication that developer credentials were exfiltrated during the attack.\nAt the moment we cannot assert otherwise and are therefore assuming the worst.\nWe are taking actions to prevent releases at this time until we re-establish a chain of trust with our developer community.\nWe have reset passwords for all accounts in our integrated identity system.\nWe are improving the password reset system as part of this effort.\n\nAt this time, the Jenkins infrastructure team has permanently disabled the Confluence service, rotated privileged credentials, and taken proactive measures to further reduce the scope of access across our infrastructure.\nWe are working closely with our colleagues at the Linux Foundation and the Continuous Delivery Foundation to ensure that infrastructure which is not directly managed by the Jenkins project is also scrutinized.\n\nIn October 2019 we made the Confluence server read-only effectively deprecating it for day-to-day use within the project.\nAt that time, we began migrating documentation and changelogs from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\nThat migration has been ongoing, with hundreds of plugins and many other documentation pages moved from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\n\nWe are grateful for those of you who followed our responsible disclosure procedure and reached out to us about this vulnerability affecting the Jenkins project.\n\nWe will continue to take proactive measures to improve the security of our infrastructure and encourage you to follow us on Twitter for further updates.","title":"Jenkins project Confluence instance
