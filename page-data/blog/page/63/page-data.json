What happened?\n\nWe host parts of our infrastructure at the Open Source Lab at Oregon State (OSUOSL), including the databases for these two services. So far, there’s no post mortem by OSUOSL (they expect to post one later this week), so we need to piece together what we know.\n\nThe databases for the wiki and issue tracker became inaccessible around midnight/12 AM Thu/Fri night (all times UTC). Due to the large number and size of databases on that server, pulling from backups, restoring from backup and replaying the binlogs took them quite a while. During that time, we put up a maintenance screen on the wiki (and messed up the one for Jira, so there were connection timeouts instead).\n\nThe databases were back around 3 AM on Sunday. We disabled the maintenance screens around 6 PM later that day.\n\nWhile this was a rather lengthy outage, it could have been much worse. We lost none of the data, after all. We thank the OSUOSL team for their efforts getting everything back up over the weekend!","title":"Wiki and issue tracker outage over the weekend","tags":["infrastructure","meta"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and member of the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe was the inaugural Jenkins security officer from 2015 to 2021.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure in his spare time.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","id":"bb2d2ef6-e92c-5a0d-8cdb-5c975c9a4812","slug":"/blog/2015/08/03/just-a-month-left-until-juc-u-s-west/","strippedHtml":"There’s only a month left until JUC U.S. West on September 2-3!

Many users were therefore forced to keep using an older release of the plugin to keep their instances running.\n\nTo fix this difficult situation I’ve decided to dedicate my spare time to improving the plug-in and attempting to restore the stability that an essential plug-in like this requires.\n\nIn order to do so, me, my colleague Steven Christou and other members of the community have drawn up a plan.\n\nIn the coming weeks we will be focusing our efforts on:\n\nGoing through the Jira tickets\n\nChecking whether they are duplicated\n\nChecking whether they are still relevant\n\nAsking for more information from the people who reported them\n\nEstablishing their priority\n\nReviewing pull requests\n\nInvestigating bug reports and try to reproduce them\n\nFixing serious bugs\n\nRefactoring the plugin to improve its maintainability.\n\nWe’re planning to publish a new 2.5.x bugfix release once a fortnight. We are not considering the inclusion of new features or improvements. The priority now must be to obtain a stable and reliable plug-in, one that will allow us to take things up again in the future with greater security and peace of mind.\n\nInterested in helping?

In their own words:\n\nKubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions. Using the concepts of \"labels\" and \"pods\", it groups the containers which make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.\n\nKubernetes-related services by Google are the Google Container Engine, a Kubernetes-powered platform for hosting and managing Docker containers, and the Google Container Registry, a private Docker image registry.\n\nSeveral new Jenkins plugins allow you to make use of Kubernetes and these services:\n\nThe Google Cloud Registry Auth Plugin allows users to authenticate with the Google Cloud Registry so they can push/pull images. This allows you to use the Google Cloud Registry with existing Docker-related plugins, like Docker build step plugin or CloudBees Docker Custom Build Environment Plugin.\n\nThe Kubernetes Plugin implements a cloud provider for Jenkins, and can create agents based on Docker images on-demand on your Kubernetes cluster or the Google Cloud Platform.\n\nWatch Kohsuke demoing Jenkins/Kubernetes integration at OSCON earlier this week.\n\nFor a more in-depth look at how you can use Kubernetes with Jenkins, check out these posts on the CloudBees blog by Tracy Kennedy:\n\nOrchestrating deployments with Jenkins Workflow and Kubernetes\n\nOn-demand Jenkins agents with Kubernetes and the Google Container Engine\n\nClustering Jenkins with Kubernetes in the Google Container Engine","title":"Integrating Kubernetes and Jenkins","tags":["general","plugins","video"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and member of the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe was the inaugural Jenkins security officer from 2015 to 2021.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure in his spare time.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d17bd5cd-f3ec-583a-89df-90a6e0487eca","slug":"/blog/2015/07/24/juc-u-s-east-slides-and-video-are-now-available-online/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/dc_0.jpg[image,width=200,height=149] +\n\n+\n+\n\nSlides and video from JUC U.S. East are now available online!\n\n+\n+\n\nIf you attended the conference, THANK YOU, and I’m sure you had fun, learned a lot and met many people from the Jenkins community.
