We invite you to explore them all but wanted to share three inspiring examples highlighting how various organizations approach — and implement — Jenkins in the workplace. Enjoy!\n\nStory 1: Jenkins is the way to tackle any challenge\n\nEnterprise-wide CI/CD solution caters to the complex problems that project teams face each day, as told by Jenkins user Mark Baumann:\n\n“Our development teams work in a wide range of projects and domains. We have a very diverse tooling landscape since the projects work with all kinds of different software tools. Of course, projects in the embedded domain will have different toolsets than those working in the automotive domain.\n\nEach project team created its own CI Toolchain, which caused a lot of work for the developers and the IT department. Each project needed to set up their own virtual machine, install and manage their own CI Server, Version Management, and whatever they needed. Creating such a toolchain could easily take up weeks until it was running because there was no standard solution and each team had to start from scratch.”\n\nDiscover how ITK-Engineering GmbH developed a company-wide, common, internal CI/CD toolchain and increased the number of builds for each project and how nearly all departments are now practicing CI/CD. The full Jenkins / ITK Engineering story is here!\n\nStory 2: Jenkins is the way to add spicy flavors to agency processes\n\nA creative agency start-up simplifies the build, test, and deploy steps, allowing the small team to focus more on the deliverables and less on the process. As told by Jenkins user Erik Woitschig:\n\n“It was quite a challenge to streamline and combine all the services to build an artifact to deploy. Because of our micro service-oriented and distributed architecture, the most challenging part of rethinking our build, test, and deploy process was to figure out how best to sync the deployment of all services. We also had to retest builds properly to go live or initiate a rollback.\n\nWith Jenkins and some pipelines, it was relatively simple to create a local and distributed artifact of our application to quickly share and deploy across the team, locally and globally.”\n\nBecause Jenkins is simple to install and easy to maintain, Muzkat has increased productivity far beyond that of a 3-person team. Read on to learn how this bootstrapped Berlin-based agency is making a go of it with Jenkins. The full Jenkins / Muzkat story is here!\n\nStory 3: Jenkins is the way to focus on your code\n\nAs demands for the Wright Medical’s services grew, they required an agile DevOps environment that would grow and scale along with the tech team, as told by Jenkins user Christophe Carpentier:\n\n“What was critical to our success was the stability of Jenkins and a significant number of reliable plugins! We could take a few plugins, set up our workflow, and add GitLab and SonarQube integration without ever stopping or losing data in over a year. We found that all of the problems we encountered were our own, and that is why it was critical to make Jenkins an essential part of our workflow.\n\nWith this implementation, Jenkins allows more than would be manually possible. It flawlessly updates our staging environments, blocks commits based on the SonarQube analysis, and provides us with near-instant feedback on merge requests.”\n\nLearn how Wright Medical supports a growing dev team by switching to an agile DevOps process that allows for automatic daily releases — versus weekly manual builds. Best of all, it’s letting the developers focus on building great code rather than infrastructure. The full Jenkins / Wright Medical story is here!\n\nWhat are you building?\n\nHope you enjoy these Jenkins user stories. You’ll find that “Jenkins Is The Way” website is a global showcase of how developers and engineers build, deploy, and automate great stuff with Jenkins. If you want to share your story, we’ll send you a free Jenkins Is The Way T-Shirt in return.

I started contributing to Jenkins documentation during the technical writer\nexploration phase for Google Season of Docs 2020 and I must say, my journey so far\nhas been nothing short of amazing majorly because of the supportive community behind this project.\nI chose the Jenkins project because I understood this project from a user point of view as I had been exposed to setting up, configuring,\nand using Jenkins to automate CI/CD processes. I piqued interest in two of Jenkins project ideas,\nPlugin documentation migration and update and Document Jenkins on Kubernetes, submitted proposals for these two projects and to my utmost joy, the latter was selected.\n\nIn this article, I’m going to be explaining what my selected project is about and why this project is important to the Jenkins community and its users.\n\nIntroduction\n\nKubernetes is a platform-agnostic container orchestration tool created by Google and heavily supported\nby the open-source community as a project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.\nIt allows you to use container instances and manage them for scaling and fault tolerance.\nIt also handles a wide range of management activities that would otherwise require separate solutions or custom code,\nincluding request routing, container discovery, health checks, and rolling updates.\n\nKubernetes is compatible with the majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests,\ndeploy builds in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.\nOne of the most popular CI/CD tools now is Jenkins for the following reasons:\n\nIt is open-source and free.\n\nit is user-friendly, easy to install and does not require additional installations or components.\n\nJenkins is also quite easy to configure, modify and extend.\n\nIt deploys code and generates test reports.\n\nIt also boasts a rich plugin ecosystem. The extensive pool of plugins makes Jenkins flexible and allows building, deploying and automating across various platforms.\n\nJenkins can be configured according to the requirements for continuous integrations and continuous delivery.\n\nJenkins is available for all platforms and different operating systems, whether it is OS X, Windows or Linux.\n\nMost of the integration work is automated. Hence fewer integration issues. This saves both time and money over the lifespan of a project.\n\nThe following reasons have made Jenkins on Kubernetes a popular theme for Jenkins users, however,\nthere’s currently no central location for documentation describing Jenkins on Kubernetes,\nthereby making it difficult for Jenkins on Kubernetes users to navigate and find information.\nThis project would create a new Kubernetes Volume on Jenkins.io which would describe the concepts,\ntechniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins.\n\nCurrent State\n\nThere are a lot of presentations and articles about running Jenkins on Kubernetes, however,\nthere’s no central location for describing Jenkins on Kubernetes. This makes it difficult for:\n\nJenkins on Kubernetes users to navigate and find information\n\nTrack, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nProject Improvements\n\nTo solve the existing issue with Jenkins on Kubernetes documentation,\na new Kubernetes volume will be created on Jenkins.io.\nThis Volume is going to aggregate user guides, information on cloud providers and demos on Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nYou can find the proposed contents for the new volume here.\nFeel free to comment on any suggestions you might have in the proposed content doc.\n\nThis project will also provide the following advantages:\n\nImprove the user experience of Jenkins on Kubernetes users by giving them a one-stop-shop for information on Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nMake it easy to track, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes using the Solutions page\n\nReference the existing community documentation for Jenkins on K8s (plugins and tools/integrations).\n\nHow to guides, tutorials and explanations of concepts and techniques in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nJust-In-Time documentation which means that rather than documenting every feature comprehensively,\nwe will produce and release documentation in bits but continuously based on popular questions,\nfeedback and area of interests gathered from the community and users.\n\nProject Timeline\n\nFind below a summary of the project timeline.\n\nCommunity bonding ( August 17 - September 13 )\n\nSet up a communication channel and time (due to time difference).\n\nRefine my goals and set expectations on both sides.\n\nLearn more about the community and Jenkins.\n\nGather and thoroughly study existing resources that will be useful and helpful to the project.\n\nPre-planning of the project\n\nContacting Stakeholders and onboarding contributors\n\nDocumentation Period\n\nThis period is going to be focused on creating contents which include user guides,\ntutorials, demos, etc. for Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nSome of the topics to be covered include Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes,\nAdministering Jenkins on Kubernetes, Cloud providers and much more.\n\nDocumentation Timeline\n\n1st Month (September - October)\n\nSome basic prerequisites for installing jenkins on kubernetes include docker, a kubernetes cluster, and optionally Helm or the Jenkins Operator for Kubernetes.\n\nHelm is a package manager which automates the process of installing, configuring, upgrading, and removing complex Kubernetes application. A Helm chart defines several Kubernetes resources as a set. Helm can make deployments easier and repeatable because all resources for an application are deployed by running one command.\n\nHelm has two elements, a client (helm) and a server (Tiller). The server element runs inside a Kubernetes cluster and manages the installation of charts. With Helm, configuration settings are kept in values.yaml file separate from the manifest formats. The configuration values can be changed according to application need without touching the rest of the manifest.\n\nOn the other hand, the Jenkins operator is a Kubernetes native operator which fully manages Jenkins on Kubernetes. It is easy to install with just a few manifests and allows users to configure and manage Jenkins on Kubernetes. To run jenkins-operator, you need to have a running Kubernetes cluster and kubectl installed.\n\nThe Jenkins Operator provides out of the box:\n\nIntegration with Kubernetes — preconfigured kubernetes-plugin for provisioning dynamic Jenkins Slaves as Pods\n\nPipelines as Code — declarative way to version your pipelines in VCS\n\nExtensibility via Groovy scripts or Configuration as Code plugin-customize your Jenkins, configure OAuth authorization and more\n\nSecurity and Hardening — an initial security hardening of Jenkins instance via Groovy scripts to prevent security vulnerabilities\n\nIn the first month, the focus will be on documenting an introductory section.\nThis section will include but is not limited to Setting up Kubernetes cluster, Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes, exploring the various approaches by which this can be achieved such as using helm package manager or the Jenkins Operator as explained above and Administering Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\n2nd Month (October - November)\n\nIn the second month, the focus will be on documenting how to setup up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Kubernetes on different cloud providers.\nSome of the cloud providers we will be looking at include but are not limited to:\n\nAmazon Web Service (AWS)\n\nAzure Kubernetes Service\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\n3rd Month (November - December)\n\nIn the final month, the focus will be on creating demos and tutorials,\nsubmitting project report, evaluation of mentors and finally,\npublishing a report of my experience as a participant in Season of Docs.\n\nConclusion\n\nJenkins community is actively working towards improving its documentation to create a better\nexperience for Jenkins users and invites technical writers to join the community and contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes project.\n\nTo contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes project, simply join the Jenkins documentation Gitter channel and drop a message,\nyou can also find the Google season of docs office hour notes and recordings for Jenkins on Kubernetes here.\nGSOD office hours take place twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays between 6pm GMT+1 and 7pm GMT+1,\nif you would like to be part of these meetings, you can indicate interest in the Jenkins Documentation\nGitter channel and we would be happy to have you.\n\nIf you are also a newcomer and would like to contribute to Jenkins, documentation is a great place to contribute.\nA lot of small patches can be done from the GitHub web interface even without cloning repositories locally.\nYou can find some good first issues to get started with here.\n\nFind more information on contributing to Jenkins documentation here.\nIf you have further questions about the Jenkins on Kubernetes project or contributing to Jenkins,\nyou can reach out on the Jenkins documentation Gitter channel.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nGSoD Proposal\n\nGSoD Office Hours Notes\n\nGoogle Season of Docs - Startup\n\nGoogle Season of Docs on jenkins.io\n\nDocs SIG for Google Season of Docs startup ( video)","title":"Documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes Introduction","tags":["kubernetes","documentation","gsod","gsod2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"zaycodes","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Zainab is a software developer and technical writer who is passionate about contributing to open source, improving technical documentation and advocating for gender diversity in open source collaboration.

Just like other events this year, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that doesn’t mean there is a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There will be over 50 Jenkins/open source sessions and opportunities to virtually connect with over 20,000+ attendees on the event platform. Below are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :\n\nJenkins: Where It Is and Where It is Going\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 7:00 a.m.-7:30 a.m (PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Oleg Nenashev\n\nJenkins keeps evolving to address demands from its users and contributors: configuration as code, better support of cloud-native technologies, etc. Recently, we have introduced a public roadmap for the project, and there are many key initiatives in development and preview phases. This session will cover the current state of Jenkins and what’s next for the project.\n\nManaging DevSecOps Pipelines at Scale with Jenkins Templating Engine\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 11:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. (PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Steven Terrana\n\nAre you currently helping build or maintain a Jenkins pipeline for more than one application or team? Are you tired of copying and pasting Jenkinsfiles and tweaking them to fit each team’s specific needs? This session will feature a live demonstration of getting up and running with the Jenkins Templating Engine (JTE). Attendees will learn how to stop creating bespoke pipelines on a per-application basis and, instead, create tool-agnostic pipeline templates that multiple teams can inherit - regardless of tech stack.\n\neBay’s Journey Building CI at Scale\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 12:30 p.m.-1:00 p.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeakers: Ravi Kiran Rao Bukka & Vasumathy Seenuvasan\n\nA scalable CI platform with 6,000+ Jenkins instances serving around 43,000 builds per day on multi-cluster Kubernetes. A system built with metrics, key resource tuning, remediation’s and security in place. Join this session to hear from eBay on their journey of best practices and learnings about open source.\n\nMachine Learning Plugins for Data Science in Jenkins\n\nDate: Wednesday, September 23, 11:00 a.m.-11:15 a.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Loghi Perinpanayagam\n\nMachine Learning has evolved rapidly in the software industry for recent years. Jenkins CI/CD can be a good practice to deliver a high reliable product in the end. We have done an initial startup on this plugin that can be used to build Jupyter Notebooks, Python files and JSON files in Zeppelin format. In addition, the build wrappers could be used to convert Jupyter Notebooks to Python/JSON and/or copy the files to the workspace for more actions.  This Machine Learning plugin will endeavor to satisfy the data science community together with the help of other plugins. Success of this plugin will definitely serve much benefits to the community and Jenkins.\n\nJenkins UI Gets a Makeover\n\nDate: Thursday, September 24, 7:30 a.m.-8:00 a.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeakers: Felix Queiruga & Jeremy Hartley\n\nAn overview of the Jenkins UI overhaul. We are taking an iterative approach to gradually refresh the Jenkins UI. This approach will make Jenkins look fresh and modern, without changing the way users are accustomed to working with Jenkins or require plugins to be rewritten to render properly in the new Jenkins UI. Join this session to learn the changes we’ve made and how you can help to improve the Jenkins UI.\n\nThe event is free to everyone and recordings will be available on-demand. Registration is required to access the on-demand recordings. And don’t forget to visit the CDF booth in the expo hall for one on one Q&A’s with Jenkins experts.","title":"Jenkins at DevOps World

article describes our observations during Windows testing of the Jenkins 2.249.1 release candidate.\n\nUpgrade testing\n\nJenkins 2.249.1 is a new long term support release with user interface improvements and changes in Windows support.\nIt is the first long term support release to drop support for Microsoft.NET framework 2.0.\nThe end of support for Microsoft.NET framework 2.0 was announced in the Windows Support Updates blog post.\nThe Windows support upgrade guidelines describe major things to consider when upgrading Jenkins controllers and agents on Windows.\n\nAs part of our preparation for the release, we tested several configurations.\nThis article describes our experiences with those configurations.\n\nUpgrade approaches\n\nWe tested controller and agent upgrades from Jenkins 2.235.x to 2.249.1-rc on Windows.\nThe tests included:\n\n32 bit Windows MSI\n\n64 bit Windows MSI\n\nWAR (file) on Windows\n\nUpgrade process\n\nOur upgrade process included:\n\nInstall a previous version of Jenkins controller on Windows\n\nInstall a previous version of Jenkins agent on Windows and configure it as a service\n\nUpgrade Jenkins controller from \"Manage Jenkins\"\n\nRestart the Jenkins Windows service for the controller\n\nUpgrade the Jenkins agent on Windows with the latest agent.jar\n\nRestart the Jenkins Windows service for the agent\n\nTesting results\n\nWe successfully tested\n\nRestarting Windows service for controller ( JENKINS-63198)\n\nRestarting Windows service for agents ( JENKINS-63223)\n\nWe confirmed that we can continue our Level 1 support policy for Jenkins 2.249.1.\n\n32 bit Windows MSI\n\nPrior to Jenkins 2.235.3, the Jenkins LTS Windows installer was provided as a 32 bit MSI and included a bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\nThe Jenkins agent can be downloaded and run through Java web start using the bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\nThe agent can also be configured to run as a service using the bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\n\nJenkins controller\n\nJenkins 2.235.1 installs JRE 8u144 for 32 bit Windows.\nThe installer configures the Jenkins controller to run as the SYSTEM user.\n\nRefer to the Windows Installer Updates blog post for details of the controller installation process with the 32 bit MSI.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent starts the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent\n\nThe downloaded file needs to be opened from a command prompt using the javaws command that is included with the bundled JRE:\n\nC:\\> \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Jenkins\\jre\\bin\\javaws.exe\" -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nThe javaws program has been removed from  the most recent releases of Java 8 and from Java 11.\nRefer to [Jenkins agent and icedtea] for a technique that can help users of the most recent releases of Java 8.\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is adjusted to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nUpgrade the controller\n\nThe Jenkins controller on Windows can be upgraded to Jenkins 2.249.1 from the \"Manage Jenkins\" page.\nThe upgrade process downloads the new jenkins.war file, saves the current version in case of later downgrade, and offers to restart.\n\nUpgrade the agent\n\nThe Jenkins inbound agent is not upgraded automatically.\nThe agent administrator downloads the most recent agent.jar from their Jenkins controller, stops the running agent, and replaces the installed agent.jar with the downloaded version.\nThe agent service will reconnect to the Jenkins controller after the administrator restarts it.\n\n64 bit Windows MSI\n\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.235.3, the Jenkins LTS Windows installer is a 64 bit MSI.\nIt runs Jenkins with the 64 bit JDK (Java 8 or Java 11) selected by the user.\n\nJenkins controller\n\nJenkins 2.235.3 was installed using AdoptOpenJDK Java 8u262 in one test.\nIt was installed using AdoptOpenJDK Java 11.0.8 in another test.\nIn both cases, the installer configured the Jenkins controller to run with the Windows service account we had previously configured.\n\nRefer to the Windows Installer Updates blog post for details of the controller installation process with the 64 bit MSI.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent was started the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent with IcedTea-Web\n\nRecent versions of Java 8 and all versions of Java 11 have removed the javaws command.\nJenkins agents for Java 8 can still be started with the javaws command, but it needs to be downloaded separately from the JVM.\nWe open \"slave-agent.jnlp\" from a command prompt using the javaws command that is available from AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea :\n\nC:\\> C:\\icedtea-web-1.8.3.win.bin\\icedtea-web-image\\bin\\javaws.exe -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is installed and configured to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nUpgrading the controller\n\nThe Jenkins controller on Windows was upgraded to Jenkins 2.249.1 from the \"Manage Jenkins\" page.\nThe upgrade process downloads the new jenkins.war file, saves the current version in case of later downgrade, and offers to restart.\n\nUpgrading the agent\n\nThe Jenkins inbound agent is not upgraded automatically or from a Jenkins user interface.\nThe agent administrator downloads the most recent agent.jar from their Jenkins controller and replaces the installed agent.jar with the downloaded version.\n\nWAR (file) on Windows\n\nJenkins allows users to run the Jenkins web archive (WAR) file from a command line and then install it as a service from within Jenkins.\nThis installation technique uses the Jenkins WAR file but does not use a Windows MSI package.\nThe Jenkins WAR file includes the necessary components to install and configure Jenkins as a service.\n\nInstall controller as a service\n\nWhen the Jenkins war file is started from a Windows command prompt, \"Manage Jenkins\" includes \"Install as a service\".\nAn administrator selects that entry and Jenkins will configure itself to run as a service/\nThe installer configures the Jenkins controller to run as the SYSTEM user.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nAfter opening the Jenkins TCP port for inbound agents, we configured a new agent from the \"Nodes\" menu\nThis created an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent was started the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent with IcedTea-Web\n\nRecent versions of Java 8 and all versions of Java 11 have removed the javaws command.\nJenkins agents for Java 8 can still be started with the javaws command, but it needs to be downloaded separately from the JVM.\nOpen \"slave-agent.jnlp\" from a command prompt using the javaws command that is available from AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea-Web :\n\nC:\\> C:\\icedtea-web-1.8.3.win.bin\\icedtea-web-image\\bin\\javaws.exe -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is installed and configured to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nConclusion\n\nJenkins controller installation is best done with the new 64 bit MSI package.\nPrevious controller installations can be upgraded to the most recent Jenkins release from within Jenkins.\n\nJenkins inbound agent installation is more complicated now that the javaws.exe program is not included in the JDK.\nThe AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea-Web project allows administrators to install and configure Jenkins inbound agents with most of the ease that was available in prior Java releases.","title":"Testing Jenkins 2.249.1 on

One of the reasons it continues to be so ubiquitous is that Jenkins constantly evolves and offers flexibility to integrate other tools that work well for your solution.\n\nAt CDCon, on October 7-8, there are two particular Jenkins talks that will focus on new directions that the Jenkins platform is evolving too and getting better and better for users.\n\nHeard of JCasC and Not Sure Where to Start? Let me Help You!\n\nConfiguration as code is a best practice for your CI/CD setup as it makes the complex process of setting up Jenkins simpler and more reproducible. Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasc) enables Jenkins users to define the whole configuration as a simple, plain text YAML syntax. With JCasc, setting up a new Jenkins controller is easier than ever before. To get started with JCasC some initial effort is required. This talk walks you through a basic setup for easily spinning up new Jenkins instances.\n\nOctober 7 at 2:20 PM PST\nSpeaker: Ewelina Wilkosz, Eficode\n\nEwelina W is passionate about making sure that her customers' software is being built, tested and released in the best possible way. And, most importantly, that software developers don’t hate the process. Ewelina has been involved in Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin development from the very beginning. This is a must-see talk where Ewelina will also share some tips and tricks. The talk will feature using Docker, Jenkins and GitHub Actions as a quick way to build… Jenkins!\n\nBridging the Gap with Tekton-client-plugin for Jenkins\n\nTekton provides Kubernetes-native CI/CD building blocks. It enables users to take full advantage of cloud-native features around scalability and high availability. Jenkins flexibility enables integration with Tekton. This talk showcases the new tekton-client-plugin for Jenkins that enables Jenkins to interact with Tekton pipelines on a Kubernetes cluster. Tekton and Jenkins are both CDF projects and this talk highlights the first steps towards better Tekton and Jenkins interoperability, a key goal of the CD Foundation.\n\nOctober 7 at 11:40 AM PST\nSpeaker: Vibhav Bobade, Red Hat\n\nRegister for CDCon\n\nBoth these talks showcase the ultimate flexibility and power of the Jenkins platform and how it continues to evolve to meet the challenges of modern-day CI/CD. Don’t miss out; register for CDCon to attend.\n\nCDCon has pledged to donate 100% of the proceeds received from CDCon 2020 registration to charitable causes: Black Girls Code, Women Who Code and the CDF Diversity Fund. Registrants indicate which charitable fund they want their 25 USD registration fees to go to during registration. If you can’t afford the registration cost, please apply for the diversity scholarship.","title":"Learn more about Jenkins' continuous evolution at CDCon","tags":["cdcon","talks","jcasc","cicd","tekton"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/4ea1f/cdfoundation.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/b8799/cdfoundation.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/c15a4/cdfoundation.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/4ea1f/cdfoundation.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/d4baf/cdfoundation.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/c9eb6/cdfoundation.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/5f6e9/cdfoundation.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/b881c/cdfoundation.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/3f20b/cdfoundation.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":122}}},"blog":"https://cd.foundation/news/blog/","github":"cdfoundation","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) serves as the vendor-neutral home of many of the fastest-growing projects for continuous delivery, including Jenkins, Jenkins X, Spinnaker, and Tekton.\nCDF supports DevOps practitioners with an open model, training, industry guidelines, and a portability focus.</p>\n</div>","id":"cdfoundation","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Continuous Delivery Foundation","slug":"/blog/authors/cdfoundation","twitter":"cdeliveryfdn"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":"43eb825a-3d18-5e4f-a85a-0f03ad89902f","slug":"/blog/2020/08/31/custom-distribution-service/","strippedHtml":"Hello everyone,\n\nThis is the final blog post for the Custom Distribution Service project during the Google Summer of Code timeline.\nI have mixed feelings since we are almost near the finish line for one of the most amazing open source programs out there.\nHowever, it is time to wrap things up for this project and achieve a state where the project can be built upon and extended further.\nThis phase has been super busy with respect to the bug fixes, testing and getting the project hosted, so let us get straight into the phase 3 updates.\n\nFixes and Code quality assurance\n\nSet Jenkinsfile agent to linux\n\nWe realised that the build was failing on windows and that there was not really a use-case\nfor running it on windows for right now. Maybe it could be on a future roadmap. Therefore, we\ndecided to shift the testing to only linux agents with respect to running the tests on the jenkins\nserver.\n\nPull Request #116\n\nBackend port error message\n\nSpring boot has a default message on the port:8080 and therefore we wanted to change\nit to a custom message on the backend. So the major takeaway here is that we needed to\nimplement the Error Controller interface and include a custom message in it.\nThis was technical debt from the last phase and was completed and merged during this phase.\n\nPull Request #92\n\nPMD Analysis\n\nIn order to enhance the quality of the code, the PMD source code analyser was applied to the project.\nIt helped me catch tons of errors. When the initial PMD check was run and we found approximately 162 PMD errors. We realised some of them were not relevant and some of them could be fixed later.\n\nPull Request #102\n\nFindbugs Analysis\n\nAnother tool to improve code quality that we included in this phase was findbugs.\nIt did catch around 5-10 bugs in my code which I immediately resolved. Most of them were\naround the Closeable HTTP Request and an easy fix was the try with resources.\n\nPull Request #118\n\nJacoco Code Coverage\n\nWe needed to make sure most of the code we write had proper coverage for all branches and\nlines. Therefore we decided to include a JaCoco Code Coverage reporter that helped us find the\nuncovered lines and areas we need to improve coverage on.\n\nPull Request #103\n\nRemove JCasC generation\n\nWhile developing the service we quickly realised that the generation of the war package broke if we\nincluded a configuration as code section but did not provide a path to the corresponding required yml\nfile. Therefore we took a decision to remove the casc section all together. Maybe it will comeback in\na future patch\n\nPull Request link: #127\n\nIssue link: #65\n\nMinor Fixes\n\nLogging Fix: #99\n\nDocs Fix : link: #120\n\nUpdate Center Dump Fix : link: #125\n\nClass Path Fix: link: #126\n\nRelease Drafter Addition: link: #136\n\nFront end\n\nCommunity Config Navigation link\n\nThere was no community configuration link present for navigation which was added here.\n Now it is easier to navigate to the community page from the home page itself.\n\nPull Request #100\n\nDocker updates\n\nBuild everything with Docker\n\nThis was one of the major changes this phase with respect to making the service very easy to spin up locally, this change will greatly help community adoption since it eliminates the tools one needs to install locally. Initially the process was to run maven locally, generate all of the files and then copy all of its contents into the container. However, with this change we are going to generate all of the files inside the docker container itself. Allowing the user to just run a couple of commands to get the service up and running.\n\nSo some of the major changes we did with respect to the dockerfile was:\n\na) Copy all of the configuration files and pom.xml into the container.\n\nb) Run the command mvn clean package inside the container which generates the jar.\n\nc) Run the jar inside the container.\n\nPull Request #104\n\nHosting updates\n\nThis process was supposed to be a future roadmap, however the infra team approved and was super helpful\nin making this process as smooth as possible. Thanks to Gavin, Tim and Oblak for making this possible.\nHere is the google group dicussion\n\nThe project has now been hosted here as a preview. It still needs\nsome fixes to be fully functional.\n\nInfra Docker PR #131\n\nInfra Project Addition PR link: #393\n\nTesting Updates\n\nUnit test the services\n\nWith respect to community hosting and adoption, testing of the service one of the most important and major milestones for this phase was to test the majority of the code and we have completed the testing with flying colors. All of the services have been completely unit tested, which is a major accomplishment.\nFor the testing of the service we decided to go with wiremock which can be used to mock external services. Kezhi’s comment helped us to understand what we needed to do since he had done something quite similar in his Github Checks API project.\n\nSo we basically wiremocked the update-center url and made sure we were getting\nthe accurate response with appropriate control flow logic tested.\n\nwireMockRule.stubFor(get(urlPathMatching(\"/getUpdateCenter\"))\n                .willReturn(aResponse()\n                        .withStatus(200)\n                        .withHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n                        .withBody(updateCenterBody)));\n\nPull Request #105\n\nAdd Update Center controller tests\n\nAnother major testing change involved testing the controllers. For this we decided to use the wiremock library in java to mock the server response when the controllers were invoked.\n\nFor example: If I have a controller that serves in an api called /api/plugin/getPluginList\nwiremock can be used to stub out its response when the system is under test. So we use something like this to test it out.\n\nwhen(updateService.downloadUpdateCenterJSON()).thenReturn(util.convertPayloadToJSON(dummyUpdateBody))\n\nWhen the particular controller is called the underlying service is mocked and it returns a response according to the one provided by us. To find more details the PR is here.\n\nPull Request #106\n\nAdd Packager Controller Tests\n\nAlong with the update center controller tests another controller that needed to be tested was the\npackager controller. Also we needed to make sure that all the branches for the controllers were properly tested. Additional details can be found in the PR below.\n\nPull Request #133\n\nDocker Compose Tests\n\nOne problem that we faced the entire phase was the docker containers. We regularly found out that due to\nsome changes in the codebase the docker container build sometimes broke, or even sometimes the inner api’s seemed to malfunction. In order to counteract that we decided to come up with some tests locally.\nSo what I did was basically introduce a set of bash scripts that would do the following:\n\na) Build the container using the docker-compose command.\n\nb) Run the container.\n\nc) Test the api’s using the exposed port.\n\nd) Teardown the running containers.\n\nPull Request #131\n\nUser Documentation\n\nWe also included a user docs guide so that it makes it super easy to get started with the service.\n\nPull Request #145\n\nFuture Roadmap\n\nThis has been a super exciting project to work on and I can definitely see this project being built\nupon and extended in the future.\n\nI would like to talk about some of the features that are left to come in and can be taken up in\na future roadmap discussion\n\na) JCasC Support :\n\nDescription: Support the generation of a Jenkins Configuration as Code file asking the user interactively for the plugins they select what would be the configuration they would want eg: If the user selects the slack plugin we need to ask him questions like what is the slack channel? what is the token? etc, and on the basis of this generate a casc file. This feature was initially planned to go into the service but we realised this is a project in its own capacity.\n\nb) Auto Pull Request Creation :\n\nDescription: Allow users to create a configuration file and immediately open a pull request on github\nwithout leaving the user interface. This was originally planned using a github bot and we started the work on it. But we were in doubt if the service would be hosted or not and therefore put the development on hold.\nYou can find the pull requests here:\n\nGithub Controller #72\n\nPull Request Creation Functions #66\n\nc) Synergy with Image Controller\n\nDescription: This feature requires some planning, some of the questions we can ask are:\n\na) Can we generate the images (i.e Image Controller).\nb) Can we have the service as a multipurpose generator ?\n\nStatistics\n\nThis phase has been the busiest of all phases and it has involved a lot of work, more than I had\ninitially expected in the phase. Although lines\nof code added is not an indication of work done, however 800 lines of Code added is a real personal milestone for me.\n\nPull Requests Opened\n26\n\nLines of Code Added\n1096\n\nLines of Docs Added\n200\n\nOther links\n\nGitter Channel Link\nGSoC Proposal\nDesign Document\nDaily Notes","title":"Custom Distribution Service : Phase 3 Blogpost","tags":["service","distribution","cloud-native","gsoc","gsoc2020","packaging","platform-sig"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"sladyn98","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sladyn is a Computer Science student at Mumbai University, India.\nHe is participating in Community Bridge 2019 to provide development tools to JCasC plugin in the form of IDE integrations, schema architecture improvements and configuration extension points <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin\">Configuration as Code Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"sladyn98","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sladyn Nunes","slug":"/blog/authors/sladyn98","twitter":"SladynN"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":"6bac69c5-68d0-5291-8064-51a2296a084b","slug":"/blog/2020/08/31/github-checks-api-plugin-coding-phase-3/","strippedHtml":"This blog post is about our phase 3 progress on GitHub Checks API Project, you can find our previous blog posts for phase 1 and phase 2.\n\nAt the end of this summer, the GSoC journey for GitHub Checks API Project comes to an end as well.\nIn this blog post, I’ll show you our works during the last month:\n\nPipeline Support\n\nRerun Request Support\n\nGit SCM Support\n\nDocumentation\n\nAll the above features will be available in our planned 1.0.0 version of Checks API Plugin and GitHub Checks Plugin.\n\nCoding Phase 3 Demo\n\nPipeline Support\n\nThe pipeline support allows users to directly publish checks in their pipeline script without depending on any other consumers.\n\nThe check in the above screenshot is published by script:\n\npublishChecks name: 'pipeline check', title: 'pipeline ', summary: '# A pipeline check example',\n        text: \"## This check is published through the pipeline script\",\n        detailsURL: 'https://ci.jenkins.io'\n\nIf you want to publish checks to GitHub, please install the GitHub implementation and refer to the GitHub API documentation for the requirements for each field. A default value (build link) for detailsURL will be provided automatically.\n\nThis feature can be useful when many stages exist in your pipeline script and each takes a long time: you can publish a check for each stage to keep track of the build.\n\nRerun Request Support\n\nThe rerun request allows GitHub users to rerun the failed builds. When a build failed (which leads to a failed check), a Re-run button will be added automatically by GitHub.\n\nBy clicking the Re-run button, Jenkins will reschedule a build for the last commit of this branch.\n\nSince all checks of a commit are produced by a single build, you don’t have to rerun all failed checks, just rerun any one of the failed check will refresh all checks.\n\nGit SCM Support\n\nThanks to Ullrich 's great help, the GitHub Checks Plugin now supports Git SCM.\nThis means now you can publish checks for your freestyle project or any other projects that use Git SCM.\n\nDocument\n\nConsumers Guide and Implementation Guide are now available.\nAs a Jenkins developer, you can now start consuming our API or even providing an implementation for other SCM platforms beside GitHub.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThe whole GitHub Checks API project is started as a Google Summer of Code project. Much appreciate my mentors ( Tim and Ullrich) for their great help during the whole summer. Also huge thanks to the Jenkins GSoC SIG and the whole community for the technique support and resources.\n\nResources\n\nChecks API Plugin\n\nGitHub Checks Plugin\n\nProject Page\n\nGitter Channel","title":"GitHub Checks API Plugin Project - Coding Phase 3","tags":["github","api","plugins","developer","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/19e71/XiongKezhi.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/77b35/XiongKezhi.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/d4a57/XiongKezhi.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/19e71/XiongKezhi.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/68974/XiongKezhi.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/ef6ff/XiongKezhi.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/8257c/XiongKezhi.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/6766a/XiongKezhi.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/22bfc/XiongKezhi.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"XiongKezhi","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2020 Student.
