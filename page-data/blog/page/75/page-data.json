Who is it for? What are the highlights of your plugin?* +\n +\n\n+\nA: https://loader.io[Loader.io] is a simple-to-use cloud-based load testing service. The service is designed for developers and people who need to ensure applications are performing as they should. It allows developers to perform large-scale load tests on demand, which lets them understand the scalability and performance of their applications. We realize Jenkins is the preferred build service for a lot of our users, and we know providing a way for them to implement, measure and improve application performance during the continuous build cycle is important. So we wrote a Jenkins plugin that allows load testing to be brought into the continuous build and deployment process with ease. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: Did you have to convince your boss/lawyers to open-source your plugin? What was the pitch?*\n\n+\nA: No, at SendGrid our focus is always to help make developers’ lives easier, and when we can, we like to provide tools that they can hack on. Since the Jenkins platform is itself an open source project, following the same model to provide our plugin made perfect sense. In addition, we encourage others to build on our work, help improve it and ultimately make it better for everyone using it. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: How did you learn how to write a plugin?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: We use the Jenkins platform ourselves, and we leverage a number of the plugins available. Having access to these and the Jenkins documentation gave us a great head start. It was an easy decision to write the Jenkins plugin for loader.io, and the Jenkins community provided both detailed instructions as well as support when we needed it. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: Any gotchas in the experience of developing a plugin that you want to share?\n\n*\n\n+\nA: The overall process of developing the plugin was straightforward and simple, but we did run into some scope creep in the middle of the dev process. We found that since the platform was so easy to write for, it made us keep adding more and more features. Usually this is good, but in the case of our project, we wanted to provide the most value as quickly as possible. So we scaled back, focused on solid execution for the most important features, and are already preparing to launch a new version with the things we reserved for post v1 availability. +\n +\n +\n\n+\nQ: What is the reaction from users so far?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: The users we’ve spoken with love the plugin. In addition we’ve already gotten great feedback from some community members on “nice to have’s” in the plugin, some of which we’re already working on. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: What tips do you share to those who are interested in writing plugins?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: If you have a service that provides value in the build, deployment and post deployment process, then you should be writing a Jenkins plugin. Two things are important for anyone writing a plugin: 1) be sure the plugin you’re writing is going to provide true value (if you need it yourself this is a good sign), and 2) make sure you understand the scope of the project and deliver core features and value first, then focus on some extra things. Providing a valuable plugin sooner than later will help you identify all the right additional features to include, especially when collecting live community feedback. +\n +\n\n+\nSome of the things we focused on early in the process were to identify the core features, and more importantly to make it very easy for users of Jenkins to install, use and interpret the loader.io plugin and results. We wanted to allow users to leverage our plugin for multiple environments and builds with system and global credentials. To do this, we decided to make use of the Credentials plugin (https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin), which is a heavily-adopted plugin that provides a standardized API for plugins to store and retrieve credentials. This plugin allows our users to add and use different credentials in one single Jenkins environment. In addition, we created a new re-run feature which, when used with continuous build and testing, provides a deep view into the performance of an application over time. Finally, we wanted to bring the same UI experience users have in our environment into Jenkins, which we did by preserving the load test report model and making it function the same in the Jenkins UI. Doing this makes it easy for users to have consistency between the UIs and more easily understand the results regardless of where they’re viewing them. +\n +\n\n+\nIt’s very easy to write a Jenkins plugin - I hope these insights will encourage you to write your own. +\n +\n\n+\nps - We’d love your feedback too.

At customer after customer we've seen extreme feedback devices drive significant incremental productivity gains, so about a year ago we started talking about taking the concept mainstream and making it easily available to any development team. So, as a small side-project, we've decided to scratch our own itch and developed an easy-to-deploy, Linux-based, laser-cut, extreme feedback device, specifically designed for Jenkins.

This is a pretty awesome library, I think, which served us well. +\n +\n\n+\nOne of the things this remoting layer does it to transfer the Java byte code on demand from the controller to agents on demand. This approach helps us keep agent deployment simple, as you don't have to keep the controller and all the agents in sync, but it also made the agent start-up slower, because none of the byte code loaded to agents are kept around. It was all forgotten once the agent gets disconnected. +\n +\n\n+\nWhen agents are static and stays online for hours, this wasn't a problem at all. But as more and more agents become elastic (think EC2 or CloudBees DEV@cloud), This delay is becoming more and more noticeable. A similar issue happens when the Maven project type, which uses the same remoting library to talk to the running Maven build. +\n +\n\n+\nAnother related performance bottleneck is the round-trip latency. When your agent is far away from a controller, every classloading would incur a network round-trip, and it can add up quickly. This is because Java classloading abstraction is funamentally chatty. +\n +\n\n+\nJesse and I https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-15120[started seriously thinking about this problem] last year, and we've https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/pull/10[kept a branch going] to address this problem. +\n +\n\n+\nAfter several trans-atlantic hacking during flights, we were finally able to release this in 1.519. +\n +\n\n+\nStarting this version, the remoting layer uses a local jar file cache to store jar files that were downloaded from the controller. This pretty much eliminated the need to send class files over the wire. +\n +\n\n+\nIn addition, the controller will analyze class files as a agent request them and \"push down\" information about how related other classes should be loaded by the agent. This speculative \"prefetching\" saves the agent from making an expensive network round trip to the controller. +\n +\n\n+\nIn https://jenkins-ci.361315.n4.nabble.com/Efficient-class-jar-prefetching-in-remoting-td4665943.html[my benchmark using Maven builds, the prefetching cut the # of roundtrips to about half]. +\n +\n\n+\nIf you do a lot of Maven builds, or if you have elastic agents, we highly encourage you to upgrade. +\n +\n +\n +\n +","title":"Faster agent classloading","tags":["development","core"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"4e7a1585-88fc-5af9-bed4-a44535c9067f","slug":"/blog/2013/07/24/jenkins-user-event-in-copenhagen-on-september-6/","strippedHtml":"Seize the opportunity to join the Jenkins community!\n\nJust like last year, the Scandinavian Jenkins Conference will be in Copenhagen, Denmark, hosted by Praqma and sponsored by CloudBees, Sony, Switch::Gears, and PRQA.
