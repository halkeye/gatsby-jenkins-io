This is a pretty awesome library, I think, which served us well. +\n +\n\n+\nOne of the things this remoting layer does it to transfer the Java byte code on demand from the controller to agents on demand. This approach helps us keep agent deployment simple, as you don't have to keep the controller and all the agents in sync, but it also made the agent start-up slower, because none of the byte code loaded to agents are kept around. It was all forgotten once the agent gets disconnected. +\n +\n\n+\nWhen agents are static and stays online for hours, this wasn't a problem at all. But as more and more agents become elastic (think EC2 or CloudBees DEV@cloud), This delay is becoming more and more noticeable. A similar issue happens when the Maven project type, which uses the same remoting library to talk to the running Maven build. +\n +\n\n+\nAnother related performance bottleneck is the round-trip latency. When your agent is far away from a controller, every classloading would incur a network round-trip, and it can add up quickly. This is because Java classloading abstraction is funamentally chatty. +\n +\n\n+\nJesse and I https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-15120[started seriously thinking about this problem] last year, and we've https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/pull/10[kept a branch going] to address this problem. +\n +\n\n+\nAfter several trans-atlantic hacking during flights, we were finally able to release this in 1.519. +\n +\n\n+\nStarting this version, the remoting layer uses a local jar file cache to store jar files that were downloaded from the controller. This pretty much eliminated the need to send class files over the wire. +\n +\n\n+\nIn addition, the controller will analyze class files as a agent request them and \"push down\" information about how related other classes should be loaded by the agent. This speculative \"prefetching\" saves the agent from making an expensive network round trip to the controller. +\n +\n\n+\nIn https://jenkins-ci.361315.n4.nabble.com/Efficient-class-jar-prefetching-in-remoting-td4665943.html[my benchmark using Maven builds, the prefetching cut the # of roundtrips to about half]. +\n +\n\n+\nIf you do a lot of Maven builds, or if you have elastic agents, we highly encourage you to upgrade. +\n +\n +\n +\n +","title":"Faster agent classloading","tags":["development","core"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"4e7a1585-88fc-5af9-bed4-a44535c9067f","slug":"/blog/2013/07/24/jenkins-user-event-in-copenhagen-on-september-6/","strippedHtml":"Seize the opportunity to join the Jenkins community!\n\nJust like last year, the Scandinavian Jenkins Conference will be in Copenhagen, Denmark, hosted by Praqma and sponsored by CloudBees, Sony, Switch::Gears, and PRQA.

I believe Shlomi Ben-Haim of JFrog said in his opening speech that the attendance has grown more than 50%, despite the ticket price increase. +\n +\n\n+\nThis year, the event was held at a former Kibbutz turned into an event facility. This was rather fit for Jenkins for both emphasizes the community. The auditorium was big, the sky was bright & clear, and it was a wonderful day. JFrog folks even made a few Jenkins drapes (that I eventually brought back with me, so expect to see them) +\n +\n\n+ +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nFor me, talks like one from Haggai are more interesting, as it shows me how Jenkins works in a domain that I’m not familiar with (in this case, .NET). And if you are Jenkins users, there are all sorts of talks, ranging from talks on CLI/XML interface of Jenkins (stuff for those who are writing tools and scripts that interface with Jenkins) to how someone managed user interface automation testing with Jenkins. Another talk that I got hooked was a talk from https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-israel-abstracts.cb#YardenaMeymann[Yardena Meymann] about the review board Jenkins plugin that she wrote that lets you test out code change under the review, much the same way https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/[BuildHive] or https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Github+pull+request+builder+plugin[GitHub pull request builder plugin] does it for GitHub pull requests, but for Subversion.

They cornered me on multiple occasions and we had a lot of interesting conversations, so much so that I missed about half the talks!

Combine that with the fact that there are so many different ways to use Git, it was inevitable that Git plugin became quite a capable but complex plugin over time. It has more than a dozen options and switches, and it was becoming harder to use and harder to maintain.\n\nAs early as 2010, some of us have already been saying that we should refactor this plugin, but none of us have managed. The good news is, I finally started tackling this problem last month while I was in London, and I’ve made a steadily progress since then and I’m ready for a wider review.\n\nSo we’ll spend this Wednesday going over the changes. I’ll show you how the new version looks, what changes are made internally, and what it’ll enable us in the future.\n\nIf the Git plugin is important to you, and you want to see what’s cooking, please join us in the office hours on Google Hangout.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you!","title":"Office hours this week: Git plugin refactoring","tags":["development","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"24926dd2-b6f9-5057-9f68-59a583212c04","slug":"/blog/2013/06/21/reducing-the-of-threads-in-jenkins-ssh-slaves/","strippedHtml":"+\nAs the usage of Jenkins expands, we started seeing users who run multiple 100s of agents on one controller, and thus it became a lot more important for us to scale well to even larger number of agents. +\n +\n\n+\nWhile I was looking at the thread dump of a large system, I started noticing that there are a large number of threads lying around pumping `+InputStream+` and writing to another `+OutputStream+`. On Linux, each thread occupies 2MB just for its stack size, so if we can eliminate some of them, it'd be a good saving. +\n +\n\n+\nSo this morning, I tackled one source of such waste. +\n +\n\n+\nJenkins has https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin[the ability to launch agent on a remote server via SSH] for the longest time, and to simplify this, we've been using a https://github.com/jenkinsci/trilead-ssh2[pure-Java implementation of SSH client]. +\n +\n\n+\nTo cut the long story short, I was able to eliminate two pump threads per every SSH connection. Furthermore, when it runs on the upcoming Jenkins 1.521, it'll save one more thread per every SSH connection. So if you have 100 agents connected through SSH, this alone saves up 600MB of memory. That's pretty good for a few hours work! +\n +\n\n+\nIf you run a lot of agents, be sure to pick up version 0.27 of https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin[the SSH agents plugin] to take advantages of this! +","title":"Reducing the # of threads in Jenkins: SSH agents","tags":["development","news","plugins","releases"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","id":"705feeb0-19df-50df-9707-c5368ab86dcb","slug":"/blog/2013/05/22/jenkins-user-conference-israel-coming-june-6/","strippedHtml":"Your favorite Butler will visit Israel on June 6 for the Jenkins User Conference Israel.
