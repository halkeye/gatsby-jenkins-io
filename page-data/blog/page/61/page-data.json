Our goal is to enable more members of the community to meet each other and exchange ideas in person.\n\nWe’re still hashing out the details, but it’ll be available to every Jenkins community member. Apply, telling us what Jenkins-related event you’d like to attend and how awesome you are, and we may support your travel with up to 500 USD. For details on how this will work, see the current draft of the travel grant program.\n\nThe first person to be supported in this way is Pradeepto Bhattacharya from Pune, India. He was a speaker at this year’s JUC Europe in London, and will give two talks at JUC US West next week—​and we help him get there! He asked us a few weeks back whether the Jenkins project could support his trip to the US. We came to the conclusion that this would be a good idea—​so good in fact, that we decided to build a regular program from it.\n\nAre you planning to attend a JUC or similar event, but worry about the cost of travel?

I had not pictured enterprise release managers as plugin developers. Here at Black Duck Software, we developed Jenkins plugins for four years running. Fabrice Solami, a sales engineer, wanted to do more than automate our code scanning tool via a shell script step in the Jenkins job. He wrote a first plugin that added a build step to run the tool and configure the job more comfortably. The plugin became quickly popular, and when customers asked for it to also support maven builds and run on agents, it was time for help from the engineering team, particularly the integration team I lead.\n\n+\n+\n\nOver the years we developed four more plugins and overhauled the original one with the user community (aka paying customers) growing to >75 organizations, mostly large or really large development organizations. In the process, we received lots of feedback and discovered some Jenkins features we feel are essential for good plugin design for the enterprise. Let me share these insights so that you can consider them in your plugin development.\n\n+\n+\n\nCredentials Plugin\n\n+\n+\n\nOur plugins connect to our web applications and need authentication to utilize our SDK. The first plugins used username and password fields in every job configuration. That made tedious configuration work and stores the passwords in clear text in the configuration files on disk. Ouch!\n\n+\n+\n\nWe did wise up and started using the credentials plugin to manage username/passwords centrally and securely. It even allows setting authorization roles in such a way that the maintainer of a job can use the credentials without seeing the password. With that in place, our plugins are fit for banks and insurance companies and any other security-conscious organization.\n\n+\n+\n\nSupport the REST API\n\n+\n+\n\nDid you know that Jenkins talks REST? We found it to be an easy way to create and update jobs. It is a really handy tool. The REST API is easy to script for all sorts of external interactions.\n\n+\n+\n\nHowever, plugins need to do a little effort to support it on their part; yet it is almost trivial to do. So from our experience it should not be left out.\n\n+\n+\n\nWe wrote a small Java program that reads, creates, updates job configurations, and can trigger job runs. It reads the jobs and commits them to a file for easy mass editing and updates the jobs afterwards.\n\n+\n+\n\nOur internal use case is to manage regression tests. We have medium-sized lists of jobs that run regression tests. With this tooling we can create a new set of jobs for a given plugin that runs against a new target server, that is, a server version under QA. It all happens in less than 15 minutes.\n\n+\n+\n\nWe also made this part of our migration from our first plugin to its successor with all the enterprise capabilities, but incompatible configuration. Using the REST API and some more Java programs we can create a csv file / Excel spreadsheet with jobs that are configured with the previous plugin. The user can filter the list with the spreadsheet application as needed, and then use the resulting list as input to the batch upgrade tool. This makes the upgrade a gradual affair and not a tedious exercise in UI configuration changes.\n\n+\n+\n\nUpdateSites Manager Plugin\n\n+\n+\n\nIf you are developing plugins for in-house use, you have the option to install/update those through file upload. However, in an enterprise you likely have multiple Jenkins servers for different divisions, development groups, or regions. The notification of updates becomes tedious at best. Wouldn’t it be nice to run your own update site, so that your plugin(s) become discoverable in the “Available” tab of the “Manage plugins” screen? Wouldn’t it be a dream if available new versions show up automatically in the “Updates” tab, including Jenkins version compatibility check?\n\n+\n+\n\nUpdateSites Manager plugin by IKEDA Yasuyuki is the answer to your prayers. It is easy to install, and the process to create and publish an update site is not too complicated and can become part of your Jenkins job building/releasing the plugin.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn my presentation at JUC 2015 West, I’ll share more details on how this makes a difference and how you can use these techniques to make your plugins enterprise-grade. As a bonus, I’ll show you how to get a free vulnerability report for your Maven or Gradle builds.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/Kandler_0.jpg[image,width=152,height=182] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Kaj Kandler, Integration Manager atBlack Duck Software, Inc.

For the first time, there’s a mobile track at this year’s Jenkins User Conference to discuss the best ways to extend CI/CD to mobile application testing.\n\n+\n+\n\nAs agile practices take hold, enterprises are expecting more collaboration between dev and test teams. Dev teams are doing more testing while QA teams are becoming more skilled at coding. This is happening now, and as a result open-source test automation frameworks like Selenium and Appium are flourishing. At the same time, CI/CD adoption is growing. This is happening more so for web development rather than mobile. It’s no secret that incorporating mobile test automation and CI comes with challenges. Mobile UI testing on real devices is still a manual process for many organizations. Manual testing is perhaps a path of least resistance, but it also commits teams to the longest delivery path. Some argue they lack the environment, resources or skilled people to create test automation. While the argument rages, its clear other teams are solving the challenge. Teams are prioritizing the requirement to build a test framework and aligning disparate tools into an effective CI workflow. Recent webinars with Paychex and RaboBank demonstrate CI/CD best practices can effectively extend to mobile app programs using real devices. Particularly when the lab is moved to the cloud and teams can focus on building robust test automation suites.\n\n+\n+\n\nBut overall, the transition to an agile SDLC for mobile apps is happening too slowly. Yet the mobile market demands constant updates. An essential part of an agile SDLC is utilizing automated testing and continuous integration. To test builds using a CI server requires automation which is key to agile development in a fast-paced mobile world because it allows testing to be done by developers early in the lifecycle.\n\n+\n+\n\nExtending CI to mobile programs is easy with Perfecto Mobile’s support for open source frameworks such as Selenium Remote Web Driver, Appium and Calabash where existing CI plugins are available. Support for commercial tools like HP UFT is also available. With the Perfecto Mobile Jenkins Plugin, you can perform automated functional testing every build. The result is obvious, discover defects earlier, deliver faster feedback and increase release frequency and, ultimately, have better performing apps.\n\n+\n+\n\nLearn more about extending your CI practice to mobile projects in our upcoming JUC mobile session: “Fast Feedback: Jenkins and Functional Mobile App Testing Without Pulling Your Hair Out.” The session will share suggested coding practices along with planning guidance on maximizing the quality coverage during daily, nightly and weekly builds.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe Jenkins User Conference US West takes place in Santa Clara, CA on Sep 2-3, 2015.\n\n+\n+\n\nStop by the Perfecto Mobile booth and share your story.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/cadet_0.jpg[image,width=152,height=182] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Carlo Cadet, Director of Product Marketing at Perfecto Mobile.
