I’ll be there for JUC West on September 2-3 with the XebiaLabs team, and am looking forward to talking to the Jenkins users, partners, developers and community members that will be coming together.\n\n+\n+\n\nAt JUC East, I talked about the importance of Automated Testing in your Continuous Delivery pipeline, and I was really pleased by the number of interesting discussions and comments that came about as a result.\n\n+\n+\n\nFor JUC West, I’ll be taking a broader view, and will talk about building an \"Enterprise Continuous Delivery Machine\" around Jenkins. I’m going to focus on the challenge of identifying and choosing solutions for the many \"adjacent problem spaces\" to Continuous Integration that you run into when trying to move to Continuous Delivery: artifact management, feature tracking, environment provisioning, deployment automation, test management, pipeline orchestration, production feedback and more.\n\n+\n+\n\nWe’ll discuss some of the options available for each category, with a special focus on app deployment, test result management and pipeline orchestration. We’ll also present a couple of real-world Continuous Delivery Machine architectures, and analyze some of the motivations for each organization’s choices.\n\n+\n+\n\nMost of our users use XebiaLabs tools/products in combination with Jenkins to build out their Continuous Delivery stack. If you’re scaling out your Jenkins usage too, stop by the XebiaLabs booth to see if you can pick up some tips and to say hello.\n\n+\n+\n\nLook forward to seeing you at the event, or check the slides or recording we will post after the event.

We lost none of the data, after all.\n\nOSUOSL have since published their post mortem. I was really wrong about not losing any data:\n\nA further complication was that our backups were pointed at mysql2, which was out-of-date with mysql1, due to the initial synchronization failures. Fortunately, we had the binary logs from the 17th through the 30th. This means that though most data could be restored, some data from between the 15th and the 17th was lost.\n\nFor our issue tracker, that means that issues JENKINS-29432 to JENKINS-29468 were lost, as well as comments posted from about July 15 12:20 PM to July 17 2 AM (UTC).

For the first time, there’s a mobile track at this year’s Jenkins User Conference to discuss the best ways to extend CI/CD to mobile application testing.\n\n+\n+\n\nAs agile practices take hold, enterprises are expecting more collaboration between dev and test teams. Dev teams are doing more testing while QA teams are becoming more skilled at coding. This is happening now, and as a result open-source test automation frameworks like Selenium and Appium are flourishing. At the same time, CI/CD adoption is growing. This is happening more so for web development rather than mobile. It’s no secret that incorporating mobile test automation and CI comes with challenges. Mobile UI testing on real devices is still a manual process for many organizations. Manual testing is perhaps a path of least resistance, but it also commits teams to the longest delivery path. Some argue they lack the environment, resources or skilled people to create test automation. While the argument rages, its clear other teams are solving the challenge. Teams are prioritizing the requirement to build a test framework and aligning disparate tools into an effective CI workflow. Recent webinars with Paychex and RaboBank demonstrate CI/CD best practices can effectively extend to mobile app programs using real devices. Particularly when the lab is moved to the cloud and teams can focus on building robust test automation suites.\n\n+\n+\n\nBut overall, the transition to an agile SDLC for mobile apps is happening too slowly. Yet the mobile market demands constant updates. An essential part of an agile SDLC is utilizing automated testing and continuous integration. To test builds using a CI server requires automation which is key to agile development in a fast-paced mobile world because it allows testing to be done by developers early in the lifecycle.\n\n+\n+\n\nExtending CI to mobile programs is easy with Perfecto Mobile’s support for open source frameworks such as Selenium Remote Web Driver, Appium and Calabash where existing CI plugins are available. Support for commercial tools like HP UFT is also available. With the Perfecto Mobile Jenkins Plugin, you can perform automated functional testing every build. The result is obvious, discover defects earlier, deliver faster feedback and increase release frequency and, ultimately, have better performing apps.\n\n+\n+\n\nLearn more about extending your CI practice to mobile projects in our upcoming JUC mobile session: “Fast Feedback: Jenkins and Functional Mobile App Testing Without Pulling Your Hair Out.” The session will share suggested coding practices along with planning guidance on maximizing the quality coverage during daily, nightly and weekly builds.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe Jenkins User Conference US West takes place in Santa Clara, CA on Sep 2-3, 2015.\n\n+\n+\n\nStop by the Perfecto Mobile booth and share your story.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/cadet_0.jpg[image,width=152,height=182] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Carlo Cadet, Director of Product Marketing at Perfecto Mobile.
