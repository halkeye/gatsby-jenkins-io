We do not longer use the IRC chat for that purpose.\n\n#jenkins-cert - no private chat going forward. The Security Team will use mailing lists only going forward\n\n#jenkins-community - Replaced by the Advocacy&Outreach Gitter channel.\n\nFreenode concerns and disclaimers\n\nGoing forward, the Jenkins community does not have ANY official channels on Freenode.\nAll channels are either removed or left abandoned.\nWe no longer manage or control our channels.\nMost of the Jenkins IRC channel operators use IRCCloud,\nand hence they were banned by the Freenode team on June 11th.\nOnly a few operators have reconnected since this event.\n\nTaking the takeover of Freenode and hostile actions taken by the new management,\nwe can no longer guarantee any of the following:\n\nAuthenticity of registered users on Freenode.\nAll IRC accounts, cloaked or not, might have been taken over by the new Freenode management.\n Do not trust messages from the Jenkins contributor account IDs there.\n\nConfidentiality of private channels like #jenkins-cert.\nWe performed audit of the conversations there, and we believe there are no undisclosed security vulnerabilities referenced in the channel.\n After all, this IRC has been rather dormant for the last 18 months.\n\nIRC User Passwords.\nAll passwords on Freenode IRC may be compromised in the future.\nWe strongly advise all users to rotate their passwords if they were used on Freenode IRC.\n\nWe have made backups of IRC channel conversations in the abandoned channels.\nIf you need to access the conversation history, please reach out to the Jenkins Infrastructure team.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the entire Libera Chat team and all contributors who have worked on creating\na Freenode replacement for hundreds of open source communities using IRC.\nWithin just a month, a new platform has been created and adopted by almost all active projects.\nWe remember the Hudson to Jenkins renaming days when a similar mobilization happened in the Jenkins community,\nand we appreciate all the effort put by contributors.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels\nand our automation like the IRC Bot used by the Jenkins hosting team.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn the Jenkins community we will keep using Libera Chat IRC and maintaining user and contributor channels there.\nOther Jenkins chat channels like Gitter and Slack are unchanged.\nWe intend to gradually replace many of those channels with community.jenkins.io.\nThis is a new portal powered by Discourse.\nThe service is sponsored by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc..\nIt is currently in preview, stay tuned for announcements.\nAs always, we will appreciate any suggestions and [feedback]( https://community.jenkins.io/c/site-feedback/2)!","title":"Jenkins IRC moves to Libera Chat","tags":["community","announcement","chat"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"markewaite","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Mark is the <a href=\"/project/team-leads/#documentation\">Jenkins Documentation Officer</a>, a long-time Jenkins user and contributor, and maintains the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/git\">git plugin</a> and the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client\">git client plugin</a>.\nHe is active in <a href=\"/sigs/\">Jenkins special interest groups</a> including the <a href=\"/sigs/docs/\">Docs SIG</a>, <a href=\"/sigs/platform\">Platform SIG</a>, and <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach\">Advocacy SIG</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"markewaite","irc":"markewaite","linkedin":"markwaite","name":"Mark Waite","slug":"/blog/author/markewaite","twitter":"MarkEWaite"},{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/author/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2021-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","id":"4c6e6edc-73d1-5cc5-a069-c6c11dc61c74","slug":"/blog/2021/06/10/jenkins-is-the-way-ebook-2/","strippedHtml":"A little over a year ago, we launched JenkinsIsTheWay.io, a website whose sole purpose is to share Jenkins user stories with the developers and engineers in our community.  Over a hundred of you have already shared your innovations, and they just keep coming.  It comes as no surprise that many of the submitted stories are from IT consultants and software developers around the world building next-generation DevOps and CI/CD platforms to fuel the modernization of enterprise companies far and wide.\n\nThat’s why we’ve dedicated our latest eBook to focus on Jenkins users in the global Information Technology sector.  We shine the spotlight on these developers and engineers who have solved unique software development and DevOps challenges by turning to the leading open source automation server.  From powering large enterprises needing a better way to manage their inventory to innovative tech firms looking to advance technologies and healthcare initiatives during a pandemic, you’ll read about how teams everywhere solved their unique challenges — with the help of Jenkins.\n\nJenkins is the Way to…\n\nIn our short User Story Survey, we ask Jenkins users to fill in the blank: Jenkins is the way to …​…​\n\nWe’ve seen results-oriented submissions like \"Jenkins is the way to deliver our new releases on time!\" and \"Jenkins is the way to understand and simplify your software workflows.\"  Several submissions riffed off of something like \"Jenkins is the way to completely automate your CI/CD workflow.\"  Meanwhile, others have had a bit more fun and languished praise on Jenkins, stating, \"Jenkins is the way to help teams focus on what is really important, make our life easier\" and, even, \"Jenkins is the way to save the day.\"\n\nIn this new eBook, we focus on the challenges users in the community face, and what they’ve built using Jenkins to achieve their unique goals. For example, Build & Release Manager, Donald Morton, turned to Jenkins to establish a flexible, modern, and more efficient DevOps platform for Graylog, a leading log management platform serving the enterprise.\n\nWith a Jenkins assist, Mark Baumann, DevOps Engineer with ITK Engineering, created “ one CI to rule them all.” He told us that “Jenkins provides a common CI/CD platform for all different kinds of projects and technology domains.”\n\nWhen IBM Lead Software Engineer Alec Rieger sought to simplify the build and testing pipeline for the company’s software engineers and developers, he also turned to Jenkins.  For a company the size of IBM, which services enterprise clients worldwide, Rieger wanted to help his colleagues manage many nodes on a large scale. Now, according to his Jenkins Is The Way user story, IBM uses Jenkins pipelines for each of their builds and relies on the flexibility and countless plugin features to continually improve their processes.\n\nStronger, Smarter, Faster Software Innovation\n\nWhile we all fondly think of Jenkins as a modest butler who has empowered developers with the open-source tools they need to succeed — on JenkinsIsTheWay.io, we liken him to an unpretentious, yet powerful superhero.  And like any great superhero, he (or she!) is sure to save the day.\n\nFor our Jenkins users, that means results — significant, measurable results with a common theme.  Using Jenkins has enabled you — the user — to help the businesses you serve save money, spin up software faster, and automate processes.  In doing so, you’ve freed up developers and engineers from countless hours of mundane tasks.  Thanks to Jenkins, you’re empowering entire IT teams to innovate, focus on what they love to do and, ultimately, build great stuff.\n\nOf course, we devote much of our latest eBook to those victories.  Results like how RedHat’s releases are 5x faster thanks to Jenkins.  The fact that DevOps problem tickets were reduced by over 90% for Electronic Health Solutions.  And why the CTO at Cloudologia was psyched to share that — with a Jenkins at the helm — they were able to shorten onboarding for deployment & build release cycles from one week to a single day.\n\nShare Your User Story, Too!\n\nI am proud to share another common theme from the users who have submitted their story:  you turn to our community for collaboration, guidance, and advice.  A community of a million strong and growing, this eBook and JenkinsIsTheWay.io are other ways to provide you with the insight and lessons learned by developers and engineers, like you, to innovate and build next-generation technologies for companies of all sizes.\n\nWhen you’re ready to tell your story, we’re prepared to help you share it. Fill out our short questionnaire, and we’ll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt as a thank you once it’s published!\n\nLinks\n\nJenkins IsThe Way.

Updating the jenkins.yaml file\n\nReload the existing configuration to apply the system message change\n\nNow, go back to the Dashboard and you can see the updated System Message on top:\n\nFigure 2. Viewing the changes on Dashboard\n\nThis file will be used later to configure the plugin using JCasC.\n\nConfigure the plugin on the UI\n\nFor this demo, install the View Job Filters plugin.\n\nLet’s create a view by clicking on the New View option on the left side of the Dashboard.\n\nGive it a name (say, “testView”) and set its type to List View, and click on the OK button.\n\nFigure 3. Creating the View\n\nNow click on Add Job Filter to add any kind of filter, so let’s select Build Duration Filter and fill the field with any value (say, \"60\" minutes),\n\nFigure 4. Adding filter to the view\n\nClick on Apply Save.\n\nTo view the full configuration, check out your main jenkins.yaml configuration file, by clicking on Manage Jenkins Configuration as Code View Configuration\n\nGo to the views section in this YAML file to see details related to the view,\n\nFigure 5. Here, details regarding the view (which we just created) is visible\n\nDownload the Configuration\n\nNow that you have successfully configured your plugin by UI, let’s download the configuration by going to Manage Jenkins on the Dashboard, then click on Configuration as Code under \"System Configuration\".\n\nNow click on the Download Configuration button to save the configuration file locally.\n\nFigure 6. Downloading the Configuration\n\nUpdate JCasC file locally\n\nAdd some changes in your downloaded copy of the jenkins.yaml file, to see those changes being automatically reflected on the UI.\n\nFor demo purposes, let’s change the name to “YoutubeDemoView” and set the buildDurationMinutes as \"55\".\n\nFigure 7. Changing the View details locally\n\nSave the file.\n\nLoad the jenkins.yaml file on the Jenkins server\n\nNow to reflect the local changes done in the jenkins.yaml file onto the Jenkins server, click on the Reload existing configuration button.\n\nFigure 8. Applying the New Configuration to the Jenkins instance\n\nVerify the changes on the UI\n\nGo back to the main page by clicking on the Jenkins logo on the top-left side.\n\nAnd you will notice that the name of your view has been changed from \"testView\" to “YoutubeDemoView”,\n\nAnd the field value of Build Duration Filter has been changed from \"60\" to “55”.\n\nThese two are the exact changes that we did locally in our jenkins.yaml file.\n\nFigure 9.

A bad pipeline cannot take down another one & the kubernetes scheduler manages them all\n\neach step can be any command in any container image with whatever secrets, volume mounts, environment variables and resource limits you need\n\nthere is no need to bundle a JVM or Jenkins Remoting container into the pod so you can keep resources and cost down\n\nWhy use Jenkins and Tekton together?\n\nJenkins is the most popular open source automation server around. Lots of developers use it every day to get things done.\nJenkins can now be used to automate Tekton pipelines too which helps teams digitally transform to more cloud native solutions for their CI and CD.\nIn such a case, you can use Tekton pipeline engine while getting all benefits from Jenkins as an orchestrator, user interface and the reporting engine.\n\nIntroducing the Tekton Plugin for Jenkins\n\nThe Tekton Client plugin for Jenkins lets you easily use Jenkins to automate creating and running Tekton pipelines.\nIt bridges the Kubernetes learning gap and allows invoking Tekton Pipelines and resources through Jenkins.\nThis allows users to not have much of the Kubernetes specific knowledge beforehand and work.\n\nIts a single Jenkins plugin to install - so it’s easy to use.\n\nFor background check out the  blog post Bridging the Gap with Tekton-client-plugin for Jenkins by the founder of the plugin Vibhav Bobade.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe Tekton Client plugin for jenkins assumes you have access to a kubernetes cluster.\n\nThe kubernetes cluster should have Tekton pipelines installed.\n\nIf you have not yet installed Tekton you could use this tekton helm chart\n\nThe Jenkins controller should also have kubernetes RBAC access to be able to create Tekton resources and watch them and their associated pods and pod logs.\n\nIf you are running your Jenkins controller inside Kubernetes then an easy way to setup the RBAC is to install the Jenkins Resource Helm Chart in the same namespace as your Jenkins controller.\n\nAnother option is to use an installation of Jenkins X and let it setup a Jenkins controller via GitOps\n\nSpecifying the Tekton pipelines\n\nYou can configure the Tekton pipeline via:\n\na file path in a git clone block\n\na URL to a tekton YAML file\n\na block of YAML\n\nWe recommend defining Tekton pipelines as YAML files and checking them into a git repository so that you can use GitOps and follow the Pipeline As Code pattern.\n\nThis means that you can version your pipelines in git. It also means you can benefit from the various IDE plugins available for Tekton such as VS Code and IDEA so that you get auto completion, formatting and validation while editing the YAML.\n\nSo you can use the usual Git provider support in Jenkins to clone the git repository that contains then Tekton YAML file then reference the file by name.\n\nReusing Pipelines from the Tekton Catalog\n\nThe Tekton Catalog defines a ton of Tekton Tasks you can reuse in your pipelines\n\nWe have found when it comes to a microsevices style architecture you end up with lots of repositories and pipelines. Then using a Pipeline As Code pattern with GitOps we want to Version Everything but also make it easy for any repository to use any version of any task or pipeline.\n\ne.g. you may have many repositories using the current version of a pipeline but want to try out a new change to the pipeline in just 1 repository to verify it works well; then if it does, incrementally roll that change out to more repositories.\n\nThis can make it hard trying to reuse as much as you can across the different git repositories while also minimising the number of versions and forks of git repositories you have and simplifying the maintenance of all of the pipelines.\n\nWe have found on the Jenkins X project that a nice way to do this via GitOps such that we reference versioned Tekton Tasks and Pipelines in git so that they are easy to reuse or override.\n\nSo we reuse Tasks and Pipelines via the uses: image notation which lets us keep all of our Tekton Tasks and Pipelines in vanilla Tekton YAML; so that the IDE completion and validation works - but we can easily reuse Tasks or steps from libraries while also Versioning Everything\n\nNote that if wish to reuse steps/tasks via the uses: image notation then you must click the Tekton Catalog flag in your Job definition which will then resolve the uses: clause with the actual step/task.\n\nWhat is Jenkins X?\n\nThe Jenkins X project automates your CI/CD on kubernetes to help you accelerate :\n\nAutomated CI/CD pipelines lets you focus on your actually application code while Jenkins X automatically creates battle tested Tekton CI/CD pipelines for your project which are managed via GitOps so that its super easy to keep your pipelines up to date across your repositories or to upgrade or override pipelines or steps for specific repositories.\n\nAutomatic promotion of versioned artifacts via GitOps through your Environments such as Staging, Pre-production and Production whether they are running in the same kubernetes cluster or you are using multiple clusters for your environments\n\nPreview Environments lets you propose code changes via Pull Requests and have a Preview Environment automatically created, running your code in kubernetes to get fast feedback from your team before agreeing to merge changes to the main branch\n\nChatOps comment on Pull Requests to give feedback, approve/hold changes, trigger optional pipelines for additional testing and other ChatOps commands\n\nAll of the above is implemented in reusable Tekton pipelines.\n\nReusing Jenkins X Pipelines\n\nSo how can we reuse automated CI/CD pipelines from Jenkins X project from Jenkins?\n\nMake sure you have the Tekton Client plugin for Jenkins installed in your Jenkins server.\n\nUsing a working template\n\nIf you want to start with a working example then\n\nCreate A Git Repository From This Template\n\nadd a new Frestyle project to your Jenkins server\n\nenable the Git source code management for your new github.com repository\n\nclick Add build Step (near the bottom of the page) and then select Tekton : Create Resource (Raw)\n\nmake sure that FILE is selected for the input and enter the name.lighthouse/jenkins-x/release.yaml for the file name\n\nif you are using a Jenkins X cluster enter jx for the namespace\n\nensure that Enable Tekton Catalog is checked\n\nnow save the pipeline - it should look something like this:\n\nNow if you trigger the pipeline you should see it create a Tekton Pipeline and you should see the output of the tekton pipeline in the Jenkins console. The pipeline is actually running as a completely separate Pod in kubernetes; the Jenkins controller just tails the log into the console.\n\nIn a Jenkins X cluster this pipeline should just work (reusing all the cloud resources and IAM roles setup by the Terraform) but in an arbitrary kubernetes cluster you may get issues around not being able to push images or promote due to lack of GitOps environments being defined which we can help you work through via the Jenkins X slack room\n\nUsing an existing repository\n\nYou can configure a Pull Request or Release pipeline in your project by copying the YAML file for the language pack you wish to use.\n\ne.g. if you are using maven then copy pullrequest.yaml or release.yaml into your projects source code then reference it from your Jenkins Job:\n\nThen follow the above instructions for setting up a Freestyle project for your git repository and referencing the file name for your pipeline.\n\nOverriding steps\n\nBeing able to reuse steps from libraries of pipelines is awesome; but sometimes you need to change things. The assumptions, commands, arguments, environment variables or approaches used for every step in a library may not quite match what you need on a specific application. You may need to run steps before/after steps in the library or you may need to override a specific step to do something different.\n\nYou can easily customize any inherited step in any shared pipeline or add custom steps before/after any step.\n\nThe fact that all the Tekton YAML is fully declarative makes it super easy to modify things via your IDE with validation and smart completion and not have to use a scripting language and understand complex shared pipeline libraries.\n\nThe easiest way to try overriding a step is to install the jx binary to your $PATH then use the jx pipeline override command which will create a new locally overridden step you can then just edit in your IDE.\n\nThen at any time you can view the effective pipeline when you make local changes\n\nComparing the Kubernetes and Tekton plugins\n\nThose of you using Jenkins on a Kubernetes cluster are probably using the kubernetes plugin right now.\n\nHere is an example of how to use a Jenkinsfile with a pod YAML file so that you can run commands in different containers in the pod.\n\nWhat this means is that:\n\na kubernetes pod is created based on the pod YAML file which is scheduled by kubernetes\n\nthe Jenkinsfile runs on the Jenkins controller talking over Jenkins remoting to the pod to tell it to run commands in different containers. The pod includes the jnlp container which does the remoting between the Jenkins controller and the pod\n\nThis has a few issues:\n\neach container in the pod must have a shell so that jnlp can invoke commands. This may mean you have to create your own images\n\nit can be a little slow to start since there is chattiness with the Jenkins controller and the pod - whereas with Tekton pods just start and run locally without any coodination with the Jenkins controller\n\nyou have to maintain 2 files: the Jenkinsfile and the pod.yaml and it’s hard to share/override both of those files across multiple repositories as you need to make changes (e.g. overriding environment variables/images/commands/resource limits on demand on steps).\n\nThough one downside of the tekton approach is that by default there is no automatic synchronisation of state; after a Task in tekton completes there’s no automatic upload of state to the Jenkins controllers disk. You can always add a step in your Task to upload workspace state to the Jenkins controller if that’s what you want.\n\nThough remember that tekton plugin doesn’t take anything away; so you can mix and match the kubernetes and tekton plugins to suit your needs.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe are really excited about the combination of Jenkins, Tekton and Jenkins X letting developers pick the best tool for the job while becoming more cloud native and increasing the automation help reduce the amount of manual work creating and maintaining pipelines while also helping to improve the quality and practices of our CI/CD.\n\nPlease try it out and let us know how you get on!","title":"Easily reuse Tekton and Jenkins X from Jenkins","tags":["jenkins-x","kubernetes","pipeline","tekton","gitops","interoperability"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"jstrachan","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>James is a long time open source contributor, created the Groovy programming language and Apache Camel integration framework.\nFor the past few years he&#8217;s been working on CI/CD with Kubernetes.</p>\n</div>","id":"jstrachan","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"James Strachan","slug":"/blog/author/jstrachan","twitter":"jstrachan"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a9230039-d1c0-5968-b24d-fc0746acc97a","slug":"/blog/2021/04/15/jenkins-operator-sub-project/","strippedHtml":"We are happy to announce that Jenkins Operator officially became an official Jenkins sub-project.\n\nWhat does it mean for the project?\n\nBecoming an official part of the Jenkins project was a major step towards better alignment with the overall Jenkins’ roadmap and more opportunities to increase adoption of the Jenkins Operator project.\n\nFinally, with a dedicated team at VirtusLab actively maintaining the project we can engage with the wider community and participate in some of the Cloud-Native SIG meetings.\nThis opens a room for everyone to voice their opinions or start supporting the project.\n\nWe truly believe that this community engagement will result in significant improvements to Jenkins Operator, as well as the Jenkins ecosystem itself.\n\nBridging the gap between Jenkins and Kubernetes\n\nRunning Jenkins in a cloud-native environment like Kubernetes is not a trivial task.\nWith Jenkins Operator project we want to enable the community to take full advantage of Kubernetes and public cloud capabilities by:\n\nnative integration with public cloud services in areas of observability, storage and cloud security\n\nKubernetes autoscaling and self-healing mechanism\n\nsecure access to Jenkins instance\n\ndeclarative configuration using Kubernetes Custom Resources\n\nfull lifecycle management, eventually transforming it to autopilot\n\nTake part in the journey toward global trends\n\nStart contributing and play an important role in creating the automated Jenkins experience! Don’t hesitate - engage in the community.\nJoin us in our work of creating the functionalities you see beneficial.\nYou are welcome to create issues and pull requests. We are actively resolving community issues and providing answers on a dedicated Slack channel.\n\nAs the project has been initially developed and still actively maintained by VirtusLab, we started discussion towards an open governance model to facilitate communication and collaboration.\n\nLead the way we are heading by providing us feedback\n\nTo celebrate the new possibilities that are being opened for our project, we would like to invite you to take part in a short survey that will help put us on the right track.\nIf you have been using Jenkins Operator or running Jenkins in any other environment, please take a moment to fill out our quick survey.\nWe will choose at least three of the most informative answers and send you an awesome Jenkins Operator T-shirt with our cute Gopher butler.\nThe survey can be found here. Remember, the most sincere answers are the best.\n\nAnd if you still haven’t used Jenkins Kubernetes Operator, you’re more than welcome to do so.\nGive it a shot and discover a new kind of simplicity of running Jenkins.\n\nHow to get started.","title":"Jenkins Operator becomes an official

She Code Africa Contributhon started April 1, 2021.\nThe She Code Africa Contributhon is a boot camp where African women are paid to work with open source organizations on selected projects with dedicated mentors.\nThis program aims to create a more diverse, inclusive, and innovative culture within the African open source ecosystem by matching African women in technology with sponsor and mentor open source organizations.\nThe 5 mentees joining the Jenkins project come from Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda.\n\nThe Jenkins project has been accepted as a Contributhon mentoring organization.\nOur project idea will introduce mentees to Jenkins and plugin development as they create Pipeline examples and create Pipeline help for Jenkins Pipeline plugins.\n\nTwice weekly mentoring sessions are scheduled with the mentees and are listed in the events calendar.\nWe’ve already received the first pull request to improve the embedded documentation that generates the Steps Reference and provides contextual help in the Snippet Generator.\nWe’re looking forward to more pull requests and more improvements throughout April, 2021.\n\nWe’d like to introduce our mentees so
