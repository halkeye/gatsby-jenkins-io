To understand how to configure credentials in a Jenkins environment: Using Credentials\n\ngitToolName\n\nName of the git installation in the machine running the Jenkins instance\n(Check Global Tool Configuration section in Jenkins UI)\n\nNote: In case a user is not aware of the git tool installation of the particular machine, the default git installation will be chosen.\n\nExamples\n\nThe withCredentials wrapper allows declarative and scripted Pipeline jobs to perform authenticated command line git operations with sh , bat , and powershell tasks.\n\nShell example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  sh 'git fetch --all'\n}\n\nBatch example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  bat 'git submodule update --init --recursive'\n}\n\nPowershell example\n\nwithCredentials([gitUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', gitToolName: 'git-tool')]) {\n  powershell 'git push'\n}\n\nThe Pipeline Syntax Snippet Generator is a good way to explore the syntax of the withCredentials step and the git username / password credentials binding.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe git credentials username / password binding has been tested on command line git versions 1.8.3 through 2.32.0.\nIt has been tested on CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Debian 9, Debian 10, FreeBSD 12, OpenBSD 6.9, openSUSE 15.2, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 21.04, and Windows 10.\nProcessor testing has included amd64, arm32, arm64, and s390x.\n\nThe binding does not support private key credentials.\nThe binding is not supported on command line git versions prior to 1.8.3.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nPrivate key credentials support is coming soon.","title":"Git username / password credentials

to all GSoC students who have made it through the first half of the GSoC 2021 coding phase!\n\nThis year, the Jenkins project has been participating in GSoC as part of the Continuous Delivery Foundation’s GSoC org.\nTo celebrate our GSoC students and the fantastic work they have been doing, the CDF is hosting an online meetup where students will present their work.\nStudents will be showcasing what they have learned and accomplished thus far in GSoC, demoing their work, and discussing their goals and plans for the second coding phase.\n\nThe CDF Google Summer of Code Midterm Demos will be held online on July 20th, 13:00 UTC - 15:00 UTC.\n\nSign up here: Meetup Event\n\nSpeakers\n\nAkihiro Kiuchi - Jenkins Remoting Monitoring\n\nAkihiro is a student in the Department of information and communication engineering at the University of Tokyo.\nHe is improving the monitoring experience of Jenkins Remoting during Google Summer of Code 2021.\n\nAffiliation: The University of Tokyo and Jenkins project\n\nGitHub: Aki-7\n\nTitle: Jenkins Remoting Monitoring with OpenTelemetry\n\nIn this talk, he will discuss the problems in maintaining Jenkins agents and how to support Jenkins admins in troubleshooting them.\nAs one of the solutions, he will introduce the new Remoting monitoring with OpenTelemetry plugin that collects Jenkins Remoting monitoring data and troubleshooting data using OpenTelemetry.\nWhat kind of data the plugin will collect and how we will be able to visualize them using available open-source monitoring tools will be demonstrated.\n\nShruti Chaturvedi - CloudEvents Plugin for Jenkins\n\nShruti is an undergrad student of Computer Science at Kalamazoo College.\nShe is developing a CloudEvents integration for Jenkins, allowing other CloudEvents-compliant CI/CD tools to communicate easily.\nShruti is also the Founding Engineer of a California-based startup, MeetKlara, where she is building serverless solutions and advocating for developing CI/CD pipelines using open-source tools.\n\nAffiliation: Kalamazoo College and Jenkins project\n\nGitHub: ShrutiC-git\n\nLinkedIn: Shruti Chaturvedi\n\nTitle: CloudEvents Plugin for Jenkins: Moving Towards Interoperability\n\nIn this talk, we will look at interoperability as an essential element in building workloads across several services.\nWe will also talk about how CloudEvents solves one of the biggest challenges in achieving interoperability between systems: lack of normalization/standardization.\nWithout any standard definition, in order to achieve interoperability, services have to develop adapters specific to a particular system.\nThat, however, is complex because services are always changing the way data/events are emitted.\nCloudEvents solves this problem by defining a standard format for events, which can be emitted/consumed agnostically, thereby achieving indirect interoperability.\nShruti will demonstrate the workings of CloudEvents Plugin for Jenkins; she will walk us through how Jenkins can be configured as a source and a sink, emitting and consuming CloudEvents-compliant events in a platform-independent manner.\n\nDaniel Ko - try.spinnaker.io\n\nDaniel is studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.\nHe is developing a public Spinnaker sandbox environment for Google Summer of Code 2021.\n\nAffiliation: University of Wisconsin - Madison and Spinnaker project\n\nGitHub: ko28\n\nTitle: try.spinnaker.io:  Explore Spinnaker in a Sandbox Environment!\n\nThe talk will go through a brief explanation of Spinnaker and the challenges that users face during the installation process.\nHe will discuss the infrastructure of this project and how a public multi tenant spinnaker instance will be managed and installed.\nWe will end with a demo of the site so far and the various features implemented, including Github authentication, K8s manifest deployment, AWS Load Balancer Controller to expose deployments, private ECR registry and the blocking of all public images, and auto resource cleanup.\n\nAditya Srivastava - Conventional Commits Plugin for

is a CI/CD solution and as such, it is critical that the open source plugins that constitute an integral part of it don’t expose the systems they are used on to any security risks and vulnerabilities.\nIt is in that context that we worked as an audit/code review team to track and report such flaws and problematic practices.\n\nWe worked in collaboration with Jenkins Security team member Wadeck Follonier, as part of an end-of-study project during our last year of the Master’s Degree - Reliability and IT Security in the university of Aix-Marseille.\n\nProject Goals\n\nThe main goal of this project was to allow us to discover and work on diverse security vulnerabilities in the context of a widely-used software solution, and in order to achieve that we had to separate the project in multiple other goals:\n\nLearning about some of the most common vulnerabilities and the form in which they can be found on a Jenkins Instance and its plugins.\n\nPerforming code review and technical audit on the application, and compiling our results as part of a security team.\n\nReporting our findings to the Jenkins team and the plugin maintainers, while sometimes helping the latter to correct these vulnerabilities.\n\nKnowledge Sharing\n\nAt the beginning of the project, we set up communication channels with our mentor through Slack and Google Meets, and agreed to schedule weekly sessions with him.\nThe goal of these sessions was both to teach us more about the functionalities of Jenkins and the types of vulnerabilities we would encounter, and to allow us to ask more specific questions regarding our findings.\n\nThanks to our mentor developing a mock plugin compiling a variety of classic vulnerabilities and several of their implementations, including server side request forgery ( SSRF), cross site scripting ( XSS), and XML external entity ( XXE) attacks, we have been able to learn through practice.\nIt allowed us to analyze the context of the code and the different ways the Jelly framework can be used to display information, expanding our payload options and giving us a clearer view of the patterns to look for during our code reviews.\n\nWe have also had the opportunity to learn about the process used to report the vulnerabilities to the maintainers through Jira issues, and some ways we could correct them or provide steps to do so.\n\nSearching and compiling\n\nAt first, we decided to work as a pretty loose team, with each member working on a different plugin and regrouping our findings to confirm or reject them, while staying in constant contact to ask each other questions.\nThis allowed us to broaden the scope of our searches, and is the reason why we have been able to find a larger number of vulnerabilities, in plugins that differed widely in popularity, than we would have working together from the start.\n\nWe used a single file to compile the plugins we audited and our findings, making it easier for our mentor to review them and give us feedback.\nPinpointing the specific portion of code causing the issue and providing reproduction steps as clear as we could proved useful for the reporting process, thus making the approval and correction faster.\n\nDuring the last third of this project, we began to work together on bigger plugins, in order to have more points of view reflecting on the same problem.\nWith different analyses, we were able to come up with new payloads, and sometimes with new vulnerabilities where we only found one separately.\n\nReporting and correcting the vulnerabilities\n\nAll of the reporting was done through Jira issues, which allows the Jenkins team to centralize and triage the vulnerabilities.\nOnce we provided the necessary information, along with the reproduction steps we had, a member of the Jenkins security team contacted the plugin maintainer and guided them through the next steps of the process, with hope that they would answer.\n\nWe have also tried to make the maintainers' job easier, working on some fixes.\nTo achieve this, we delved not only into the functionalities of the vulnerable plugins, but also into some mitigation processes that we found either in the Jenkins documentation,  or with the help of our mentor.\n\nEach one of our modifications has been tested locally, in order to assess whether the vulnerability was still present, and whether no function had been altered.\nHowever, some of the plugins we audited demanded more complex fixes, due to their intrinsic logic, or the thought process of their developer, which led to us being unable to provide a clear fix.\n\nConsidering this, the fixes we have been able to bring into light were only suggestions to the maintainers, for them to use as inspiration or template, in order not to interfere with the plugin logic.\n\nConclusion\n\nThrough this project, we have been able to work as a team, delving into some of the different issues that security engineers are bound to face, and the ways they have at their disposal to mitigate them.\nThis has allowed us to complement our studies with a more practical aspect, that we couldn’t have had otherwise, and to transition into the companies we are now interns in.\nThis experience has strongly encouraged us to improve in and document ourselves on this branch of cybersecurity, which will have a significant impact on our professional future.\n\nUseful links\n\nJenkins - 2021/03/30 Security Advisory - 5 from us\n\nJenkins - 2021/05/11 Security Advisory - 4 from us\n\nJenkins - 2021/05/25 Security Advisory - 3 from

to learn new things, new tricks.\nTheir curiosity helped them to find numerous vulnerabilities that already led to 14 published CVEs.\nThe experience was great and I wish them all the best for their professional career and their never ending quest for knowledge.\n\nIf you are student, intern, or just someone really interested in security and Jenkins in particularly, please reach out to us to see if there is a possibility to organize something together.\nMailing list: jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com","title":"Four students and their master project in Jenkins

are happy to announce that\nthe Jenkins community has moved all its official IRC channels to Libera chat.\nWe have started our migration on May 26 as a response to the\nhostile takeover\nof hundreds of open source community channel by the new Freenode management.\nAs decided  by the Jenkins governance meeting on June 16th,\nLibera Chat IRC channels are the only official channels going forward.\n\nA more detailed history of the transition is available on the Jenkins developers mailing list.\n\nWhat did we move?\n\nWe have created the following IRC chats:\n\nthat currently live on freenode to libera.chat:\n\n#jenkins - general discussion channel for Jenkins users and developers.\nWe no longer consider it a central chat for all things Jenkins, but we intend to keep it available to users\nwho want to keep using IRC.\n\n#jenkins-hosting - Chat used by the Hosting Team to manage hosting automation\n\n#jenkins-infra - Chat used by the Infrastructure Team to coordinate efforts related to Jenkins project infrastructure and the incident response\n\n#jenkins-release - Chat used for Jenkins core release coordination by the Release Team\n\nAll other channels have NOT been moved to Libera Chat IRC and were replaced by other channels.\nMost notable channels:\n\n#jenkins-meeting - the Jenkins Governance Meeting uses combination of Zoom and Google Docs at the moment. We do not longer use the IRC chat for that purpose.\n\n#jenkins-cert - no private chat going forward. The Security Team will use mailing lists only going forward\n\n#jenkins-community - Replaced by the Advocacy&Outreach Gitter channel.\n\nFreenode concerns and disclaimers\n\nGoing forward, the Jenkins community does not have ANY official channels on Freenode.\nAll channels are either removed or left abandoned.\nWe no longer manage or control our channels.\nMost of the Jenkins IRC channel operators use IRCCloud,\nand hence they were banned by the Freenode team on June 11th.\nOnly a few operators have reconnected since this event.\n\nTaking the takeover of Freenode and hostile actions taken by the new management,\nwe can no longer guarantee any of the following:\n\nAuthenticity of registered users on Freenode.\nAll IRC accounts, cloaked or not, might have been taken over by the new Freenode management.\n Do not trust messages from the Jenkins contributor account IDs there.\n\nConfidentiality of private channels like #jenkins-cert.\nWe performed audit of the conversations there, and we believe there are no undisclosed security vulnerabilities referenced in the channel.\n After all, this IRC has been rather dormant for the last 18 months.\n\nIRC User Passwords.\nAll passwords on Freenode IRC may be compromised in the future.\nWe strongly advise all users to rotate their passwords if they were used on Freenode IRC.\n\nWe have made backups of IRC channel conversations in the abandoned channels.\nIf you need to access the conversation history, please reach out to the Jenkins Infrastructure team.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the entire Libera Chat team and all contributors who have worked on creating\na Freenode replacement for hundreds of open source communities using IRC.\nWithin just a month, a new platform has been created and adopted by almost all active projects.\nWe remember the Hudson to Jenkins renaming days when a similar mobilization happened in the Jenkins community,\nand we appreciate all the effort put by contributors.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels\nand our automation like the IRC Bot used by the Jenkins hosting team.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn the Jenkins community we will keep using Libera Chat IRC and maintaining user and contributor channels there.\nOther Jenkins chat channels like Gitter and Slack are unchanged.\nWe intend to gradually replace many of those channels with community.jenkins.io.\nThis is a new portal powered by Discourse.\nThe service is sponsored by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc..\nIt is

little over a year ago, we launched JenkinsIsTheWay.io, a website whose sole purpose is to share Jenkins user stories with the developers and engineers in our community.  Over a hundred of you have already shared your innovations, and they just keep coming.  It comes as no surprise that many of the submitted stories are from IT consultants and software developers around the world building next-generation DevOps and CI/CD platforms to fuel the modernization of enterprise companies far and wide.\n\nThat’s why we’ve dedicated our latest eBook to focus on Jenkins users in the global Information Technology sector.  We shine the spotlight on these developers and engineers who have solved unique software development and DevOps challenges by turning to the leading open source automation server.  From powering large enterprises needing a better way to manage their inventory to innovative tech firms looking to advance technologies and healthcare initiatives during a pandemic, you’ll read about how teams everywhere solved their unique challenges — with the help of Jenkins.\n\nJenkins is the Way to…\n\nIn our short User Story Survey, we ask Jenkins users to fill in the blank: Jenkins is the way to …​…​\n\nWe’ve seen results-oriented submissions like \"Jenkins is the way to deliver our new releases on time!\" and \"Jenkins is the way to understand and simplify your software workflows.\"  Several submissions riffed off of something like \"Jenkins is the way to completely automate your CI/CD workflow.\"  Meanwhile, others have had a bit more fun and languished praise on Jenkins, stating, \"Jenkins is the way to help teams focus on what is really important, make our life easier\" and, even, \"Jenkins is the way to save the day.\"\n\nIn this new eBook, we focus on the challenges users in the community face, and what they’ve built using Jenkins to achieve their unique goals. For example, Build & Release Manager, Donald Morton, turned to Jenkins to establish a flexible, modern, and more efficient DevOps platform for Graylog, a leading log management platform serving the enterprise.\n\nWith a Jenkins assist, Mark Baumann, DevOps Engineer with ITK Engineering, created “ one CI to rule them all.” He told us that “Jenkins provides a common CI/CD platform for all different kinds of projects and technology domains.”\n\nWhen IBM Lead Software Engineer Alec Rieger sought to simplify the build and testing pipeline for the company’s software engineers and developers, he also turned to Jenkins.  For a company the size of IBM, which services enterprise clients worldwide, Rieger wanted to help his colleagues manage many nodes on a large scale. Now, according to his Jenkins Is The Way user story, IBM uses Jenkins pipelines for each of their builds and relies on the flexibility and countless plugin features to continually improve their processes.\n\nStronger, Smarter, Faster Software Innovation\n\nWhile we all fondly think of Jenkins as a modest butler who has empowered developers with the open-source tools they need to succeed — on JenkinsIsTheWay.io, we liken him to an unpretentious, yet powerful superhero.  And like any great superhero, he (or she!) is sure to save the day.\n\nFor our Jenkins users, that means results — significant, measurable results with a common theme.  Using Jenkins has enabled you — the user — to help the businesses you serve save money, spin up software faster, and automate processes.  In doing so, you’ve freed up developers and engineers from countless hours of mundane tasks.  Thanks to Jenkins, you’re empowering entire IT teams to innovate, focus on what they love to do and, ultimately, build great stuff.\n\nOf course, we devote much of our latest eBook to those victories.  Results like how RedHat’s releases are 5x faster thanks to Jenkins.  The fact that DevOps problem tickets were reduced by over 90% for Electronic Health Solutions.  And why the CTO at Cloudologia was psyched to share that — with a Jenkins at the helm — they were able to shorten onboarding for deployment & build release cycles from one week to a single day.\n\nShare Your User Story, Too!\n\nI am proud to share another common theme from the users who have submitted their story:  you turn to our community for collaboration, guidance, and advice.  A community of a million strong and growing, this eBook and JenkinsIsTheWay.io are other ways to provide you with the insight and lessons learned by developers and engineers, like you, to innovate and build next-generation technologies for companies of all sizes.\n\nWhen you’re ready to tell your story, we’re prepared to help you share it. Fill out our short questionnaire, and we’ll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt as a thank you once it’s published!\n\nLinks\n\nJenkins IsThe Way.

Updating the jenkins.yaml file\n\nReload the existing configuration to apply the system message change\n\nNow, go back to the Dashboard and you can see the updated System Message on top:\n\nFigure 2. Viewing the changes on Dashboard\n\nThis file will be used later to configure the plugin using JCasC.\n\nConfigure the plugin on the UI\n\nFor this demo, install the View Job Filters plugin.\n\nLet’s create a view by clicking on the New View option on the left side of the Dashboard.\n\nGive it a name (say, “testView”) and set its type to List View, and click on the OK button.\n\nFigure 3. Creating the View\n\nNow click on Add Job Filter to add any kind of filter, so let’s select Build Duration Filter and fill the field with any value (say, \"60\" minutes),\n\nFigure 4. Adding filter to the view\n\nClick on Apply Save.\n\nTo view the full configuration, check out your main jenkins.yaml configuration file, by clicking on Manage Jenkins Configuration as Code View Configuration\n\nGo to the views section in this YAML file to see details related to the view,\n\nFigure 5. Here, details regarding the view (which we just created) is visible\n\nDownload the Configuration\n\nNow that you have successfully configured your plugin by UI, let’s download the configuration by going to Manage Jenkins on the Dashboard, then click on Configuration as Code under \"System Configuration\".\n\nNow click on the Download Configuration button to save the configuration file locally.\n\nFigure 6. Downloading the Configuration\n\nUpdate JCasC file locally\n\nAdd some changes in your downloaded copy of the jenkins.yaml file, to see those changes being automatically reflected on the UI.\n\nFor demo purposes, let’s change the name to “YoutubeDemoView” and set the buildDurationMinutes as \"55\".\n\nFigure 7. Changing the View details locally\n\nSave the file.\n\nLoad the jenkins.yaml file on the Jenkins server\n\nNow to reflect the local changes done in the jenkins.yaml file onto the Jenkins server, click on the Reload existing configuration button.\n\nFigure 8. Applying the New Configuration to the Jenkins instance\n\nVerify the changes on the UI\n\nGo back to the main page by clicking on the Jenkins logo on the top-left side.\n\nAnd you will notice that the name of your view has been changed from \"testView\" to “YoutubeDemoView”,\n\nAnd the field value of Build Duration Filter has been changed from \"60\" to “55”.\n\nThese two are the exact changes that we did locally in our jenkins.yaml file.\n\nFigure 9. Verifying the changes\n\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully configured a plugin (“View Job Filter”) automatically with the help of the “Jenkins Configuration as Code” plugin! You can repeat the same process for other plugins as well.","title":"Configure Plugins with JCasC","tags":["jcasc","tutorial","plugins","yaml"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#586868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/55658/dheerajodha.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/3af71/dheerajodha.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/226ae/dheerajodha.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/55658/dheerajodha.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/3dc24/dheerajodha.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/bf13b/dheerajodha.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/12101/dheerajodha.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/e9db2/dheerajodha.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/6fafe/dheerajodha.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":145}}},"blog":null,"github":"dheerajodha","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Dheeraj is a Computer Science Engineering student (senior) at Vivekanand Institute of Technology, University of Mumbai.
