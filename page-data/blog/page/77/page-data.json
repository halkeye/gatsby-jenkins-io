Scientists are arguably even worse off: most of them are not trained as software engineers, yet, in the last decades, creating custom software has become an integral part of virtually any research activity, be it data analysis, simulation or experiments. Frequently, there is a great emphasis on numerical accuracy and reproducibility of results, which requires extensive testing. As a coup de grâce, most publicly funded research projects are running on tight budgets, excluding the possibility of hiring professional contractors to outsource required software development work. +\n +\n\n+\nEnter Jenkins the Butler! +\n +\n\n+\nBack in 2011, Yury V. Zaytsev, a doctoral candidate now working at Jülich Research Center, Germany was supported by a Google Summer of Code stipend to design a continuous integration infrastructure for http://www.nest-initiative.org[NEST], a spiking neuronal network simulator for neuroscientific research released under the GPL license. An overwhelmingly positive experience with this new setup motivated him to write up https://www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/10.3389/fninf.2012.00031/abstract[a case study], which was recently published in \"Frontiers in Neuroinformatics\", an open access scientific journal. +\n +\n\n+\n\"The new CI system boosts our productivity, because it helps us find and fix breakages very quickly, even when they only occur for obscure combinations of configuration options. Automated integration testing is a major breakthrough for NEST, as it ensures that developing new features does not come at the cost of reliability or accuracy\" - said Markus Diesmann, director of the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6) at the Jülich Research Center, Germany and NEST Initiative board member. +\n +\n\n+\nWe hope that through a peer-reviewed publication in a prominent scientific journal we will be able to reach the scientific community more efficiently, as compared to the materials targeting professional software developers. However, we likewise believe that our case study might be of interest to the readers of this blog, especially those who are still only considering implementing continuous integration. +\n +\n\n+\nLastly, we would like to thank all developers and users of Jenkins whose contributions throughout the years made it the versatile and robust continuous integration server it is today!","title":"Neuroscientists embrace continuous integration served by Jenkins","tags":["general","guest post","cia"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d3f50617-8e9b-5a69-9de7-800672ba931d","slug":"/blog/2013/03/12/coming-to-gdc-join-us-for-a-jenkins-drink-up-at-21st-amendment/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution[image:http://www.nationalreview.com/sites/default/files/nfs/uploaded/u23105/2012/12/amendment%2021%202.jpeg[image]] +\n\n+\n +\nIf you are coming to https://www.gdconf.com/[Game Developers Conference] in the week of 25th, or if you are local to San Francisco bay area, come join us to the small drink up in the evening of 26th at http://21st-amendment.com/[21st amendment]. +\n +\n\n+\nIf you are coming, https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/108919962/[please RSVP] so that we know how many to expect, and we can stay connected.","title":"Coming to GDC?

All in all we counted 721 responses --- thanks everyone for voicing their thoughts! +\n +\n\n+\nNaturally, it took a while to tally that many responses, but thanks to https://twitter.com/ProductPrincipl[Lisa], we https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb[now have the result] in time for the holiday. +\n +\n\n+\nAs you can see in https://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/total-jenkins.svg[our installation tracking], Jenkins installation base has grown 66% since the last year, so I was naturally very curious if this has affected the area of focus for us the developers. +\n +\n\n+\nHowever, when https://pages.cloudbees.com/Jenkins_Survey_2011_JenkinsSurveyDownloadPage.html[compared to the result from the last year], the first thing I notice is the consistency in many metrics. For example, about 83% of people considers Jenkins mission critical this year, and the last year it was 82%. The distribution between beginner/intermediate/expert users are also quite similar. +\n +\n\n+\nBut this year, we asked a number of questions that we didn’t ask the last year. One of them is the version control systems that people use. Here, we get 61% Subversion, 50% Git, and everything else is within 10%. So clearly we need to start shipping Git plugin pre-bundled! +\n +\n\n+\nAnother interesting question that we asked is the languages people use. There’s a surprising number of C/C++ projects on Jenkins (and good number of Ruby, PHP, Python, and C#!), which made me feel that we need to hear more from those users about the kind of tool integrations we need to be providing. +\n +\n\n+\nOne more gem is that whopping 11% of the respondents said they have written and contributed plugins to the community (that’s 82 people!), and another 9% of the respondents said they wrote one but just not sharing it because it doesn’t make sense (7%), or they couldn’t (2%). That’s about 1 in every 5 respondents writing some plugins, which is amazing, if you ask me. +\n +\n\n+\nAnother big part of the survey was asking respondents what are important in Jenkins --- is it documentation, quality, UI, etc? But I guess I shouldn’t spoil your fun of actually https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb[looking at the result], so please go take a look yourself! Also, if you want to tally the numbers yourself, here’s the anonymized raw data. +\n +\n\n+\nI’ll hopefully do a separate post on the efforts we are taking to answer those points raised in the survey in coming days. +","title":"2012 Jenkins Survey results are in","tags":["general","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"2eaec6cf-6301-5d69-8962-b52a70cf9ccf","slug":"/blog/2012/12/25/jenkins-meet-up/","strippedHtml":"\">\n\n우리는 2013년 1월25일 저녁에 Jenkins meet-up을 삼성전자와 함께 준비하고 있습니다.\nMeet-up은 서초사옥에서 진행될 예정이며 추후 변경될 수 있습니다.\n발표자는 일본 커뮤니티에서 활동중인 Cactuman과 삼성이고 Groovy script를 이용한 job 일괄설정\n에 대해서 발표할 예정입니다.\n\nJenkins를 설치한 통계를 통해 저희도 한국에 많은 사용자가 있다는것을 알고 있었습니다.\n지금까지는 메인 Jenkins community에서 컨택하는데 실패했었지만 이번에 그런 상황이 해결된것에 너무 흥분됩니다.\n\n이번 meet-up에 참가할 의사가 있으면 meetup.com 에 회답해 주시면 됩니다.\n참가비는 없으며 우리는 Jenkins,plugin 들과 함께한 경험들(간단한 주제를 포함)을 한국의 Jenkins user와\n공유 할 더 많은 발표자를 찾고 있습니다.\n\n여러분의 많은 참가를 기대합니다.\n\nWe are organizing a Jenkins meet-up in Seoul in the evening of Jan 25th 2013, thanks to the help of folks at Samsung. The meeting will be in the evening, at the location to be determined. I am presenting in person, as well as Cactusman, one of the key community people in Japan. Seung-Heui Jang from Samsung would be presenting about job batch processing by Groovy scripts.\n\nAccording to the installation statistics, we know there are significant user base in Korea, but so far the main Jenkins community has failed to establish contacts with them. I’m really excited that I can finally fix this situation!\n\nIf you are interested in coming, please RSVP at meetup.com. The event will be free. We are still looking for a few more speakers (including lightning talks), so please share your experiences with Jenkins, plugins you’ve been working on, and so forth with the rest of the Korean Jenkins people.\n\nLooking forward to seeing many of you!","title":"한국에서의 첫번째 Jenkins meet-up!","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":608,"numPages":100,"currentPage":77}},
