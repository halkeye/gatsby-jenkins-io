Scientists are arguably even worse off: most of them are not trained as software engineers, yet, in the last decades, creating custom software has become an integral part of virtually any research activity, be it data analysis, simulation or experiments. Frequently, there is a great emphasis on numerical accuracy and reproducibility of results, which requires extensive testing. As a coup de grâce, most publicly funded research projects are running on tight budgets, excluding the possibility of hiring professional contractors to outsource required software development work. +\n +\n\n+\nEnter Jenkins the Butler! +\n +\n\n+\nBack in 2011, Yury V. Zaytsev, a doctoral candidate now working at Jülich Research Center, Germany was supported by a Google Summer of Code stipend to design a continuous integration infrastructure for http://www.nest-initiative.org[NEST], a spiking neuronal network simulator for neuroscientific research released under the GPL license. An overwhelmingly positive experience with this new setup motivated him to write up https://www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/10.3389/fninf.2012.00031/abstract[a case study], which was recently published in \"Frontiers in Neuroinformatics\", an open access scientific journal. +\n +\n\n+\n\"The new CI system boosts our productivity, because it helps us find and fix breakages very quickly, even when they only occur for obscure combinations of configuration options. Automated integration testing is a major breakthrough for NEST, as it ensures that developing new features does not come at the cost of reliability or accuracy\" - said Markus Diesmann, director of the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6) at the Jülich Research Center, Germany and NEST Initiative board member. +\n +\n\n+\nWe hope that through a peer-reviewed publication in a prominent scientific journal we will be able to reach the scientific community more efficiently, as compared to the materials targeting professional software developers. However, we likewise believe that our case study might be of interest to the readers of this blog, especially those who are still only considering implementing continuous integration. +\n +\n\n+\nLastly, we would like to thank all developers and users of Jenkins whose contributions throughout the years made it the versatile and robust continuous integration server it is today!","title":"Neuroscientists embrace continuous integration served by Jenkins","tags":["general","guest post","cia"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d3f50617-8e9b-5a69-9de7-800672ba931d","slug":"/blog/2013/03/12/coming-to-gdc-join-us-for-a-jenkins-drink-up-at-21st-amendment/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution[image:http://www.nationalreview.com/sites/default/files/nfs/uploaded/u23105/2012/12/amendment%2021%202.jpeg[image]] +\n\n+\n +\nIf you are coming to https://www.gdconf.com/[Game Developers Conference] in the week of 25th, or if you are local to San Francisco bay area, come join us to the small drink up in the evening of 26th at http://21st-amendment.com/[21st amendment]. +\n +\n\n+\nIf you are coming, https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/108919962/[please RSVP] so that we know how many to expect, and we can stay connected.","title":"Coming to GDC?

All in all we counted 721 responses --- thanks everyone for voicing their thoughts! +\n +\n\n+\nNaturally, it took a while to tally that many responses, but thanks to https://twitter.com/ProductPrincipl[Lisa], we https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb[now have the result] in time for the holiday. +\n +\n\n+\nAs you can see in https://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/total-jenkins.svg[our installation tracking], Jenkins installation base has grown 66% since the last year, so I was naturally very curious if this has affected the area of focus for us the developers. +\n +\n\n+\nHowever, when https://pages.cloudbees.com/Jenkins_Survey_2011_JenkinsSurveyDownloadPage.html[compared to the result from the last year], the first thing I notice is the consistency in many metrics. For example, about 83% of people considers Jenkins mission critical this year, and the last year it was 82%. The distribution between beginner/intermediate/expert users are also quite similar. +\n +\n\n+\nBut this year, we asked a number of questions that we didn’t ask the last year. One of them is the version control systems that people use. Here, we get 61% Subversion, 50% Git, and everything else is within 10%. So clearly we need to start shipping Git plugin pre-bundled! +\n +\n\n+\nAnother interesting question that we asked is the languages people use. There’s a surprising number of C/C++ projects on Jenkins (and good number of Ruby, PHP, Python, and C#!), which made me feel that we need to hear more from those users about the kind of tool integrations we need to be providing. +\n +\n\n+\nOne more gem is that whopping 11% of the respondents said they have written and contributed plugins to the community (that’s 82 people!), and another 9% of the respondents said they wrote one but just not sharing it because it doesn’t make sense (7%), or they couldn’t (2%). That’s about 1 in every 5 respondents writing some plugins, which is amazing, if you ask me. +\n +\n\n+\nAnother big part of the survey was asking respondents what are important in Jenkins --- is it documentation, quality, UI, etc?

We are still looking for a few more speakers (including lightning talks), so please share your experiences with Jenkins, plugins you’ve been working on, and so forth with the rest of the Korean Jenkins people.\n\nLooking forward to seeing many of you!","title":"한국에서의 첫번째 Jenkins meet-up!","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"8ac5933a-96b7-5a2b-9d41-2181c54255a5","slug":"/blog/2012/12/20/jenkins-keynote-at-fosdem-2013/","strippedHtml":"Earlier this year we participated in FOSDEM 2012 in Brussels, Belgium. Overall the event was a major success and we’re very happy we were able to take part in it!\n\nFor FOSDEM 2013, we’ll be back in Brussels and participating in a major way. The first day of FOSDEM (February 2, 2013) will be the 2nd birthday for the Jenkins project, and seems appropriate that project founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi will be giving a keynote session titled: \" How we made the Jenkins community \"\n\nHere’s an excerpt from Kohsuke’s talk proposal:\n\nJenkins project has an interesting history. It started from scratch on my spare time, and grow over time to boast 600+ open-source plugins developed by 300+ contributors from all around the world.\n\nThere are several key ingredients, both technical and social, that enabled this model, and I think those ingredients are useful to other projects. In this talk, I’ll discuss how Jenkins project and the community works, what these ingredients are, why they help you attract more developers into your projects, and why it matters.\n\nYou can read more about Kohsuke’s keynote here\n\nIn addition to the keynote, I ( R. Tyler Croy), and a number of members of the Jenkins, Cucumber and Selenium communities are hosting the first ever Testing and Automation devroom at FOSDEM.\n\nIf you’re interested in submitting a talk proposal for the dev room the deadline is 23:59 UTC on December 21st 2012! The Call for Proposals can be found here, and the proposal submission form can can be found here.\n\nWe are very likely going to have a table in the hall again this year, but the FOSDEM committee hasn’t yet confirmed whether or not we will have a table.\n\nRegardless, a lot of Jenkins community members will be at FOSDEM in February in addition to hundreds of other open source contributors and users from around the world.\n\nIf you’re interested in participating and/or meeting up with the Jenkins crowd, there’s details coming together on the FOSDEM wiki page .\n\nWe hope to see you there!","title":"Jenkins keynote at FOSDEM 2013","tags":["general","cia","meetup","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
