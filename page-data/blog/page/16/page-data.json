then they can use the Maven plugin for generating the audit event classes for use in the plugin.\n\nThe other major feature of this plugin is configuring where to output these audit logs.\nBy default, audit logs will be written in HTML files (rotated once per day) to $JENKINS_HOME/logs/html/audit.html which are viewable through the \"Audit Logs\" root action link.\nIn the system settings, a section for audit logging is added where the main audit log output can be configured.\nThis can initially be configured to output via either a JSON log file in $JENKINS_HOME/logs/audit.log by default or to a syslog server using RFC5424 encoding.\n\nOverall, this experience has been rather interesting.\nBesides having an opportunity to mentor new contributors, Outreachy has helped open my eyes to the struggles that developers from around the world are dealing with which can be improved upon to help expand our communities.\nFor example, many countries do not have reliable internet or electricity, so the use of synchronous videoconferencing and other heavyweight, synchronous processes common to more corporate-style development are inadequate in this international context.\nThis doesn’t even begin to account for the difference in timezones which is not always an issue, though both problems are addressable by using asynchronous communication methods like chat and email.\nThis notion of asynchronous communication is an important aspect of the Apache Way, for example, which emphasises processes that allow for vendor neutral communities to form and thrive around a project.\n\nThis mentoring project was valuable to myself as well.\nAs a software engineer myself, project management is not my specialty, so this gave me a great opportunity to develop my own PM skills and technical leadership.\nMy own typical discovery process for feature development involves experimenting directly with the code to see what features make sense to prioritize and which would take a vast effort to implement.\nChanging my own discovery process to avoid implementing the features myself was difficult to adjust to, though I did defer any of my own feature contributions to this plugin until after the initial release.\nIn order to appropriately scope the project, I still had to spend a bit of time reading through the Jenkins codebase to determine which tasks could be implemented simply (e.g., good newbie-friendly issues), which tasks might require changes to Jenkins itself (previously discovered to take too long for these relatively short Outreachy rounds), and which tasks would require intimate familiarity with Jenkins and would likely be infeasible for new developers to Jenkins.\nThanks to the work done in discovery and delivery, I’ve also identified potential features for Log4j itself which could be used in future versions of this plugin.\n\nOverall, I think we did a good job of balancing the scope of this project without spending too much time in any specific area.\nThe first release of this plugin is now available in the Jenkins Update Center.\nIn the future, I hope to learn more about developing Jenkins UI components so that we can create a more dynamic and Jenkins-like configuration page for choosing where logs are output.\nWhile I don’t intend on using this plugin for further Outreachy rounds, I do hope to see more interest in it over time as the more security-conscious users out there discover this new plugin.","title":"Audit Log Plugin for Jenkins Releases 1.0","tags":["outreachy","logging","security","plugin","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"https://musigma.blog/","github":"jvz","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Mathematician, software engineer, and free software evangelist.\nWorks for CloudBees on the <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/security/\">Jenkins Security Team</a> along with other Jenkins community work since 2018.\nPMC Chair of the <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/\">Apache Logging Services project</a> and Secretary for the <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/\">Apache Software Foundation</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"jvz","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Matt Sicker","slug":"/blog/authors/jvz","twitter":"jvz"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d5e0f766-e02d-50ec-a790-2201ba4d74b9","slug":"/blog/2019/09/10/introducing-the-jira-software-plugin-for-jenkins/","strippedHtml":"According to a recent survey we conducted, software & IT teams on average use 4+ tools to move code from development to customer-facing production. As a result, teams struggle with keeping the status of work updated and understanding the overall health of their delivery pipeline.\n\nTo solve this problem, I am excited to announce that we built an official Jenkins plugin for Jira Software Cloud. The plugin automatically associates build and deployment information from Jenkins with relevant Jira issues and exposes key information about your pipeline across Jira issues, boards and via JQL. This means you can use Jira Software to automatically update and track issues through your complete development pipeline, from backlog to release.\n\nI hope this plugin adds value to you and your team. If you are interested in contributing or forking this plug-in you can head over to our project on the Jenkins GitHub repo to get started.\n\nBetter collaboration between teams\n\nThis new information view is so powerful because historically it was dispersed across multiple tools only accessible to a few members of your team. Now anyone involved in the software delivery process can self-serve this information. For example, product managers, QA, and support teams can view which features have been deployed to customers and which are still waiting in staging environments.\n\nWith better information sharing between tools in your delivery stack, you can also improve cross-collaboration between teams. Teams such as QA and operations can collaborate in the software teams next sprint. For example, you can use build information in Jira Software to create a workflow between QA and developers and create a rapid feedback loop for testing at any point in your development process.\n\nUse Jira’s Querying Language for advanced views\n\nIn addition to building better ways to collaborate, these integrations also give your team deeper insight into the development pipeline from within Jira Software. You can now create powerful views into your delivery pipeline with JQL queries across multiple connected tools. For example, you can write a custom JQL query to report all Jira issues that have been deployed to production but still have an open PR.\n\ndeploymentEnvironmentType ~ “production“ AND development[pullrequests].open\n\nGet started\n\nIn Jira Software Cloud\n\nCreate OAuth credentials in Jira for Jenkins\n\nNavigate to Jira home > Jira settings > Apps.\n\nSelect OAuth credentials.\n\nSelect Create credentials.\n\nEnter the following details:\n\nApp name - Jenkins\n\nApp logo - A URL to the Jenkins logo, which will be used as an icon in the list of credentials. Eg: https://jenkins.yourcompany.com/logo.png\n\nServer base URL - The URL to your Jenkins server. Eg: https://jenkins.yourcompany.com\n\nIn Jenkins\n\nInstall the Jenkins plugin\n\nLogin to your Jenkins server and navigate to the Plugin Manager.\n\nSelect the 'Available' tab and search for 'Atlassian Jira Software Cloud' as the plugin name then install it.\n\nThe open-source plugin is hosted in the Jenkins GitHub account. You can check it out here.\n\nSet up Jenkins credentials\n\nIn Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System screen and scroll to the Jira Software Cloud integration section.\n\nSelect Add Jira Cloud Site > Jira Cloud Site. The Site name, ClientID, and Secret fields display.\n\nEnter the following details:\n\nSite name: The URL for your Jira Cloud site, for example yourcompany.atlassian.net.\n\nClient ID: Copy from OAuth credentials screen (Client ID column).\n\nSecret: Select Add > Jenkins.\n\nFor Kind, select Secret text.\n\nFor Secret, copy from OAuth credentials screen (Secret column).\n\nFor Description, provide a helpful description\n\nSelect Test settings to make sure your credentials are valid for your Jira site.\n\nHow to use the plugin\n\nTo start using the integration:\n\nGo into a specific pipeline in Jenkins ( Note: Your pipeline must be a 'Multibranch Pipeline' ).\n\nFrom the left-hand menu, select Pipeline Syntax.\n\nIn the Snippet Generator, select jiraSendDeploymentInfo or jiraSendBuildInfo from the dropdown list of Sample Steps and fill in the relevant details.\n\nSelect Generate Pipeline Script and copy/paste the output into your Jenkinsfile on the relevant Repository you are using. This will be used to notify Jira when you run that pipeline on that repo.\n\nFor sending build information\n\nThis is an example snippet of a very simple ‘build’ stage set up in a Jenkinsfile. After the pipeline is run, it will post the build information to your Jira Cloud site by looking at the branch name. If there is a Jira issue key (e.g. “TEST-123”) in the branch name, it will send the data over to Jira.\n\nJenkinsfile example\n\npipeline {\n     agent any\n     stages {\n         stage('Build') {\n             steps {\n                 echo 'Building...'\n             }\n             post {\n                 always {\n                     jiraSendBuildInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net'\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n     }\n }\n\nFor sending deployment information\n\nThis is an example snippet of two stages that run on any change to the staging or master branch. Again, we use a post step to send deployment data to Jira and the relevant issues. Here, the environmentId, environmentName, and environmentType need to be set to whatever you want to appear in Jira.\n\nJenkinsfile example\n\npipeline {\n     agent any\n     stages {\n         stage('Deploy - Staging') {\n             when {\n                 branch 'master'\n             }\n             steps {\n                 echo 'Deploying to Staging from master...'\n             }\n             post {\n                 always {\n                     jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-stg-1', environmentName: 'us-stg-1', environmentType: 'staging'\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n         stage('Deploy - Production') {\n            when {\n                branch 'master'\n            }\n            steps {\n                echo 'Deploying to Production from master...'\n            }\n            post {\n                always {\n                    jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-prod-1', environmentName: 'us-prod-1', environmentType: 'production'\n                }\n            }\n         }\n     }\n }\n\nThe entire Jenkinsfile may look something like this. This is only meant to represent an example of what the Jira snippets could look like within a stage or step.\n\nJenkinsfile example\n\npipeline {\n     agent any\n     stages {\n         stage('Build') {\n             steps {\n                 echo 'Building...'\n             }\n             post {\n                 always {\n                     jiraSendBuildInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net'\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n         stage('Deploy - Staging') {\n             when {\n                 branch 'master'\n             }\n             steps {\n                 echo 'Deploying to Staging from master...'\n             }\n             post {\n                 always {\n                     jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-stg-1', environmentName: 'us-stg-1', environmentType: 'staging'\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n         stage('Deploy - Production') {\n            when {\n                branch 'master'\n            }\n            steps {\n                echo 'Deploying to Production from master...'\n            }\n            post {\n                always {\n                    jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-prod-1', environmentName: 'us-prod-1', environmentType: 'production'\n                }\n            }\n         }\n     }\n }\n\nQuestions or feedback?\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact Atlassian support and they will route it to the correct team to help you.","title":"Introducing the Jira Software plugin for Jenkins","tags":["jira","plugin","pipeline"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"rafalmyslek","html":"","id":"rafalmyslek","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rafal Myslek","slug":"/blog/authors/rafalmyslek","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ddc369d5-a5e4-57f5-8fb7-5ebe49126b06","slug":"/blog/2019/08/30/jenkins-cli/","strippedHtml":"As a developer, I usually use Jenkins like this:\n\nFind a job which is related with my current work\n\nTrigger that job\n\nCheck the output of the build log\n\nSometimes, I might need to check the update center. Maybe a new plugin is needed, or I need to update an existing plugin.\nOr, I want to upload a plugin from my computer. For all these cases, I just don’t need a UI or even a browser.\nI like to use a CLI to complete most of my tasks. For example, I use kubectl to manage my Kubernetes cluster,\nto create or modify the kubernetes resources. So, I start to think, 'Why not use a CLI to manage my Jenkins?'.\n\nWhy create a new one?\n\nFirst, I almost forgot about the existing Jenkins CLI, written in Java. Let me introduce how to use that one.\n\nVisit Jenkins page from http://localhost:8080/jenkins/cli/ . You’ll see a command like java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/jenkins/ help. So, a jar file needs to be download.\nWe can use this command to complete this task wget http://localhost:8080/jenkins/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar .\n\nNow you can see that this is not a Linux-style CLI. Please consider some points below:\n\nThe users must have a JRE. This is not convenient for developers who don’t use Java.\n\nThe CLI is too wordy. We always need to type java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/jenkins/ as the initial command.\n\nCannot install it by some popular package manager, like brew or yum.\n\nOf course, the Java CLI client is more native with Jenkins. But I’d like to use this more easily.\nSo I decided to create a new CLI tool which would be written in Go and which would natively run on modern platforms.\n\nThat’s the story of creating jcli.\n\nFeatures\n\nEasy to maintain config file for jcli\n\nMultiple Jenkins support\n\nPlugins management (list, search, install, upload)\n\nJob management (search, build, log)\n\nOpen your Jenkins with a browser\n\nRestart your Jenkins\n\nConnection with proxy support\n\nHow to get it?\n\nYou can clone jcli from the jenkins-cli repo. For now, we support\nthese three most popular OS platforms: MacOS, Linux, and Windows.\n\nMacOS\n\nYou can use brew to install jcli.\n\nbrew tap jenkins-zh/jcli\nbrew install jcli\n\nLinux\n\nIt’s very simple to install jcli into your Linux OS. Just need to execute a command line at below:\n\ncurl -L https://github.com/jenkins-zh/jenkins-cli/releases/latest/download/jcli-linux-amd64.tar.gz|tar xzv\nsudo mv jcli /usr/local/bin/\n\nWindows\n\nYou can find the latest version by clicking here. Then download the tar file, cp the uncompressed jcli directory into your system path.\n\nHow to get started?\n\nIt’s very simple to use this. Once you get jcli on your computer, use this command to generate a sample configuration:\n\n$ jcli config generate\ncurrent: yourServer\njenkins_servers:\n- name: yourServer\n  url: http://localhost:8080/jenkins\n  username: admin\n  token: 111e3a2f0231198855dceaff96f20540a9\n  proxy: \"\"\n  proxyAuth: \"\"\n# Goto 'http://localhost:8080/jenkins/me/configure', then you can generate your token.\n\nIn most cases, you should modify three fields which are url, username and token. OK, I believe you’re ready. Please check whether you install the github plugin in your Jenkins:\n\njcli plugin list --filter name=github\n\nThat’s the end. It’s still in very early development stage.

The performance issues for Role Strategy Plugin\nhad been reported multiple times on Jenkins JIRA. With a large number of roles\nand with complex regular expressions, a large slow-down was visible on the Web UI.\nEven before GSoC started, there were a number of patches which tried to improve\nperformance of the plugin (by Deepansh Nagaria\nand others).\n\nAt the time, there was no way to reliably measure improvements in performance.\nTherefore, we started by creating a\nframework\nfor running micro-benchmarks on Jenkins Plugins. Benchmarks using the framework\nwere added to the Role Strategy Plugin find performance\ncritical parts of the plugins and to measure the improvements of a change.\nThis blog post summarizes the changes that were made and performance improvements\nmeasured.\n\nCaching matching roles\n\nA couple of major changes were made to the Role Strategy Plugin to improve its\nperformance. First, we started collection of roles that matched a given\nproject name. The Role Strategy plugin before version 2.12 used to run over\nregular expressions for every role that it had for every permission checking\nrequest it got. Storing this produced set of roles in the memory provides us\nlarge improvements in performance and avoids repeated matching of project names\nwith regular expressions. For keeping the plugin working securely, we invalidate\nthe cache whenever any update is made to the roles.\n\nAfter this change, we were able to observe performance improvements of up to\n3300%. These improvements were visualized using\nJMH Visualizer.\n\nMore information is available at pull request on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/pull/81\n\nCalculating Implying Permisions when plugin is loaded\n\nJenkins' permission model allows one permissions to imply other permissions.\nWhen a permission check is made, we need to check if the user has any of\npermissions that would imply this permisison. For every permission checking\nrequest that that the Role Strategy, it used to calculate all the implying\npermissions. To avoid this, we now calculate and store implying permissions\nfor every permission in the Jenkins system when the plugin gets loaded.\n\nAfter both of these changes, we were able to experience improvements of up to\n10000%. The benchmark results show it better:\n\nMore information about this change can be found at the GitHub pull request:\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/pull/83\n\nBoth of these changes were integrated into the Role Strategy Plugin and the\nimprovements can be experienced starting with version\n2.13.\n\nBonus: Configuration-as-Code export now works for Role Strategy\n\nWith Configuration-as-Code plugin version\n1.24\nand above, export of your configuration as YAML now works!\n\nAs an alternative to\nRole Strategy Plugin, I also created the brand new Folder Authorization Plugin.\nYou can check out the blog post for\nmore information about the plugin.\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nI would love to hear your comments and suggestions. Please feel free to reach\nout to me through either the\nRole Strategy Plugin Gitter chat or through\nJenkins Developer Mailing list.\n\nPresentation slides for final evaluation of GSoC\n\nThe Folder Authorization Plugin\n\nDemo for the final evaluations","title":"Performance Improvements to Role Strategy Plugin","tags":["plugins","security","performance","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/ff5b9/abhyudayasharma.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/f4523/abhyudayasharma.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/1e7bb/abhyudayasharma.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/ff5b9/abhyudayasharma.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/b48b6/abhyudayasharma.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/1fd06/abhyudayasharma.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/9edd6/abhyudayasharma.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/f5f75/abhyudayasharma.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/05d06/abhyudayasharma.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":142}}},"blog":null,"github":"AbhyudayaSharma","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Abhyudaya is a Computer Science student at Shiv Nadar University, India.\nHe is participating in Google Summer of Code 2019 to improve the performance\nof the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin\">Role Strategy Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"abhyudayasharma","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Abhyudaya Sharma","slug":"/blog/authors/abhyudayasharma","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d12bee04-3e3b-5a23-9775-d800d9abf794","slug":"/blog/2019/08/25/jenkinsworld-contrib-summit-ask-the-expert-booth/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins turns 15 years old!\nJenkins World brings together DevOps thought leaders, IT executives, continuous delivery practitioners and the Jenkins\ncommunity and ecosystem in one global event, providing attendees with the opportunity to learn, explore, network\nface-to-face and help shape the next evolution of Jenkins development and solutions for DevOps.\n\nThere is also the Jenkins Contributor Summit in San Francisco.

This was a chance for everyone to get together and talk about\ncontributions and put faces to names. Most people I had only met via video chat or on gitter so I was super excited.\nWe gathered to hear about the start of the Jenkins open source landscape.\n\nNext up was the BoF/Unconference. I was leading these sessions and I felt they went really well.\nWe had fellow org admins Martin d’Anjou and Jeff Pearce give a talk about Google Summer of Code projects.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code student Natasha Stopa presented her project, Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool. This is\na super cool project and very well received in the community.\n\nWe closed out the session with a presentation from Steven Terrana from Booz Allen Hamilton and the awesome Jenkins\nTemplating Engine.

There is a lot of marketing data regarding the increased usage of\nKubernetes but I was seriously surprised by the massive interest in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nOf course there were opportunities for selfie requests.\n\nLunch time demos got underway and we had a busy schedule.\nFirst up was the awesome Mark Waite to talk about the\nGit plugin. A lot of people use git in\nJenkins.\nThank you so much for all that you do Mark.\n\nJenkins org admin Martin d’Anjou was next on deck to talk about the Google Summer of Code. So amazing to think that the\nGoogle Summer of Code is also in its 15th year like Jenkins!\n\nNatasha Stopa is a Google Summer of Code student and she presented her project Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool.\nNatasha really put a lot of hard work in to this plugin and it was really awesome to see the turn out and support during\nher presentation.\n\nFinally there was me. I presented the Sysdig Secure Scanning Jenkins plugin which I am a maintainer of. I thank everyone who attended\n\nRight after the lunch time demos I also oversaw the Jenkins open space. This was an opportunity for the community to talk\nabout items and let them flow organically. I really enjoyed this session and felt it was also well received.\n\nWe closed out the day and the event with a picture of some of the Jenkins org admins and Google Summer of Code students.\nMissing from this photos are fellow org admins, Lloyd Chang and Oleg Nenashev\n\nClosing\n\nThis was an amazing experience.

The Working Hours Plugin repository can be found at Working Hours Plugin.\n\nOverview\n\nDeveloping plugin for Jenkins has always been easy to do with its Jelly based UI render system, but Jelly seems to be pretty heavy when we want to use more modernized frameworks like React, or if we need to make the plugin UI more customized. This is what this template is built for.\n\nAnd with React integrated, development of Jenkins plugin is more modernized, developer can now use tons of React libraries, the way to use libraries is now tinier and safer with webpack, in short, coding with Jenkins plugin can be much easier.\n\nFeatures\n\nFeature\nSummary\n\nReact Integrated\nReact is integrated, you can take full control of the UI\n\nUsing Iframe\nUsing iframe can create a new javascript env, we can get rid of some side effects of some polyfills which was added globally.(such as Prototype.js)\n\nMaven Lifecycle\nnpm commands are integrated into Maven lifecycle with help of Frontend Maven Plugin\n\nWebpack\nWebpack helps us reduce the size of the bundle, also avoids pollution on the global namespace.\n\nJenkins Crumb attached\nCrumb is attached to Axios client, now you can send requests in the way you used to do in React.\n\nExpress as devserver\nYou can run your react app in a standalone page so you can develop in webpack hot reload mode, also with webpack proxy, the standalone app is still accessible to the jenkins dev server.\n\nAxios as http client\nAxios hugely simplify the way to make requests.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExample Plugin UI\n\nManagement Link\n\nGetting Started\n\nClone the repo:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/react-plugin-template.git\ncd react-plugin-template\n\nInstall the Maven dependencies and node modules.\n\nmvn install -DskipTests\n\nRun standalone React app with hot reload\n\nnpm run start\n\nRun plugin\n\nmvn hpi:run -Dskip.npm -f pom.xml\n\nSend HTTP requests\n\nAs Crumb Issuer is default enabled in Jenkins and each ajax request is required to contain a Jenkins Crumb in request header, so be sure to use the axiosInstance which is already set up with Jenkins Crumb and exported at src/main/react/app/api.js.\n\nexport const apiGetData = () => {\n  return axiosInstance.post(\"/data\");\n};\n\nOr if you want to use your own http client, remember to add the Jenkins Crumb to your request’s header, the Crumb’s key and content could be found at src/main/react/app/utils/urlConfig.js, then you can set the header like below.\n\nconst headers = {};\nconst crumbHeaderName = UrlConfig.getCrumbHeaderName();\n\nif (crumbHeaderName) {\n  headers[crumbHeaderName] = UrlConfig.getCrumbToken();\n}\n\nWrite your own request handler\n\nNow you can customize your request pattern as you want, also we need to write a handler.\n\nJenkins is using stapler to preprocess the requests, so if you need a request handler. For example and also in this template, you can use an Action class to create a sub-url, and then a StaplerProxy to proxy the request like a router. More info about handlers can be found in the Stapler Reference.\n\nExample handler\n\nManagementLink would get the request and then hand it off to the PluginUI\n\n@Extension\npublic class PluginManagementLink extends ManagementLink implements StaplerProxy {\n\n    PluginUI webapp;\n\n    public Object getTarget() {\n        return webapp;\n    }\n\n    public String getUrlName() {\n        return \"react-plugin-template\";\n    }\n}\n\nPluginUI, stapler would then find methods in the target class, in this case, it finds doDynamic, then we can choose the next handler by return the methods result, in this case, getTodos or setTodos, and PluginUI just function like a url router.\n\npublic class PluginUI{\n    public HttpResponse doDynamic(StaplerRequest request) {\n        ...\n\n        List params = getRequestParams(request);\n\n        switch (params.get(0)) {\n        case \"get-todos\":\n            return getTodos();\n        case \"set-todos\":\n            return setTodos(request);\n        }\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nData Persistence\n\nYou can save your data with a descriptor\n\n@Extension\npublic class PluginConfig extends Descriptor implements Describable\n\nAnd after each time you change data, call save() to persist them.\n\npublic void setTodos(\n            @CheckForNull List value) {\n        this.todos = value;\n        save();\n    }\n\nAnd in your handler, you can get the config class by calling\n\nconfig = ExtensionList.lookup(PluginConfig.class).get(0);\n\nCustomize your plugin\n\nBe sure to modify all the occurrence of react-template\n\nAt org/jenkinsci/plugins/reactplugintemplate/PluginUI/index.jelly, change the iframe’s id and its source url.\n\nAt src/main/react/app/utils/urlConfig.js change\n\nAt src/main/react/server/config.js, change the proxy route.\n\nAt src/main/react/package.json, change the start script’s BASE_URL\n\nAt pom.xml, change the artifactId\n\nAt org/jenkinsci/plugins/reactplugintemplate/PluginManagementLink.java, change names.\n\nAlso use the same value to modify the occurrence in src\\main\\react\\app\\utils\\urlConfig.js.\n\nCustomize a page for your plugin\n\nA management Link is recommended, which would get your plugin a standalone page, along with a entry button in the /manage system manage page.\n\nHow does this template work?\n\nThis template is putting a webpack project inside a Maven project, and this template is just chaining the build result by copy the webpack output to the plugin’s webapp folder to make it accessible from the iframe, then Jelly render the iframe and the client gets the Plugin UI.\n\nWhy iframe?\n\nOver time, Jenkins has added a lot of various javascript libraries to every regular page, which now causes problems for using modern Javascript tooling and as such, we decided to inline the new react based pages in their own sandbox which prevents collisions with other libraries, and maybe the iframe is a good sandbox case.\n\nLinks\n\nGithub: React Plugin Template\n\nGithub: Working Hours Plugin","title":"Introduce React Plugin Template","tags":["react","plugins","template","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/77b35/jackshen.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/d4a57/jackshen.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/14734/jackshen.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ef6ff/jackshen.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/8257c/jackshen.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/f4bd7/jackshen.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/65cd2/jackshen.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":129}}},"blog":null,"github":"ShenJack","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Shen is a student from Beijing Forestry University.
