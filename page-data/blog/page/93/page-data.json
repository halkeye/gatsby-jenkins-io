What puts Hudson in a league of its own compared to others is its ability to execute arbitrary commands on agent machines, or in the case of the EC2 plugin, execute arbitrary commands \"in the cloud.\" In light of all this, Hudson is quite secure and offers a variety of mechanisms to reduce the potential for exploits.\n\nDespite Hudson’s security track record, you’ve managed to find a vulnerability in Hudson, and decide to don your white hat and inform the Hudson team. First off, let me commend you on your brilliant decision to report the vulnerability, you are truly a leader among men.\n\nGenerally immediate public disclosure of vulnerabilities is frowned upon as it doesn’t give us much time to react, investigate and patch the hole. For this reason there is the \" SECURITY\" project in Hudson’s JIRA. The SECURITY project is a more locked down section of JIRA than the other projects and allows you to submit issues and have them reviewed by the Hudson core developers who can assess the vulnerability. When reporting the issue, it will be helpful to include information regarding the environment the Hudson instance is running in (such as the servlet container) as well as any pertinent reproduction steps so the team can reproduce, fix and verify with as little wheel-spinning as possible.\n\nWhat happens next wholly determines on the severity of the issue, if it’s a highly critical vulnerability, the team will likely make an out-of-schedule release and advise users to upgrade. If it’s a less critical hole, the fix will be included in an upcoming scheduled release. Either way, the Hudson team has a good track record of correct potential security holes in a timely fashion.\n\nAfter the hole you’ve discovered has been patched and released, you can revel in the fact that you helped make Hudson better, thanks!\n\nImage courtesy of ThinkGeek","title":"So you've found a vulnerability, now what?","tags":["general","core","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

If you live outside of the U.S., or if you requested more than 50-ish stickers, I’ve not yet been able to send you stickers. I expect to start sending out international shipments later this week and early next week.\nTo those of you that have received your stickers, I’d like to remind you of the terms of our agreement:\n\nConferences : The only condition being that you tell me all about the event and how Hudson was received after the fact (this may involve an interview).\n\nCompanies : I always appreciate stickers, pens, branded bouncy balls, etc (see: swag) in return!\n\nNice People : If you’re just a fan of Hudson, stickers, or both, I’ll still gladly mail you a few stickers with the condition that you take pictures of where the stickers end up (and maybe of your Hudson install) and either email me some cool pictures or post them to  Flickr (tagged: \"hudsonstickers\")\n\nTo be honest, I really just want to see some pictures of Hudson stickers slapped all over cool stuff: laptops, bosses, servers, desks, stop signs, coworkers, cats, you name it.\n\nIf you did not request stickers, but want some now: please refer to the original post for directions.

Along with the usual bunch of fixes, this release includes a number of localization updates courtesy of a team of Hudson community volunteers participating in the Hudson Internationalization project.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this post is being published on Tuesday, contrary to the schedule that I operated on with Continuous Blog, I will no longer be posting release updates on Monday morning. Traditionally Hudson is released Friday afternoon (PST), meaning any potential regressions are reported early on Monday morning after our European users start to upgrade. Publishing this release announcement on Tuesday gives me more time to test out the release so I can report with greater confidence in the reliability of the update. ( Note : This may change in the future as we push for easier RC testing capabilities within Hudson)\n\nIf you’re a regular reader of the Hudson Labs blog, you may also notice that this change log looks eerily similar to the 1.362 announcement from last week. Turns out I had mistakenly taken the upcoming changes from 1.363 and reported them as fixes in 1.362; I’ve since updated the post regarding 1.362’s change log.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nFix queue handling to close locking gap between removing job from queue and starting build, to prevent unintended concurrent builds (refactor of change first made in 1.360). ( report)\n\nAllow multiple dependencies between same two projects, as they may trigger under different conditions and with different parameters. ( issue 5708)\n\nTimeline on build trend page should use server timezone instead of always GMT. ( issue 6692)\n\nDon’t mask the cause of the checkout related exception.\n\n\"who am I?\" page should be visible to everyone.\n\nReinstall a JDK when a different version is selected.

In fact, this is often considered central to the practice of continuous integration.\n\nThere are two ways to achieve this. One is the \"pull\" model, where Hudson periodically reaches out to a Subversion repository to see if there is any changes. The other is the \"push\" model, where you make the Subversion repository reach out to Hudson.\n\nBoth approaches have trade-offs. The pull model is easier to configure, since you can do this entirely from Hudson. But this comes at the expense of increased load to the Subversion server. Even though the overhead of Subversion polling is relatively low, as you add more projects to Hudson and increase the polling frequency, the overhead may get non-trivial (imagine the number of Hudson pollings that the poor java.net Subversion server gets, for example.) A more serious downside, in my opinion, is that this increases the delay from your commit to a build. For example, if your build just takes 5 mins, then even if you poll every minute, you pay on average 30 seconds delay before a build starts — a 10% overhead!\n\nThe push approach eliminates those two downsides, but it requires a post-commit hook configuration in the Subversion repository, which has to be done manually by the administrator, because those scripts are not exposed to external systems like Hudson.\n\nWith that said, if you do have an access to the Subversion repository post-commit hook, I highly recommend the push approach, and in Hudson we made it as easy as possible to configure the set up. Here’s the script you’ll need in your post-commit hook:\n\nREPOS=\"$1\" REV=\"$2\" UUID=\\`svnlook uuid $REPOS\\` /usr/bin/wget \\\n       --header \"Content-Type:text/plain;charset=UTF-8\" \\\n       --post-data \"\\`svnlook changed --revision $REV $REPOS\\`\" \\\n       --output-document \"-\" \\\n       https://server/hudson/subversion/${UUID}/notifyCommit?rev=$REV\n\nThis script basically just tells Hudson that there was a change in a repository. Hudson will then check this information against all the jobs that have a polling configured, and schedule the builds accordingly. The beauty of this approach is two-folds:\n\nThe script doesn’t change when you add/remove/rename jobs.\n\nThe overhead is constant regardless of the number of jobs.\n\nIf you haven’t configured a push setup yet, now is the time to do so!","title":"Subversion repository change notification: push vs pull","tags":["general","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":736,"numPages":100,"currentPage":93}},
