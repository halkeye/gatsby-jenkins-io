Thanks to a huge amuont of help by my future wife, the first shipment of Hudson stickers went into the mail last week. This first shipment was only to United States addresses! If you live outside of the U.S., or if you requested more than 50-ish stickers, I’ve not yet been able to send you stickers. I expect to start sending out international shipments later this week and early next week.\nTo those of you that have received your stickers, I’d like to remind you of the terms of our agreement:\n\nConferences : The only condition being that you tell me all about the event and how Hudson was received after the fact (this may involve an interview).\n\nCompanies : I always appreciate stickers, pens, branded bouncy balls, etc (see: swag) in return!\n\nNice People : If you’re just a fan of Hudson, stickers, or both, I’ll still gladly mail you a few stickers with the condition that you take pictures of where the stickers end up (and maybe of your Hudson install) and either email me some cool pictures or post them to  Flickr (tagged: \"hudsonstickers\")\n\nTo be honest, I really just want to see some pictures of Hudson stickers slapped all over cool stuff: laptops, bosses, servers, desks, stop signs, coworkers, cats, you name it.\n\nIf you did not request stickers, but want some now: please refer to the original post for directions. I do still have stickers left, but there are some \"bulk requests\" I’ve not yet filled.

Traditionally Hudson is released Friday afternoon (PST), meaning any potential regressions are reported early on Monday morning after our European users start to upgrade. Publishing this release announcement on Tuesday gives me more time to test out the release so I can report with greater confidence in the reliability of the update. ( Note : This may change in the future as we push for easier RC testing capabilities within Hudson)\n\nIf you’re a regular reader of the Hudson Labs blog, you may also notice that this change log looks eerily similar to the 1.362 announcement from last week. Turns out I had mistakenly taken the upcoming changes from 1.363 and reported them as fixes in 1.362; I’ve since updated the post regarding 1.362’s change log.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nFix queue handling to close locking gap between removing job from queue and starting build, to prevent unintended concurrent builds (refactor of change first made in 1.360). ( report)\n\nAllow multiple dependencies between same two projects, as they may trigger under different conditions and with different parameters.

In fact, this is often considered central to the practice of continuous integration.\n\nThere are two ways to achieve this. One is the \"pull\" model, where Hudson periodically reaches out to a Subversion repository to see if there is any changes. The other is the \"push\" model, where you make the Subversion repository reach out to Hudson.\n\nBoth approaches have trade-offs. The pull model is easier to configure, since you can do this entirely from Hudson. But this comes at the expense of increased load to the Subversion server. Even though the overhead of Subversion polling is relatively low, as you add more projects to Hudson and increase the polling frequency, the overhead may get non-trivial (imagine the number of Hudson pollings that the poor java.net Subversion server gets, for example.) A more serious downside, in my opinion, is that this increases the delay from your commit to a build. For example, if your build just takes 5 mins, then even if you poll every minute, you pay on average 30 seconds delay before a build starts — a 10% overhead!\n\nThe push approach eliminates those two downsides, but it requires a post-commit hook configuration in the Subversion repository, which has to be done manually by the administrator, because those scripts are not exposed to external systems like Hudson.\n\nWith that said, if you do have an access to the Subversion repository post-commit hook, I highly recommend the push approach, and in Hudson we made it as easy as possible to configure the set up. Here’s the script you’ll need in your post-commit hook:\n\nREPOS=\"$1\" REV=\"$2\" UUID=\\`svnlook uuid $REPOS\\` /usr/bin/wget \\\n       --header \"Content-Type:text/plain;charset=UTF-8\" \\\n       --post-data \"\\`svnlook changed --revision $REV $REPOS\\`\" \\\n       --output-document \"-\" \\\n       https://server/hudson/subversion/${UUID}/notifyCommit?rev=$REV\n\nThis script basically just tells Hudson that there was a change in a repository. Hudson will then check this information against all the jobs that have a polling configured, and schedule the builds accordingly. The beauty of this approach is two-folds:\n\nThe script doesn’t change when you add/remove/rename jobs.\n\nThe overhead is constant regardless of the number of jobs.\n\nIf you haven’t configured a push setup yet, now is the time to do so!","title":"Subversion repository change notification: push vs pull","tags":["general","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ba641f0e-00e7-583a-ae6c-7b96cc13d8f6","slug":"/blog/2010/06/09/welcome-to-hudson-labs/","strippedHtml":"Hello again! It’s been a long time since I’ve written for the Hudson community, but now I’m back and ready to tackle some of the latest developments in the Hudson community.\n\nWhat is Hudson Labs?\n\nAs you may have read in April, Kohsuke left Oracle to found InfraDNA, a company specializing around Hudson. The departure meant the Hudson community would no longer have access to some of the hardware and services that Kohsuke had accumulated over the years working on Hudson at Sun Microsystems. While we are still happily part of the Java.net community, we’ve recognized the need for some community-owned resources and Hudson Labs was born.\n\nOver the past couple months, a group within the Hudson community, \"infra\" (short for \"infrastructure\"), has been working to get machines set up and build the foundation for a more open Hudson project infrastructure.\n\nWhat does Hudson Labs provide?\nBuilds\n\nOne of the first tasks we set upon when building out Hudson Labs was to start improving the build and release process of Hudson by moving as much of it into a public Hudson instance. Building Hudson itself, plugins and dependencies of the Hudson project, the Hudson Labs instance will help improve the reliability of the Hudson ecosystem across the board, and should serve as a useful tool for core and plugin developers.\n\nMirroring\n\nThanks to the great team over at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab ( OSUOSL), we’ve been able to build out mirroring infrastructure for Hudson to provide fast access to native packages and wars alike. Currently the OSUOSL only has mirrors inside the continental United States, so we’re reaching out to friends in Asia and Europe to extend the mirroring system.\n\nInformation\n\nI’m currently working on re-working some of the blog posts you may have read over four months as more structured tutorials. I hope to provide an easily accessible knowledge-base for developing Hudson along with configuring Hudson for various platforms and development environments; this is a more difficult task so all the pieces aren’t entirely in place for this just yet.\n\nTo be honest, I’m very enthusiastic about Hudson’s future. Now that InfraDNA is up and running, Kohsuke’s renewed focus combined with the foundation of Hudson Labs and the uncommonly hospitable Hudson developer and user communities, the future is looking bright!","title":"Welcome to Hudson Labs!","tags":["general","meta","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Of course, the work never stops on Hudson so we almost have 1.356 ready to roll out the door, but then Kohsuke tweeted this:\n\nBecause of the data center migration going on, I won’t be able to release #hudsonci today.\n\nI won’t go into details on some of the infrastructure changes we have lined up just yet, so here’s the breakdown of 1.355\n\nBugs fixed\n\nColored ball image at top of build pages was broken for Hudson in some web containers (fixed by removing workaround for a Firefox bug fixed since 3.0.5/Dec2008). ( issue 2341)\n\nConsole page while build is running did not wrap lines when viewed in IE. ( issue 5869)\n\nFixed build history to indicate test failure for MavenBuild and MavenModuleSetBuild.\n\nMake dropdownList work in repeatable content, such as a build step.\n\nEnhancements\n\nAdded the agent retention strategy based on a schedule.\n\nAdded to configure charset option of Mailer.\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.355 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links","releases"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
