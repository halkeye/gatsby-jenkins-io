Partially thanks to ( Titus Brown)'s PyCon 2010 Atlanta coverage of continuous integration for Python (which we’ve covered before), Hudson has made great strides within the Python community as well. In my experience, the majority of Python developers are not using Hudson to build anything, unless they have C extensions, but rather to test their packages, which presents its own set of specific requirements for jobs. Jobs for testing Python code need to be able to reliaby reproduce an environment with the same set of dependencies from one run to the next in order to provide consistent testing. Unlike their Java counterparts, Python developers cannot rely on a powerful system like Maven2 for enumerating build/test targets or defining their project’s dependencies in their jobs; fortunately, w e can have something close: virtualenv and pip. Virtualenv does exactly what you might expect it to, it creates a \"virtual environment\" with custom site-packages directory, and modified python executable. Using virtualenv you can create a staged environment to use for running unit and integration tests. Adding pip alongside that and you have a fantastic Python package manager/installer to use with the virtual environment. Below, I’ve outlined the steps required to use virtualenv and pip to automatically manage a custom environment for your Python jobs.\n\nThe Recipe\n\nFor this recipe to work, you should make sure that your agent machines all have virtualenv and pip installed and accessible from your agent agent’s $PATH. For Mac OS X users, sudo easy_install virtualenv should do the trick, Linux users should be able to run sudo [aptitude/yum/zypper] install python-virtualenv with your respective package manager. You will also need the SetEnv Plugin installed in Hudson.\n\nStep 1\n\nInside of the job’s configuration page ( http;//hudson/job/configure), we need to define an environment variable for the job. Using the SetEnv plugin, define a new $PATH : `PATH=.env/bin:$PATH\n\nWhat this will do is modify the $PATH environment variable for all of the \"Execute shell\" build steps in your job. As you might have guessed, we’re going to install the virtualenv in.env in the workspace root directory.\n\nStep 2\n\nTo set up the virtualenv, you want to add a build step of type \"Execute shell\" and paste the following commands into the text area:\n\nif [ -d \".env\" ]; then\n  echo \"**> virtualenv exists\"\nelse\n  echo \"**> creating virtualenv\"\n  virtualenv .env\nfi\n\nThis will create a virtualenv the first time the job runs on a particular agent, a virtualenv that will persist until the workspace is cleared. Since we’re going to install dependencies in the virtualenv, we want to keep it around between jobs to reduce the amount of network hits to download packages.\n\nStep 3\n\nWith our virtualenv and our $PATH properly set up, the job can now properly install dependencies into its virtualenv, this is where pip shines. A little known feature of pip allows you to define a \"requirements file\" which enumerates the packages to install. In my example project, I defined the following requirements in a file called pip-requires.txt\n\neventlet>=0.9.9\nnose>=0.11.3\nMySQL-python>=1.2.3c1\n\nIn my hypothetical example, I’ll need nose to run my tests, while eventlet and MySQL-python are required for my project to properly run. With the pip-requires.txt file in the root of my source repository, I can add an additional \"Execute shell\" build step that does the following:\n\npip install -r pip-requires.txt\n\nAssuming the $PATH environment variable was properly defined, this will use the virtualenv’s version of pip and it will install the packages defined in pip-requires.txt into the virtualenv! With the dependencies all properly installed in the virtualenv, I can now configure the remainder of my job to build my project and execute the tests. Pretty snazzy if you ask me!","title":"A Python Love Story: Virtualenv and Hudson","tags":["general","guest post","tutorial"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

What puts Hudson in a league of its own compared to others is its ability to execute arbitrary commands on agent machines, or in the case of the EC2 plugin, execute arbitrary commands \"in the cloud.\" In light of all this, Hudson is quite secure and offers a variety of mechanisms to reduce the potential for exploits.\n\nDespite Hudson’s security track record, you’ve managed to find a vulnerability in Hudson, and decide to don your white hat and inform the Hudson team. First off, let me commend you on your brilliant decision to report the vulnerability, you are truly a leader among men.\n\nGenerally immediate public disclosure of vulnerabilities is frowned upon as it doesn’t give us much time to react, investigate and patch the hole. For this reason there is the \" SECURITY\" project in Hudson’s JIRA. The SECURITY project is a more locked down section of JIRA than the other projects and allows you to submit issues and have them reviewed by the Hudson core developers who can assess the vulnerability. When reporting the issue, it will be helpful to include information regarding the environment the Hudson instance is running in (such as the servlet container) as well as any pertinent reproduction steps so the team can reproduce, fix and verify with as little wheel-spinning as possible.\n\nWhat happens next wholly determines on the severity of the issue, if it’s a highly critical vulnerability, the team will likely make an out-of-schedule release and advise users to upgrade. If it’s a less critical hole, the fix will be included in an upcoming scheduled release. Either way, the Hudson team has a good track record of correct potential security holes in a timely fashion.\n\nAfter the hole you’ve discovered has been patched and released, you can revel in the fact that you helped make Hudson better, thanks!\n\nImage courtesy of ThinkGeek","title":"So you've found a vulnerability, now what?","tags":["general","core","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
