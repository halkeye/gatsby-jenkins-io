Instead you would like to define something like a pipeline\n\"template\" that can be applied easily to all of your services.\n\nThe requirement for a common pipeline that can be used in multiple projects does not only emerge in microservice architectures. It’s valid for all areas where applications are\nbuilt on a similar technology stack or deployed in a standardized way (e.g. pre-packages as containers).\n\nIn this blog post I’d like to outline the possibility to create such a pipeline \"template\" using Jenkins Shared Libraries. If\nyou’re not yet familiar with Shared Libraries I’d recommend having a look at\nthe documentation.\n\nThe following code shows a (simplified) integration and delivery Pipeline for a\nSpring Boot application in declarative syntax.\n\nJenkinsFile\n\npipeline {\n    agent any\n    environment {\n        branch = 'master'\n        scmUrl = 'ssh://git@myScmServer.com/repos/myRepo.git'\n        serverPort = '8080'\n        developmentServer = 'dev-myproject.mycompany.com'\n        stagingServer = 'staging-myproject.mycompany.com'\n        productionServer = 'production-myproject.mycompany.com'\n    }\n    stages {\n        stage('checkout git') {\n            steps {\n                git branch: branch, credentialsId: 'GitCredentials', url: scmUrl\n            }\n        }\n\n        stage('build') {\n            steps {\n                sh 'mvn clean package -DskipTests=true'\n            }\n        }\n\n        stage ('test') {\n            steps {\n                parallel (\n                    \"unit tests\": { sh 'mvn test' },\n                    \"integration tests\": { sh 'mvn integration-test' }\n                )\n            }\n        }\n\n        stage('deploy development'){\n            steps {\n                deploy(developmentServer, serverPort)\n            }\n        }\n\n        stage('deploy staging'){\n            steps {\n                deploy(stagingServer, serverPort)\n            }\n        }\n\n        stage('deploy production'){\n            steps {\n                deploy(productionServer, serverPort)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    post {\n        failure {\n            mail to: 'team@example.com', subject: 'Pipeline failed', body: \"${env.BUILD_URL}\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis Pipeline builds the application, runs unit as well as integration tests and deploys the application to\nseveral environments. It uses a global variable \"deploy\" that is provided within a Shared Library. The deploy method\ncopies the JAR-File to a remote server and starts the application. Through the handy REST endpoints of Spring Boot\nActuator a previous version of the application is stopped beforehand. Afterwards the deployment is verified via the\nhealth status monitor of the application.\n\nvars/deploy.groovy\n\ndef call(def server, def port) {\n    httpRequest httpMode: 'POST', url: \"http://${server}:${port}/shutdown\", validResponseCodes: '200,408'\n    sshagent(['RemoteCredentials']) {\n        sh \"scp target/*.jar root@${server}:/opt/jenkins-demo.jar\"\n        sh \"ssh root@${server} nohup java -Dserver.port=${port} -jar /opt/jenkins-demo.jar &\"\n    }\n    retry (3) {\n        sleep 5\n        httpRequest url:\"http://${server}:${port}/health\", validResponseCodes: '200', validResponseContent: '\"status\":\"UP\"'\n    }\n}\n\nThe common approach to reuse pipeline code is to put methods like \"deploy\" into\na Shared Library. If we now start developing the next application of the same\nfashion we can use this method for deployments as well. But often there are\neven more similarities within projects of one company. E.g. applications are\nbuilt, tested and deployed in the same way into the same environments\n(development, staging and production). In this case it is possible to define\nthe whole Pipeline as a global variable within a Shared Library. The next code\nsnippet defines a Pipeline \"template\" for all of our Spring Boot applications.\n\nvars/myDeliveryPipeline.groovy\n\ndef call(Map pipelineParams) {\n\n    pipeline {\n        agent any\n        stages {\n            stage('checkout git') {\n                steps {\n                    git branch: pipelineParams.branch, credentialsId: 'GitCredentials', url: pipelineParams.scmUrl\n                }\n            }\n\n            stage('build') {\n                steps {\n                    sh 'mvn clean package -DskipTests=true'\n                }\n            }\n\n            stage ('test') {\n                steps {\n                    parallel (\n                        \"unit tests\": { sh 'mvn test' },\n                        \"integration tests\": { sh 'mvn integration-test' }\n                    )\n                }\n            }\n\n            stage('deploy developmentServer'){\n                steps {\n                    deploy(pipelineParams.developmentServer, pipelineParams.serverPort)\n                }\n            }\n\n            stage('deploy staging'){\n                steps {\n                    deploy(pipelineParams.stagingServer, pipelineParams.serverPort)\n                }\n            }\n\n            stage('deploy production'){\n                steps {\n                    deploy(pipelineParams.productionServer, pipelineParams.serverPort)\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        post {\n            failure {\n                mail to: pipelineParams.email, subject: 'Pipeline failed', body: \"${env.BUILD_URL}\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNow we can setup the Pipeline of one of our applications with the following method call:\n\nJenkinsfile\n\nmyDeliveryPipeline(branch: 'master', scmUrl: 'ssh://git@myScmServer.com/repos/myRepo.git',\n                   email: 'team@example.com', serverPort: '8080',\n                   developmentServer: 'dev-myproject.mycompany.com',\n                   stagingServer: 'staging-myproject.mycompany.com',\n                   productionServer: 'production-myproject.mycompany.com')\n\nThe Shared library documentation mentions the ability to encapsulate\nsimilarities between several Pipelines with a global variable. It shows how we\ncan enhance our template approach and build a higher-level DSL step:\n\nvars/myDeliveryPipeline.groovy\n\ndef call(body) {\n    // evaluate the body block, and collect configuration into the object\n    def pipelineParams= [:]\n    body.resolveStrategy = Closure.DELEGATE_FIRST\n    body.delegate = pipelineParams\n    body()\n\n    pipeline {\n        // our complete declarative pipeline can go in here\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nNow we can even use our own DSL-step to set up the integration and deployment Pipeline of our project:\n\nJenkinsfile\n\nmyDeliveryPipeline {\n    branch = 'master'\n    scmUrl = 'ssh://git@myScmServer.com/repos/myRepo.git'\n    email = 'team@example.com'\n    serverPort = '8080'\n    developmentServer = 'dev-myproject.mycompany.com'\n    stagingServer = 'staging-myproject.mycompany.com'\n    productionServer = 'production-myproject.mycompany.com'\n}\n\nThe blog post showed how a common Pipeline template can be developed using the\nShared Library functionality in Jenkins. The approach allows to create a\nstandard Pipeline that can be reused by applications that are built in a\nsimilar way.\n\nIt works for Declarative and Scripted Pipelines as well. For declarative\npipelines the ability to define a Pipeline block in a Shared Library is\nofficial supported since version 1.2 (see the recent blog post on\nDeclarative Pipeline 1.2).","title":"Share a standard Pipeline across multiple projects with Shared Libraries","tags":["pipeline","declarative","microservices"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"pstrh","html":"","id":"pstrh","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Philip Stroh","slug":"/blog/authors/pstrh","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","id":"6b1afba0-52ca-52f3-b36e-df18f709811e","slug":"/blog/2017/09/29/jenkins-contributor-awards-at-jenkins-world/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Alyssa Tong, who runs\nthe Jenkins Area Meetup program and is also responsible for\nMarketing & Community Programs at CloudBees, Inc.\n\nFor the first time at Jenkins World, the Jenkins project honored the\nachievement of three Jenkins contributors in the areas of Most Valuable\nContributor, Jenkins Security MVP, and most Valuable Advocate.

For example, to run each parallel branch on a different agent,\nyou need to use a node step, and if you do that, the output of the parallel\nbranch won’t be available for post directives (at a stage or pipeline\nlevel). Basically the old parallel step required you to use Scripted Pipeline\nwithin a Declarative Pipeline.\n\nBut now with Declarative Pipeline 1.2, we’ve introduced a true Declarative\nsyntax for running stages in parallel:\n\nJenkinsfile\n\npipeline {\n    agent none\n    stages {\n        stage('Run Tests') {\n            parallel {\n                stage('Test On Windows') {\n                    agent {\n                        label \"windows\"\n                    }\n                    steps {\n                        bat \"run-tests.bat\"\n                    }\n                    post {\n                        always {\n                            junit \"**/TEST-*.xml\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                stage('Test On Linux') {\n                    agent {\n                        label \"linux\"\n                    }\n                    steps {\n                        sh \"run-tests.sh\"\n                    }\n                    post {\n                        always {\n                            junit \"**/TEST-*.xml\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nYou can now specify either steps or parallel for a stage, and within\nparallel, you can specify a list of stage directives to run in parallel,\nwith all the configuration you’re used to for a stage in Declarative\nPipeline. We think this will be really useful for cross-platform builds and\ntesting, as an example. Support for parallel stages will be in the\nsoon-to-be-released Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor 1.3 as well.\n\nYou can find more documentation on parallel stages in the\nUser Handbook.\n\nDefining Declarative Pipelines in Shared Libraries\n\nUntil the 1.2 release, Declarative Pipelines did not officially support\ndefining your pipeline blocks in a shared library. Some of you may have tried\nthat out and found that it could work in some cases, but since it was never an\nofficially supported feature, it was vulnerable to breaking due to necessary\nchanges for the supported use cases of Declarative. But with 1.2, we’ve added\nofficial support for defining pipeline blocks in src/.groovy files in your\nshared libraries. Within your src/.groovy file’s call method, you can\ncall pipeline { …​ }, or possibly different pipeline { …​ } blocks\ndepending on if conditions and the like. Note that only one pipeline { …​ }\nblock can actually be executed per run - you’ll get an error if a second one\ntries to execute!\n\nMajor Improvements to Parsing and Environment Variables\n\nHopefully, you’ll never actually care about this change, but we’re very happy\nabout it nonetheless. The original approach used for actually taking the\npipeline { …​ } block and executing its contents was designed almost two\nyears ago, and wasn’t very well suited to how you all are actually using\nDeclarative Pipelines. In our attempts to work around some of those limitations,\nwe made the parsing logic even more complicated and fragile, resulting in an\nimpressive\nnumber of bugs, mainly relating to inconsistencies and bad behavior with\nenvironment variables.\n\nIn Declarative 1.2, we’ve replaced the runtime parsing logic completely with a\nfar more robust system, which also happens to fix most of those bugs at the\nsame time! While not every issue has been resolved, you may find that you can\nuse environment variables in more places, escaping is more consistent,\nWindows paths are no longer handled incorrectly, and a lot more. Again, we’re\nhoping you’ve never had the misfortune to run into any of these bugs, but if\nyou have, well, they’re fixed now, and it’s going to be a lot easier for us to\nfix any future issues that may arise relating to environment variables, when\nexpressions, and more. Also, the parsing at the very beginning of your build\nmay be about 0.5 seconds faster. =)\n\nMore to Come!\n\nWhile we don’t have any concrete plans for what will be going into Declarative\nPipelines 1.3, rest assured that we’ve got some great new features in mind, as\nwell as our continuing dedication to fixing the bugs you encounter and report.\nSo please do keep opening tickets for\nissues and feature requests.

Originally filed as\nJENKINS-26481 in 2015,\nit became one of the most voted for, and watched, tickets in the entire issue\ntracker until it was ultimately fixed earlier this year.\n\nAt least some closures are executed only once inside of Groovy CPS DSL scripts\nmanaged by the workflow plugin.\n\n— Original bug description by Daniel Tschan\n\nAt a high level, what has been confusing for many users is that Scripted\nPipeline looks like a Groovy, it quacks like a Groovy, but it’s not exactly\nGroovy. Rather, there’s an custom Groovy interpreter\n( CPS) that executes the\nScripted Pipeline in a manner which provides the durability/resumability that\ndefines Jenkins Pipeline.\n\nWithout diving into too much detail, refer to the pull requests linked to\nJENKINS-26481 for that, the code snippet above was particularly challenging to\nrectify inside the Pipeline execution layer. As one of the chief architects for\nJenkins Pipeline, Jesse made a number of changes around the problem in 2016,\nbut it wasn’t until early 2017 when Andrew, working on Declarative Pipeline,\nstarted to identify a number of areas of improvement in CPS and provided\nmultiple patches and test cases.\n\nAs luck would have it, combining two of the sharpest minds in the Jenkins\nproject resulted in the \"Small Matter of Programming\" being finished, and\nreleased in May of this year with Pipeline: Groovy 2.33.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating, and thanking, Andrew and Jesse for their\ndiligent and hard work smashing one of the most despised bugs in Jenkins\nhistory :).","title":"Closure on enumerators in Pipeline","tags":["pipeline","jenkinsworld"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
