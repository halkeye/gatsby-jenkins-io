community congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!\nLet’s take a look at some changes this year.\nWe would like to thank all awesome Jenkins users and contributors who have been with us during this year.\n\nHighlights\n\nSome of the key highlights:\n\nHundreds of first-timer contributors joined the community\n\nMajor UI/UX improvements in the Jenkins core, including the landing page, plugin manager, dark theme, and read-only configurations support\n\nOutreach programs like Google Summer of Code (7 projects), Google Season of Docs, UI/UX hackfest, etc.\n\nPublic roadmap for the project\n\nTerminology changes in the project, new Code of Conduct\n\nTechnical debt cleanup: XStream unforking, Acegi Security replacement, etc.\n\nContinued evolution of the plugin ecosystem, especially in the area of Cloud Native solutions and tool integrations\n\nContinued documentation cleanup, great progress with plugin documentation migration\n\nGraduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins User Interface and User Experience\n\nThis year there were many activities around Jenkins user experience and long-anticipated user interface changes.\nThis is a coordinated effort being led by the User Experience SIG, and by many contributors to the project.\nKey project highlights:\n\nLook & Feel updates of the Jenkins Web UI, including styling rework, new typography and layouts\n\nMajor rework of plugin management UI/UX\n\nDark theme for Jenkins\n\nAccessibility improvements\n\nSupport for read-only configuration pages\n\nIn May we also organized a Jenkins UI/UX hackfest where we worked on some key stories improving user experience.\n\nJenkins security\n\nIn 2020 the Jenkins security team has released 19 advisories for the Jenkins core, plugins and other components.\nIn total 198 vulnerabilities were fixed, and 72 plugin vulnerabilities were announced without a fix at the time of advisory publishing.\nAs a project, we are receiving a continuous flow of new reports and continue to provide corrections.\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were the most popular type this year, followed by unprotected credentials.\n\nThere have also been developer tooling improvements,\nincluding GitHub CodeQL evaluation for targeted security issues search\nand Find-Sec-Bugs adoption for static analysis of the plugin and Jenkins core code.\nAlong with wider adoption of Dependabot and automated dependency scanning on GitHub.\n\nDocumentation\n\nJenkins Documentation SIG is working on creating more documentation for Jenkins on different platforms,\nincluding cloud platforms.\nJenkins on Kubernetes was one of the key stories this year for the SIG,\nalong with documentation migration to jenkins.io and wider adoption of Documentation-as-code in plugins.\n95% of the 200 most installed Jenkins plugins have moved to \"documentation as code\" or have a pending pull request with updates.\nIn total, almost 600 plugins have already been migrated.\nThere were major updates in Jenkins documentation on jenkins.io, with a lot of content being moved from the old Jenkins Wiki.\n\n2020 was the first year when Jenkins participated in Google Season of Docs (GSoD).\nThis program brings together open-source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nThis year’s student, Zainab Abubakar,\ndid an amazing job documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nNow Jenkins users can find official documentation about deploying and scaling Jenkins in Kubernetes.\nSee the project report by Zainab here.\n\nJenkins Release Automation\n\nThe Jenkins project has delivered weekly and long term support releases since it was formed in 2011.\nThose releases were delivered by Kohsuke Kawaguchi from his release infrastructure.\n\nBeginning in April 2020, those releases are delivered by the new release automation setup.\nIt is hosted within the Jenkins’ Kubernetes cluster, with fully automated management and continuous delivery of services within the setup.\nWe transitioned to new build processes, new code signing certificates, and new release automation jobs.\nThanks to Olivier Vernin and all Infrastructure sub-project contributors for the successful completion of the release automation project!\n\nMoreover, there is ongoing work on continuous delivery of Jenkins plugins ( JEP-229) and on re-designing other Jenkins instances within the project (infra-ci, trusted-ci, and ci.jenkins.io for plugins).\nIn the next few months these stories should provide Jenkins contributors with a modern environment for CI and CD of all Jenkins components.\n\nTerminology updates\n\nSince July, we have officially replaced the old \"master\" terminology with the \"controller\" term.\nIt is a follow-up to the \"agent\" terminology introduced in 2016.\nWe have also deprecated usages of the “blacklist/whitelist” terminology in all components.\nCurrently the community is working on the cleanup of the remaining occurrences in the codebase and documentation, and we invite everyone to contribute.\n\nAs a part of the terminology cleanup, last spring we announced the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.\nAs a reminder, it does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.\n\nSee more information about terminology updates here and here.\n\n“Jenkins is the Way” program\n\nThis year the Advocacy and Outreach SIG started the “Jenkins is the Way” initiative which focuses on promoting user success stories.\nOver the year, the team published 54 user stories and six case studies on https://jenkinsistheway.io/ as well as a significant amount of community marketing.\nWe also published a number of testimonial videos advertising user stories,\nincluding this Introduction to \"Jenkins is the Way\" video.\n\nSee all the stories HERE\n\nEvents\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nIn 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.\nWe had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.\nAs usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.\nThe projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes needed for the long-term evolution of Jenkins.\n\nThis is the first-ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.\nIt was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!\n\nRead more: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/22/gsoc-report/\n\nJenkins in Hacktoberfest 2020\n\nIn October we participated in Hacktoberfest.\nOur featured projects included the Jenkins core, jenkins.io website and plugins.jenkins.io, Helm charts, and multiple plugins.\nWe also encouraged contributors to participate in the Documentation as Code and terminology cleanup across the entire Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nSee the details in the Hacktoberfest page.\n\nIn total we received 226 pull requests from Hacktoberfest participants.\nSome stats per Jenkins GitHub organization:\n\n'jenkinsci', PRs: 189, Hacktoberfest contributors: 61\n\n'jenkins-infra', PRs: 100, Hacktoberfest contributors: 40\n\n'jenkins-zh', PRs: 37, Hacktoberfest contributors: 2\n\nJenkins at DevOps World\n\nThe annual DevOps World,\nformerly known as DevOps World | Jenkins World held on Sept 22-24, with workshops on Sept 25.\nJust like other events in 2020, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that didn’t mean there was a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There were over 50 Jenkins/open-source.\nAnd a special congratulations is in order to this year’s Jenkins Contributor Award winners:\n\nJames Holderness - Jenkins security MVP\n\nMarky Jackson - Most valuable Jenkins advocate\n\nTim Jacomb - Most valuable Jenkins contributor\n\nBelow are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :\n\nJenkins Where It Is and Where It Is Going\n\nOne Jenkins to Rule them All\n\nJenkins UI Gets a Makeover\n\nJenkins Pipeline and DevSecOps for API Security\n\nGraduation at Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.\nIn August the project announced that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).\nThanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!\nBelow you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:\n\nWe introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.\nThis roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.\nIt makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters, and at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.\nThe roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in JEP-14.\n\nA new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.\nThis list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,\nincluding ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.\nPlease do not hesitate to add your company there!\n\nWe passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.\nThis certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices and to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).\nIt also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.\nDetails are on the Jenkins core page.\n\nJenkins Code of Conduct was updated to the new version of Contributor Covenant.\nIn particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.\n\nMore information can be found HERE, and HERE.\n\nPublic Roadmap\n\nThe Jenkins project now has a public, community-driven project roadmap.  Roadmap items are major initiatives and are considered as official plans.\nThe roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all areas of the project.\n\nMany of the 2020 released roadmap items are mentioned elsewhere in this document, including release automation, Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification,\nuser interface improvements, read-only configuration pages,\nand Google Summer of Code projects like the GitHub Checks API or External Fingerprint Storage.\n\nOther roadmap items include mirror infrastructure improvements, a new Windows installer,\nand preview releases of pluggable storage for external fingerprints, build logs, and unit test results.\n\nJenkins 2020 Elections\n\nIn October-December the Jenkins community held the regular elections.\nThis year we were  electing for 2 governance board members and for all five officer positions, namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation. These roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being. We thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.\n\nKey results:\n\nGavin Mogan and Marky Jackson joined the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nTim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer\n\nMarky Jackson became the new Events Officer\n\nOlivier Vernin, Daniel Beck, and Mark Waite will continue as Infrastructure, Security and Documentation officers\n\nFull election results: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/03/election-results/\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project,\nit is just a slice of the key highlights mentioned by the contributors.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day. We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size. Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc. THANKS A LOT TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTechnical changes. 2021 will be another busy year for the Jenkins community.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want Jenkins to succeed.\nThere are many areas on the roadmap : UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nThere will also be a continued cleanup of old dependencies and technical debt.\nSeveral key changes are expected to land in the March LTS baseline: update to Spring Security, XStream unforking, JQuery update, etc.( announcement).\nIn addition to that, we will keep working on expanding platform support in Jenkins, including provisioning support for new Java versions and official images for more architectures like Arm.\n\nDocumentation. Documentation efforts will continue in the next year,\nwith a focus on documenting Jenkins usage on modern platforms and and automation use-cases.\nWide adoption of documentation-as-code will also continue for plugins By this time almost 600 plugins have been migrated, but there are hundreds more plugins to go.\n\nSecurity. Another important area is Jenkins security. Automation tools like Jenkins are a key part of the software delivery process in organizations, and their security is essential for the security of products.\nMisconfigured or outdated systems are a common attack vector, but there are also areas for improvement on the project’s side.\nBe sure there will be security advisories and vulnerability fixes in 2021.\nWe plan to keep adopting best security development and software delivery practices, and to improve dependency management and developer tools in the project. These areas will be in the spotlight for the project next year.\n\nEvents. Next month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a virtual Jenkins stand there.\nThere will also be a CI/CD devroom.\nIf you are interested to meet Jenkins contributors, it is a great opportunity. We also plan to continue all outreach programs and on onboarding more contributors.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement).\nWe are also ready to consider other non-coding project ideas as a part of CommunityBridge.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nJoin us in 2021!\n\nWe are always looking for more contributors, regardless of the profile and experience.\nJenkins is a vast ecosystem which includes many modern technologies.\n\nWe invite Jenkins users and contributors to participate in the community and to move these initiatives forward!\nJoin us in the mailing lists and special interest groups,","title":"2020 A Year Like No Other","tags":["community","new-year-blogpost","governance"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

the GSoC organization stipend from Google and other donations,\nthe Jenkins project usually provides travel grants to successful students so that they can visit a major community event, meet their mentors and community members in person, and present their work there.\nHere are some notes about the GSoC 2019 travel.\nUnfortunately this year it was not possible, and GSoC went completely virtual this year.\n\nOnline meetups\n\nIn August we organized Jenkins Online Meetups where students have presented their projects\n( part 1, part 2).\nYou can find recordings of these presentations in this playlist on the Jenkins YouTube channel.\n\nDevOps World\n\nThis year CloudBees, one of the Jenkins corporate sponsors, invited all students to participate in the DevOps World virtual conference on September 23-25.\nGSoC students did lighting talks about their projects, attended other conference talks, and joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation booth which represented the project at the conference.\nYou can find recordings of the talks and all materials here.\nAlthough the conference was in September, the talks were pre-recorded in early August.\nPlease refer to the Jenkins online meetup recordings for the recent versions.\n\nGSoC Mentor summit\n\nThis is a regular gathering for Google Summer of Code mentors and org admins where they share their experiences about GSoC, outreach programs, community management, and tools.\nUsually it is organized as a multi-day unconference after the end of GSoC, with 2-3 representatives from each project.\nIt has been a great learning experience to participate in it.\nThis year it was a single-day virtual event, and all mentors were able to attend.\nShivay Lamba, one of the GSoC 2020 mentors, also did a lightning talk about the GSoC projects he was working on in Jenkins and CNCF ( slides).\n\nSwag\n\nAll Google Summer of Code students and mentors get swag from Google.\nThis year, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) has sponsored swag for 50 most active GSoC participants:\nall students, mentors, and many other contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.\nThis is the third year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag,\nIn the previous years the swag logistics was one of the most challenging tasks for org admins during the entire project.\nand we highly appreciate help from CDF with this part.\nAs DevOps World presenters, the students have also received special edition speaker swag from CloudBees.\n\nThanks a lot to Google, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) and CloudBees!\n\nRetrospective\n\nAfter completion of the coding phases,\norg admins have reached out to all GSoC 2020 participants to gather their feedback and suggestions.\nWe also recommended that project teams hold their own retrospective meetings.\nSuch information is instrumental to continuously improving GSoC in the Jenkins community.\nWe thank all contributors who shared their feedback!\n\nThe organization-wide retrospective was organized as a survey and a series of retrospective meetings.\nYou can find aggregated results in this Google Doc.\nOverall, we received very positive feedback from students and mentors.\nThe GSoC framework in Jenkins has matured significantly during the previous years.\nThe effort we invested to create guidelines and recommendations for all parties helped a lot because all the expectations were known in advance.\nAs usual, there is much to improve, especially with regards to the community bonding phases and cross-project communications.\nWe are processing the feedback, and we will expand our documentation and the contributor onboarding plans next year.\n\nSome personal notes\n\nI have been involved in leading and coordinating Google Summer of Code in open source projects since 2016.\nThis year I visited the GSoC stand at FOSDEM and met a few organizers and former students.\nA few days after, I proposed participating in GSoC at the Jenkins contributor summit in Brussels,\nand several contributors supported this idea.\nWe spent several hours to create the first Jenkins GSoC page and brainstorm on project ideas.\nWe submitted our application and were accepted.\nThanks a lot to the Google team that gave us a chance!\n\nIt is great to work with the students and see how they explore the open source community and grow professionally as engineers.\nIt is also awesome to see how some of them stay in the project and keep contributing,\nincluding becoming plugin maintainers and GSoC mentors.\nBut, for me, Google Summer of Code is not just about mentoring.\nIt also helps a lot with the community bonding…​ for the existing community like Jenkins which has a lot of isolated sub-communities in plugins.\nMany maintainers work alone, and it can be quite lonely working to maintain a plugin without feedback, developer ideas, and user interactions.\nWhen plugin contributors become project mentors, they join the wider community effort and work in teams.\nIn many cases they start contributing to the organization-wide activities and goals,\nand it grows the \"backbone\" of the Jenkins community.\nLike other community-driven projects, we need such backbone to scale the community and onboard more contributors to the countless Jenkins components.\nSo far it works really well and GSoC excels among outreach programs in this regard.\n\nI would like to thank the Google Open Source team, students and all Jenkins community members for the great Google Summer of Code this year.\nWe also thank the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help to recognize contributors and allow organization administrators to focus on projects.\nLast but not least, I would like to thank the Jenkins org admin team:\nMartin d’Anjou,\nMarky Jackson, and\nKara de la Marck.\nThis was a crazy year for everyone. Regardless of that, the org admins stepped up and took responsibility for students and mentors involved in the project, with a serious time commitment.\nNot all work by the organizers is publicly visible (applications, project selection, resolving conflicts),\nbut this work is essential to the project’s success.\nThanks a lot to org admins and mentors who helped with the administrative tasks this year!\n\nWhat’s about GSoC 2021?\n\nYes, we plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021.\nThe application period for organizations will start in a few months,\nbut we have already started preparing for the next GSoC session.\nWe are looking for mentors, org admins and project ideas.\nPlease contact us if you are interested!\n\nCall for Mentors and Project Ideas\n\nGSoC 2021 project ideas\n\nHOWTO: Propose a project idea\n\nInformation for mentors : guidelines and expectations\n\nWe invite potential students to start exploring the project and the available project ideas.\nOriginal ideas are always welcome in the project, and starting early is a great opportunity to\nget introduced to the Jenkins community, collect more information about the problem areas,\nand to create a good proposal.\n\"Start early\" is the most popular recommendation from GSoC 2020 participants to future GSoC students,\nand we encourage you to follow this advice!","title":"Google Summer of Code 2020 summary","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2020","jenkins","community","events","mentor"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"blog/author/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9753ae32-51e9-5bc8-9342-e525dab1f74c","slug":"/blog/2020/12/17/jira-upgrade-for-the-jenkins-project/","strippedHtml":"The Jenkins project has used Jira to track issues for many years.\nJenkins core, Jenkins modules, Jenkins infrastructure, and many Jenkins plugins manage their issue reports with our Jira server.\n\nJira helps the Jenkins project manage issues and tasks related to over 250 000 Jenkins installations.\nIt tracks bugs, enhancement requests, tasks, and security issues.\nIt is used regularly by users around the world.\n\nWe’re grateful for the long-standing contribution that Atlassian provides by donating the Jira license to the Jenkins project.\nWe’re grateful to the Oregon State University Open Source Lab for their donation of equipment and bandwidth to host the server.\n\nUpgrade Timeline\n\nWe were running Jira 7.13 and had been managing that installation for a few years.\nAtlassian announced that Jira 7.13 would end its support life on November 28, 2020.\nWe needed to upgrade from Jira 7.13 to a more recent version of Jira.\nAs part of our membership in the Continuous Delivery Foundation, a Linux Foundation initiative, we could use their project services team to manage our Jira server.\nWe decided to move from hosting our own Jira server to having the Jira experts at the Linux Foundation host it.\n\nThe upgrade timeline looked like this:\n\nNovember 2019 - Infrastructure team begins discussions about the November 2020 end of support for Jira 7.13\n\nAugust 2020 - First conversations with Linux Foundation to host Jira for the Jenkins project.  Draft of the upgrade plan assembled and shared with the community\n\nSeptember 2020 - Schedule for testing week and final transition week proposed.  Authentication options evaluated and selected\n\nOctober 2020 - Test upgrade performed and tested\n\nNovember 2020 - Final upgrade completed and verified\n\nConfronting the Complications\n\nInitial discussions between the Jenkins infrastructure team and the Linux Foundation identified complications related to authentication and SSL certificates.\nWe planned, negotiated, and tested our assumptions throughout the project.\n\nAuthentication\n\nJira servers at the Linux Foundation typically use Linux Foundation accounts for user access.\nUnfortunately, the Jenkins LDAP database includes over 100,000 users and for many of them, Linux Foundation username doesn’t correspond to Jenkins account username.\nIt was not feasible to transition 100,000 user accounts from the Jenkins LDAP database to the Linux Foundation accounts system and still complete the Jira upgrade before the November 28, 2020 deadline.\n\nThe Linux Foundation Project Services team evaluated authentication alternatives and confirmed that they could use the Jenkins LDAP server.\nUsing the Jenkins LDAP server spared us from two transitions, LDAP and Jira, and kept the project timeline feasible.\n\nSSL Certificates\n\nJira servers at the Linux Foundation use Let’s Encrypt to generate SSL certificates for HTTPS.\nThe Linux Foundation uses the DNS method to obtain SSL certificates.\nUnfortunately, the Jenkins project uses the HTTP method to obtain SSL certificates.\n\nThankfully, Olivier Vernin of the Jenkins project and Anton Baranov of the Linux Foundation found a solution.\nThey created an ACME record in the Jenkins DNS server and pointed the issues.jenkins.io DNS record at the new Linux Foundation Jira server.\n\nBuilding the Prototype\n\nAnton Baranov created a prototype Jira server, restored an older Jenkins Jira backup, and upgraded it to Jira 8.13.\nThat first restore detected that we had not provided the Jira attachments or the Jira avatars.\nThat attachments and avatars added multiple gigabytes to the initial backup data and were vital to complete the update.\n\nTesting the Upgrade\n\nA group of volunteers including Jenkins users, security team members, and infrastructure team members tested the upgrade during the week of October 26, 2020.\nThe tests confirmed that authentication worked as expected and that the Jira prototype was functioning as expected.\n\nWe thank the test team, including:\n\nDaniel Beck\n\nTim Jacomb\n\nOlivier Vernin\n\nMark Waite\n\nThe tests included:\n\nCreating and routing issues\n\nCommenting on issues\n\nViewing dashboards with the expected content\n\nLDAP settings\n\nEmail notification\n\nThe tests detected minor issues that Anton was able to correct in preparation for the final upgrade.\nThe testing team agreed that the tests were successful.\n\nDeploying the Upgrade\n\nOlivier Vernin announced the final upgrade by email to the Jenkins infra list with details of the changes happening during the upgrade.\nMonday, November 9, 2020, the final backup of the existing Jira server was copied into the new Linux Foundation server.\n\nThe final upgrade encountered issues that we had not seen during the initial tests.\nThe \"bumps and bruises\" from the unexpected issues were resolved by Anton Baranov as he used a multi-step upgrade process.\nThe steps included:\n\nRestore the earlier backup to Jira 7.13\n\nRestore the most recent backup\n\nUpgrade to Jira 8.13\n\nInstall avatars, attachments, and other images\n\nUpdate DNS entries to point to the new Jenkins Jira server\n\nLessons from the Upgrade\n\nLessons were related to timing, estimation, and communication.\n\nScheduling the Upgrade\n\nThe test upgrade started the week of October 19, 2020.\nIt took several days longer than originally expected.\nThankfully, we had allowed an extra week between the test upgrade and the production upgrade.\n\nThe originally announced schedule for the final upgrade was intentionally placed in a week that would not include a long term support release.\nThat reduced the risk of disruption if the upgrade took longer than required or failed and we had to roll back.\n\nEstimating the Work\n\nDiscussions with the Jenkins project Jira administrators and the Linux Foundation Jira experts provided very reasonable estimates of time to complete the work.\nWe intentionally allowed additional time between first test and final upgrade.\nWe needed that additional time and used it well as the testing week.\n\nCommunicating the Plan\n\nThe distributed nature of the Jenkins project makes communication challenging for major changes.\nWe communicated plans at various stages but still found occasions where the communication was insufficient.\nIn this case, the adage held true that it is, \"impossible to communicate too much\".\n\nThanks for your patience during the upgrade and thanks to the Linux Foundation for administering the Jenkins Jira server.","title":"Jira upgrade for

Summer of Code (GSoC)\nis a program where students are paid a stipend by Google to work on a free open source project.\nStudents work on the project for three months (June to August).\nPrior to the coding phase, there is a month of community bonding, to welcome students to the Jenkins community and acquaint them with the projects processes for communication and collaboration.\nMentors are actively involved with students from March when students start to work on and submit their applications.\n(see the timeline)\n\nWe are looking for project ideas and mentors to participate in GSoC 2021.\nGSoC project ideas are coding projects that university or college students can accomplish in about three months.\nThe coding projects can be new features, plugins, test frameworks, infrastructure, etc.\nAnyone can submit a project idea, but of course we like it even better if you offer to mentor your project idea.\n\nWe accept new project ideas at any time,\nHowever, project ideas need to be finalised before February 19th, 2021 at 7pm UTC,\nwhich is the deadline for the Jenkins organization to apply to the GSoC program.\nPlease send us your project ideas before the beginning of February so they can get a proper review by the GSoC committee and by the community.\n\nHow to submit a project idea\n\nCreate a pull-request with your idea in a.adoc file\nin the project ideas.\nIt is not necessary to submit a Google Doc, but it will still work if you want to do that.\nSee the instructions on submitting ideas which include an.adoc template and some examples.\n\nCurrent list of ideas\n\nWe currently have a list of project ideas for students to browse.\nNote that this list is subject to change.\n\nWhat does mentoring involve?\n\nPotential mentors are invited to read the information for mentors.\nNote that being a GSoC mentor does not require expert knowledge of Jenkins.\nMentors do not work alone. We make sure that every project has at least two mentors.\nGSoC org admins will help to find technical advisers, so you can study together with your students.\n\nMentoring takes about 5 to 8 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).\nMentors provide guidance, coaching, and sometimes a bit of cheerleading.\nThey review student proposals, pull-requests and the students presentations\nat the evaluation phase.\nThey fill in the Google provided evaluation report form at the end of coding periods.\n\nWhat do you get in exchange?\n\nIn return of mentoring, a student works on your project full time for three months.\nThink about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but never had the time…​\n\nMentoring is also an opportunity to improve your management and people skills, while giving back to the community.\n\nThere will be a Google Mentor Summit which takes place every year.\nIn 2020, the Mentor Summit was virtual, but in previous years the summit has taken place in person.\n\nSee this post\nabout the 2019 in person Mentor Summit.\n\nGSoC is a fantastic program and the Jenkins project is happy to participate in GSoC again in 2021!\n\nFor any question, you can find the GSoC Org Admins,\nmentors and participants on the GSoC SIG Gitter chat.","title":"Google Summer of Code 2021 call for Project Ideas and Mentors","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2021","community","events","developer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"MarckK","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kara works with the open source community at CloudBees.\nShe is co-chair of the Continuous Delivery Foundation’s Interoperability SIG and a mentor and org admin for Outreachy and Google Summer of Code.\nAs a board director of codebar.io, Kara works to increase diversity in the tech industry.\nShe is passionate about making technology accessible and building welcoming tech communities.</p>\n</div>","id":"marckk","irc":null,"linkedin":"karadelamarck","name":"Kara de la Marck","slug":"blog/author/marckk","twitter":"KaraMarck"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"53f79d7e-fbae-5ff1-9c1d-0b57ccbf4a00","slug":"/blog/2020/12/11/devops-world-2020-jenkins-contributors-awarded-top-honors-at-devops-worlds-2020/","strippedHtml":"At DevOps World on September 24, 2020, through the sponsorship of CloudBees, three Jenkins contributors were recognized for their contributions to the Jenkins project.

We found that some submitted stories were far too big to be constrained by our format of 'background/goal/solution/results.'\n\nSome Jenkins users had a much more complex story to tell, whether it was about getting upper management to buy-in, keeping developers happy, or simply making sure pipelines weren’t just bottlenecks in disguise.\n\nHere are a handful of Jenkins Case Studies we’ve published in the past few months, with many more on the way!\n\nCase Study #1: D4Science\n\nAmping up scientific research with CI/CD powered by Jenkins\n\nTo promote open science practices and support scientific communities while serving 11k registered users in 45 countries, D4Science introduced a new delivery pipeline that replaced their pre-existing build platform.\n\nOf course, they had to build and release their software framework (gCube) in a way that would support multi-project releases at scale — from 200+ Git repositories within the same day! It had to be fast, automate all release activities, and it had to deliver incremental releases to address user requirements quickly. Most of all, the solution had to be cost-effective.\n\nUsing Jenkins, they created an innovative approach to software delivery: a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, scalable, easy to maintain, and upgradable at a minimal cost.\n\nDiscover how D4Science empowers e-Science and virtual research communities with software released via Jenkins. Read the Jenkins case study featuring D4Science here!\n\nCase Study #2: Gainsight\n\nHumanizing CSX with tech innovation and a robust DevSecOps platform\n\nGainsight’s customer service experience platform helps customer success teams at more than 100 leading IT and healthcare clients. How? By driving engagement for tens of thousands of their customers.\n\nThat’s why the engineering team at Gainsight approached the customer experience by building a smarter, faster DevSecOps platform using Jenkins. They stuck to an infrastructure-as-code approach while integrating various tools and programming languages all within the platform. And they secured processes with better visibility and air-tight quality control.\n\nThe result was a flexible DevSecOps infrastructure, 95% of which is scalable with code. And the cost of infrastructure costs was 40% less. That provides Gainsight with ease of collaboration, keener operational insight, and — because builds are 30% faster — the ability to stay a step ahead of the competition.\n\nRead why Gainsight’s lead DevOps engineer, Prudviraj Pentakota, says \"Jenkins is the epicenter of DevSecOps in our organization.\" Get the full story here.\n\nCase Study #3: Avoris Travel\n\nReinventing travel with an inventive technology platform\n\nPart of Barceló Group, Ávoris Travel is behind prominent destination travel brands like LeSki, Le Musik, and a selection of author travels under its \"Viagens Com Assinatura\" signature travel concept. A proprietary database and a smart, dynamic booking engine are the tickets to offering differentiating and inventive travel opportunities.\n\nAlso unique to Avoris is a discreet machining technology that enables agents to enter specific criteria to search and find all types of trips and travel opportunities across the entire network.\n\n\"Our infrastructure is very important because we have to be online to meet customer demand anywhere in the world,\" said Alejandro Alvarez Vazquez, Sysadmin, Avoris Travel. \"Our CI/CD platform is used by 200 people. The services that we build and deploy are used by thousands of potential clients and by our network of 675 own agencies located in Spain and Portugal.\"\n\nRead the case study to learn how the flexibility of Jenkins plugins helped Avoris reduce build times by over 50% and became a go-to, scalable infrastructure supporting 675 agencies and over 2.8 million international consumers.\n\nWhat’s your story?\n\nWe want to know what you’re building with Jenkins and would love to post your case study on our\"Jenkins Is The Way\" website, a global showcase of how developers and engineers build, deploy, and automate great stuff with Jenkins.\n\nThe best way to get started is to share your Jenkins User story with us. We’ll send you a free Jenkins Is The Way T-Shirt in return and publish your account for the entire Jenkins community to see. And if it’s selected for a Case Study, we’ll be in touch for a one-on-one interview!

is the world’s leading open-source automation server used by companies large and small around the globe to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery.\nKubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.\nKubernetes is compatible with the majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests, deploy builds in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.\nOne of the most popular CI/CD tools now is Jenkins thereby making Jenkins on Kubernetes a popular theme for Jenkins users.\n\nDuring the Google Season Of Docs program, I worked with the Jenkins organization on the project - Document Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nThe original proposal for this project can be found here.\n\nProject Goals\n\nAfter my proposal was accepted by the Jenkins organization, my mentors and I agreed on the expectations for the Google Season of Docs project.\nThe goal of this project was to create a new Kubernetes Volume which would describe the concepts, techniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins thereby providing the following advantages:\n\nImprove the user experience of Jenkins on Kubernetes users by giving them a one-stop-shop for information on Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nMake it easy to track, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nReference the existing community documentation for Jenkins on K8s (plugins and tools/integrations).\n\nHow to guides, tutorials and explanations of concepts and techniques in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nJust-In-Time documentation which means that rather than documenting every feature comprehensively, we produce and release documentation in bits but continuously based on popular questions, feedback and area of interests gathered from the community and users.\n\nCommunity Bonding: Planning the solution\n\nFind below an outline of my activities during the community bonding phase:\n\nSetting up communication channels: meetings, mailings, chats: My mentors and I agreed on the right time and channel for communication due to time difference.\nWe agreed to meet twice weekly, on Mondays and Thursdays at 7:00 PM GMT +1 and use Jenkins documentation gitter channel for other communications.\n\nContacting Stakeholders and onboarding contributors: The project was  announced on social media and different Jenkins channels.\nI wrote a blog post to announce the project and created a project page on Jenkins.io.\n\nKnowledge transfer: I and my mentors planned knowledge sharing sessions and fixed tentative dates based on the availability of the trainers.\nMy mentors also shared useful resources to help me prepare for the project.\n\nGetting permissions: I and my mentors agreed I didn’t need any special permissions from the beginning, however, this topic was left open for discussion if the need arose later on in the project.\n\nPre-planning of the project: I refined my goals and set expectations with my mentor and also learned more about the community(Jenkins).\nI also had to ensure that the proposed documentation structure I drafted was in line with the goals of the organization so my mentors vetted it and we finalized on the proposed sections that I was supposed to work on.\n\nDocumentation Development Phase\n\nKnowledge Sharing Sessions\n\nDuring the development phase, my mentors hosted two knowledge sharing sessions:\n\nKatacoda and Helm by Marky Jackson\n\nSee the slides\n\nHelm by Torsten Walter\n\nSee the slides\n\nThese sessions gave me an in-depth understanding of concepts and tools needed for the project.\n\nJenkins on Kubernetes Documentation Skeleton\n\nAt the application phase, I drafted a structure describing the proposed Jenkins on Kubernetes section.\nMy intention was to use it as a guide during the implementation phase of the project, but when the development phase kicked off, my mentors and I thought of a better approach to creating a new Jenkins on Kubernetes section which was to add the Jenkins on Kubernetes contents to existing related sections for easier navigation and better user experience.\nAn example of this approach would be creating the Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes section under the Installing Jenkins section rather than putting it under an entirely new section.\nWith this new approach, I was assigned a task to create a skeleton with all the proposed Jenkins on Kubernetes sections on Jenkins.io and mark these sections as\nWork In Progress (WIP).\nThe Plan was to use this skeleton as a guide throughout the GSOD Project.\nThe Jenkins on Kubernetes skeleton PR can be found here.\n\nDocumenting Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nWhile working on this project, I had to do a lot of research and test all the documented steps locally before pushing the documentation out for review.\nI also made sure to use updated terms and terminologies where necessary like Controller instead of Master and Agents instead of Slave.\n\nDuring the documentation phase, I was able to work on documenting Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes with three sections Helm, Set of Yaml files and Jenkins Operator.\nI also worked on creating a directory for Jenkins on kubernetes sample files in Jenkins.io repository, documenting Scaling Jenkins on Kubernetes and Jenkins on AWS which is still in progress.\n\nWork Done\n\nPull Requests : All the pull requests I submitted to Jenkins.io documentation can be found here.\nThis spreadsheet contains links to the published documentation on Jenkins.io.\nThe spreadsheet also highlights the initial proposed tasks and the status of each of them.\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes documentation, you can check out pending tasks here and reach out in the Jenkins documentation gitter channel.\n\nChallenges\n\nUsing a Windows computer was a bit of a challenge for me.\nTo run Jenkins.io locally, the project uses GNU/Make and Docker in order to generate the fully statically generated jenkins.io web site.\nThe key tool for converting source code into the site is the Awestruct static site generator, which is downloaded automatically as part of the build process.\nTo achieve this, I needed to have GNU/Make and Docker available on my machine.\nDocker was not a problem, but to achieve the latter, I needed to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\nWSL had two versions WSL1 and WSL2. Using WSL2 would have been much more convenient, but my version of windows wasn’t compatible with WSL2 as it required Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher for x64 systems.\nWith this obstacle, I had to stick to making WSL1 work but I still couldn’t get this to work, a series of issues came up which I was able to pass through with the help of my mentors until I got stuck at permission issues.\nI raised the issue with my mentor and after looking through the issue with me and trying to solve it to no avail, he suggested setting up an Ubuntu VM in Hyper-V.\nThis article helped me achieve this and that solved my problem.\n\nWhat did I learn?\n\nI learned a lot more about the Jenkins project, Kubernetes, helm package manager, Jenkins Operator and much more.\nThis project also gave me the opportunity to work with cloud providers like AWS which was totally new to me and also learn from field experts through knowledge sharing sessions and weekly meetings with my mentors and org admin.\nMy technical writing skill and communication skill have definitely become better and I owe it to this project.\n\nOverall, contributing to the Jenkins.io project is an amazing experience for me.\nI have been using Jenkins, and the fact that I was able to contribute to the organization and collaborate with the community is an honor.","title":"GSOD Project Report: Document Jenkins on Kubernetes","tags":["kubernetes","helm","documentation","gsod","gsod2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"zaycodes","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Zainab is a software developer and technical writer who is passionate about contributing to open source, improving technical documentation and advocating for gender diversity in open source collaboration.

I am so humbled.\nBeing part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.\nMy goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.\nI look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.\n\n— Marky Jackson, Jenkins Governance Board Member and Events Officer\n\nStatement from Gavin Mogan:\n\nGavin here. I’m still in shock that I got voted in for the Jenkins board.\nIt felt like yesterday I just got started helping people randomly on IRC. This is truly exciting.\nI plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.\nThis is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.\nMy specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.\n\n— Gavin Mogan, Jenkins Governance Board Member\n\nOfficer election details\n\nAll 5 officer positions were up for election this year.\nThese roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2021.\nAfter the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,\n4 officer positions were uncontested:\n\nOlivier Vernin - Infrastructure officer.\n\nMarky Jackson - Events officer.\nMarky inherits this role from Alyssa Tong\nwho decided to step down from the officer role and to focus on the Jenkins community marketing,\nincluding Jenkins Is The Way and many other initiatives started by Alyssa.\n\nMark Waite - Documentation officer.\n\nDaniel Beck - Security officer.\n\nThanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!\nOfficers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.\nIt requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.\n\nRelease Officer election results\n\nTim Jacomb won the biggest support as a Release officer ( voting results).\nTim will replace in this role Oliver Gondža\nwho has been leading the Release Team and the release processes since 2016 when the role was officially introduced.\n\nTim Jacomb (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nBaptiste Mathus  loses to Tim Jacomb by 40–23\n\nVictor Martinez  loses to Tim Jacomb by 38–25, loses to Baptiste Mathus by 32–31\n\nHere is a statement from Tim Jacomb:\n\nI’m excited for the year ahead, let’s see where we can take the Jenkins release area in the future.\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation, ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team,\nand ensure that responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.\n\n— Tim Jacomb, Jenkins Release Officer\n\nThanks to Alyssa Tong and Oliver Gondža for their long-time service as Jenkins officers!\nWe are looking to continue working with them in the Jenkins community.\nAnd congratulations to Tim Jacomb and Marky Jackson for joining the team!\n\nStatistics\n\nThis year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.\nIt is significantly lower than in the 2019 elections when we had almost 350 voters.\nIt can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.\nThis year we decided to not use the previous voter registration system,\nand we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.\nThis is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nThe last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.\nWith help of many contributors and with the renewed board,\nwe have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,\nfor example hosting contributor summits,\npublishing the public roadmap,\nCode of Conduct update,\nterminology changes,\nand graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.\nThere is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.\n\nIn short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.\n\nThere are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:\nlong-anticipated features and architecture changes,\nchanging the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process,\ncreating better communication channels with Jenkins users,\nand onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to contribute!\n\nFeedback\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe will appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process so that we can improve the process.\nWe
