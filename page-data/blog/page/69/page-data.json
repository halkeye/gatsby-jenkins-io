This has been a real community effort, with collaboration from lots of people, both in terms of implementation and in terms of providing honest/critical feedback. Lots of people deserve credit but, in particular, a big thanks to https://github.com/kevinburke[Kevin Burke] and https://github.com/daniel-beck[Daniel Beck]. +\n +\n\n+\nYou're probably familiar with how the Jenkins UI currently looks, but for the sake of comparison I think it's worth showing a screenshot of the current/old UI alongside a screnshot of the new UI. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/current.png[ +\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/current.preview.png[image,width=500] +\n] +\n\n+\n*_Current / Old Look & Feel_* +\n\n+\nhttps://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/new.png[ +\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/new.preview.png[image,width=500] +\n] +\n\n+\n*_New Look & Feel_* +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nAmong other things, you'll see: +\n\nA new responsive layout based on elements (as opposed to elements). Try resizing the screen or viewing on a smaller device. More to come on this though, we hope.\n\nUpdated default font from Verdana to Helvetica.\n\nNicer form elements and nicer buttons.\n\nSmoother side panels e.g. Build Executors, Build Queues and Build History panes.\n\nSmoother project views with more modern tabs.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nYou might already be seeing these changes if you're using the latest and greatest code from Jenkins. If not, you should see them in the next LTS release. +\n +\n\n+\nWe've been trying to make these changes without breaking existing features and plugins and, so far, we think we've been successful but if you spot anything you think we might have had a negative effect on, then https://issues.jenkins.io[please log a JIRA] and we'll try to address it. +\n +\n\n+\nOne thing we've \"sort of\" played with too is cleaning up of the Job Config page - breaking into sections and making it easier to navigate etc. This is a big change and something we've been shying away from because of the effect it will have on plugins and form submission. That said, I think we'll need to bite the bullet and tackle this sooner or later because it's a big usability issue. +","title":"User Interface Refresh","tags":["development","core","guest post","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","id":"7c3ce68e-ef94-57f3-950b-d3f660ff7e66","slug":"/blog/2014/07/30/geek-choice-awards-2014/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/58000204/Geek-Choice-Awards-CI-Server-300x300-black.png?version=1&modificationDate=1406550449057[image,width=100,height=100] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nRebelLabs started annual https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/10-kick-ass-technologies-modern-developers-love/12/[Geek Choice Awards], and Jenkins was one of the 10 winners.

I comissioned https://www.fast-d.com/search/engineers/2798[akiki], a 3D model designer, to turn our beloved butler into a fully-digital color-printable figure.

The figure is about 2.5in/6cm tall. The price includes a bit of markup toward recovering the cost of the design. My goal is to sell 25 of them, which will roughly break it even. Any excess, if it ever happens, will be donated back to the project. +\n +\n\n+\nLikewise, once I hit that goal, I will make the original data publicly available under CC-BY-SA, so that other people can modify the data or even print it on their own 3D printers. +","title":"Jenkins figure is available in shapeways ","tags":["general","just for fun"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a719689c-677f-5692-b88d-1756defede7a","slug":"/blog/2014/07/18/juc-israel-report/","strippedHtml":"+\nThis year marks the 3rd annual Jenkins User Conference in Israel.

Sponsors would like to know more about attendees, but attendees are often weary of getting contacted. Our past few JUCs have been run by making it opt-in to have the contact information passed to sponsors, but the ratio of people who opt-in is too low. So we started thinking about adjusting this. +\n +\n\n+\nSo our current plan is to reduce the amount of data we collect and pass on, but to make this automatic for every attendee. Specifically, we'd limit the data only to name, company, e-mail, and city/state/country you are from. But no phone number, no street address, etc. We discussed this in http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2014/jenkins.2014-07-09-18.02.html[the last project meeting], and people generally seem to think this is reasonable. That said, this is a sensitive issue, so we wanted more people to be aware. +\n +\n\n+\nBy the way, https://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb[the call for papers to JUC Bay Area] is about to close in a few days.
