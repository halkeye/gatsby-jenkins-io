I comissioned https://www.fast-d.com/search/engineers/2798[akiki], a 3D model designer, to turn our beloved butler into a fully-digital color-printable figure.

Sponsors would like to know more about attendees, but attendees are often weary of getting contacted. Our past few JUCs have been run by making it opt-in to have the contact information passed to sponsors, but the ratio of people who opt-in is too low. So we started thinking about adjusting this. +\n +\n\n+\nSo our current plan is to reduce the amount of data we collect and pass on, but to make this automatic for every attendee. Specifically, we'd limit the data only to name, company, e-mail, and city/state/country you are from. But no phone number, no street address, etc. We discussed this in http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2014/jenkins.2014-07-09-18.02.html[the last project meeting], and people generally seem to think this is reasonable. That said, this is a sensitive issue, so we wanted more people to be aware. +\n +\n\n+\nBy the way, https://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb[the call for papers to JUC Bay Area] is about to close in a few days.
