Absolutely zero\ndownloads were being redirected, meaning that cucumber, the 1U machine\ngraciously colocated by Contegix had served up\nfar more bits than I ever wanted it to.\n\nAs such, I would like to publicly apologize to Contegix on behalf of the\nJenkins project. Their support for the project has been tremendous but\nthis glitch caused such an incredible amount of traffic to be pushed through\ntheir network that I feel exceptionally bad about it (turns out, Jenkins is pretty popular!)\n\nNow, for the good news. In diagnosing and debugging this issue (in a\ncaffeine-fueled frenzy I might add) I managed to do a couple things:\n\nI corrected the redirection relatively easily\n\nI fixed our long-standing geo-location issue, finally enabling redirection to our european\nand asian mirrors!\n\nWithin 30 minutes of correcting the error, I was able to add two mirrors in\nGermany, re-enable one from Taiwan and add a new mirror in Japan!\n\nI’m hoping to add even more mirrors in even more regions as volunteers with\nbandwidth step-forward, if you’re interested in hosting a mirror you can drop\nme a line at tyler@linux.com.","title":"Mirror, mirror on the wall","tags":["infrastructure","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

We talked about problems on the horizon, potential solutions, and then I spent the last half hour ripping a bit of code.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that most of the changes that have to be done to Jenkins core have already been made, so now the bulk of the heavy lifting falls to the Ruby side of things (right now, me).\n\nAnyhow, on to the notes!\n\nAttendees\n\n@kohsukekawa, @cowboyd\n\nextract more stuff into the jenkins-plugins.rb support library (@cowboyd)\n\nWe’re in the process of extracting, normalizing, documenting all the goop that’s currently residing in the ruby plugins playground into a formal plugin support gem called jenkins-plugins https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugins.rb\n\nrecruit Rubyists to implement non-Jenkins specific code (@kohsukekawa)\n\nIf you know Ruby and would like to be able to write Jenkins plugins with it, but don’t know the first thing about Jenkins and/or JRuby, that’s OK. You can help by implementing some of the cucumber features found in that repo\n\n@kohsukekawa is going to be knocking on your door to ask if you’re ready to step up, so I hope you’ve been nice this year!\n\ntesting strategy (@cowboyd, @kohsukekawa)\n\nRuby folk love their tests, and a plugin develompent solution won’t be complete unless testing is a breeze. That means that as we extract the plugin support library, we take make sure you can test plugin classes in isolation.\n\nOn the Jenkins side, KK will think about how to run tests that require a full Jenkins environment. A system like this exists currently for testing java plugins, but some thought might be required on how to do this for Ruby.\n\npackaging reloaded (@kohsukekawa)\n\nKK is going to jump in and write some rake tasks to take a ruby plugin structure and package it into a valid .hpi file, and with no maven involved.  According to him, Ruby plugins aren’t the only system that wants to run maven-free. There is desire to be able to do plugin development with Gradle (another Java build system), so this could be a double win.\n\ndifferent schedule (@kohsukekawa)\n\n8:30pm Central in North America, doesn’t seem to be a very good time. Especially for hackers in Asia Pacific. KK will investigate a new time that works for everybody and encourages more participation.","title":"Ruby Plugins Hack Session Notes 6/23/2011","tags":["development","core","ruby","jruby"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"cowboyd","html":"","id":"cowboyd","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Charles Lowell","slug":"/blog/authors/cowboyd","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","id":"8539ff06-0574-55b9-9484-a9980b131b14","slug":"/blog/2011/06/16/jenkins-long-term-support-release/","strippedHtml":"We have released 1.409.1, our first long-term support (LTS) release, from the Jenkins project.\n\nThe idea of the LTS release is to provide a second release line the favors more stability and bug fix only maintenance. This release line branches off from a bit old Jenkins release (in this case 1.409), and we will only put important backported bug fixes. We’ll keep releasing 1.409.2, 1.409.3, and so on, as such bugs appear, and in several months (our current thinking is 3 months) we’ll designate another release and repeat this process all over again. I think it provides more comfortable upgrade path for larger deployments. For more about this, see Wiki.\n\nIn large companies that use Jenkins in a large scale, there often is a team of people who looks at incoming Jenkins release, tests it with their environments and their plugins, and then let their internal group consume them. With this release line, I’m calling for them to join the effort on this branch. Vojtech Juranek from Red Hat is already helping us tremendously, so is Yahoo in choosing the base release line and backporting. But it’d be great to get more people on board, as I think it’ll benefit everyone to have a larger number of eyeballs on the same code. You’ll also have a say on what bugs need to be backcported, etc. If you are interested in this effort, please let us know.","title":"Jenkins Long-Term Support Release","tags":["general","core","releases","lts"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b8816000-c17a-523b-b88f-638b6fb6ab53","slug":"/blog/2011/06/14/upcoming-events-in-june-and-early-july/","strippedHtml":"I’ve just added three events coming up in the next few weeks to the Jenkins calendar.

We’ll be talking about Jenkins, maybe doing some coding, and then heading out for drinks and more talk! You can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA few days later, TNG Technology Consulting is generously hosting a meetup in Munich, on Wednesday, June 30th, starting at 3pm. I’ll be giving a quick talk on the state of the Jenkins project, followed by Ullrich Haffner (the author of the static analysis plugins for Jenkins) giving a quick talk on how those plugins are used. After that, we’ll be having a hackathon, and then more beer! Again, you can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA week later, the London CI meetup group is hosting a meetup as well, on Wednesday, July 6th, starting at 6:30pm.
