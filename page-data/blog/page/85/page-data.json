Jenkins is here to help!  With the Join Plugin you can do just that.  Over on the confluence page it’s got a number of examples and fancy flow charts.  But the take-away is that if you can describe the flow, you can make it happen.  But you’re saying \"wait, I need to pass information around between the jobs.\"\n\nWe’ve got that one covered for you too with the Parameterized Trigger Plugin.  And here’s the best part, these two can work together!  With both plugins installed you can follow the steps listed in the Build Parameters section of the Join Plugin. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/join_trigger.png\n\nAnd as they say, now you’re cooking with gas!","title":"Building a software diamond with Jenkins","tags":["general","guest post","plugins","tutorial"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

About 10 people came, including the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Static+Code+Analysis+Plug-ins[static code analysis plugin] fame Ullrich Hafner, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin[Androd emulator plugin] fame https://twitter.com/orrc[Christopher Orr], the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin[instant messenger plugin] (and others) fame https://twitter.com/#!/kutzi[Christoph Kutzinski]. Some of us came from pretty far away places like Munich, Bonn, and Netherland. There was a good mix of existing developers and new developers, too. +\n +\n\n+\nDuring the hackathon, new folks developed whopping three plugins — a security realm that connects to https://github.com/jenkinsci/kerberos-authenticator-plugin[Kerberos (password entering kind, not SSO)], https://github.com/jenkinsci/builton-column-plugin[a plugin that adds a list view column to show where the last build was done], and https://github.com/jenkinsci/extra-columns-plugin/[another plugin that attempts to collect small list view column implmentations]. German translations were improved, automated installation of Android SDKs are discussed and its implementation strategies explained. I've done my share of contribution by working on https://github.com/jenkinsci/jruby-xstream[XStream support for JRuby], which is one of the ground work necessary for JRuby-based Jenkins plugin development, and I also showed the prototype Groovy-based templating that can potentially supercede Jelly. There were additional exchange of tips and tricks, how you do this and that. +\n +\n\n+\nStrong coffee and engaged conversations kept me awake all day, although German keyboard layout (on top of usual IDE difference + Mac/PC difference) made it hard to code on other people's computers, but all in all it was a very productive hackathon. In fact, the best ever. We wrapped up around 7pm and headed to a seafood restaurant near Elbe river, stayed there until 11pm-ish. +\n +\n\n+\nThe next hackathon is planned in Paris toward the end of the month. I'm looking forward to another productive Hackathon, so if you are nearby, please https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/17178842/[RSVP and join us]. +","title":"Hamburg hackathon a great success!","tags":["development","core"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":"83452a29-9888-5633-8c2f-855fba38f873","slug":"/blog/2011/04/14/jenkins-new-look/","strippedHtml":"As you might have noticed Jenkins finally has\na brand spankin' new logo!
