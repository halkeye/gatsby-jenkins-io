This release line branches off from a bit old Jenkins release (in this case 1.409), and we will only put important backported bug fixes. We’ll keep releasing 1.409.2, 1.409.3, and so on, as such bugs appear, and in several months (our current thinking is 3 months) we’ll designate another release and repeat this process all over again. I think it provides more comfortable upgrade path for larger deployments. For more about this, see Wiki.\n\nIn large companies that use Jenkins in a large scale, there often is a team of people who looks at incoming Jenkins release, tests it with their environments and their plugins, and then let their internal group consume them. With this release line, I’m calling for them to join the effort on this branch. Vojtech Juranek from Red Hat is already helping us tremendously, so is Yahoo in choosing the base release line and backporting. But it’d be great to get more people on board, as I think it’ll benefit everyone to have a larger number of eyeballs on the same code. You’ll also have a say on what bugs need to be backcported, etc. If you are interested in this effort, please let us know.","title":"Jenkins Long-Term Support Release","tags":["general","core","releases","lts"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b8816000-c17a-523b-b88f-638b6fb6ab53","slug":"/blog/2011/06/14/upcoming-events-in-june-and-early-july/","strippedHtml":"I’ve just added three events coming up in the next few weeks to the Jenkins calendar.

We’ll be talking about Jenkins, maybe doing some coding, and then heading out for drinks and more talk! You can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA few days later, TNG Technology Consulting is generously hosting a meetup in Munich, on Wednesday, June 30th, starting at 3pm. I’ll be giving a quick talk on the state of the Jenkins project, followed by Ullrich Haffner (the author of the static analysis plugins for Jenkins) giving a quick talk on how those plugins are used. After that, we’ll be having a hackathon, and then more beer! Again, you can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA week later, the London CI meetup group is hosting a meetup as well, on Wednesday, July 6th, starting at 6:30pm. We’ll be meeting up at the Royal Festival Hall for discussion and drinking.

About 10 people came, including the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Static+Code+Analysis+Plug-ins[static code analysis plugin] fame Ullrich Hafner, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin[Androd emulator plugin] fame https://twitter.com/orrc[Christopher Orr], the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin[instant messenger plugin] (and others) fame https://twitter.com/#!/kutzi[Christoph Kutzinski]. Some of us came from pretty far away places like Munich, Bonn, and Netherland. There was a good mix of existing developers and new developers, too. +\n +\n\n+\nDuring the hackathon, new folks developed whopping three plugins — a security realm that connects to https://github.com/jenkinsci/kerberos-authenticator-plugin[Kerberos (password entering kind, not SSO)], https://github.com/jenkinsci/builton-column-plugin[a plugin that adds a list view column to show where the last build was done], and https://github.com/jenkinsci/extra-columns-plugin/[another plugin that attempts to collect small list view column implmentations]. German translations were improved, automated installation of Android SDKs are discussed and its implementation strategies explained. I've done my share of contribution by working on https://github.com/jenkinsci/jruby-xstream[XStream support for JRuby], which is one of the ground work necessary for JRuby-based Jenkins plugin development, and I also showed the prototype Groovy-based templating that can potentially supercede Jelly. There were additional exchange of tips and tricks, how you do this and that. +\n +\n\n+\nStrong coffee and engaged conversations kept me awake all day, although German keyboard layout (on top of usual IDE difference + Mac/PC difference) made it hard to code on other people's computers, but all in all it was a very productive hackathon. In fact, the best ever. We wrapped up around 7pm and headed to a seafood restaurant near Elbe river, stayed there until 11pm-ish. +\n +\n\n+\nThe next hackathon is planned in Paris toward the end of the month.
