As Release Engineer in a company with\nseveral development teams, it comes in handy using several Jenkins instances.\nWhile this approach works fine in our company and gives the developers a lot of\nfreedom, we came across some long-term problems concerning maintenance and\nstandards. These problems were mostly caused by misconfiguration or non-use of\nplugins. With “configuration as code” in mind, I took the approach to apply\nstatic code analysis with the help of SonarQube, a platform to manage code\nquality, for all of our Jenkins job configurations.\n\nAs a small centralized team, we were looking for an easy way to control the\nhealth of our growing Jenkins infrastructure. With considering “configuration\nas code“, I developed a simple extension of SonarQube, to manage the quality\nand usage of all spawned Jenkins instances. The given SonarQube features (like\ncustomized rules/metrics, quality profiles and dashboards) allow us and the\ndevelopment teams to analyze and measure the quality of all created jobs in our\ncompany. Even though Jenkins configuration analysis cannot cover all\nSonarQube’s axes of code quality, I think there is still potential for\nconventions/standards, duplications, complexity, potential bugs\n(misconfiguration) and design and architecture.\n\nThe results of this analysis can be used by all people working with Jenkins. To\nachieve this, I developed a simple extension of SonarQube, containing\neverything which is needed to hook up our SonarQube with our Jenkins\nenvironment. The implementation contains a new basic-language “Jenkins“ and an\ninitial set of rules.\n\nOf course the needs depend strongly on the way Jenkins is being used, so not\nevery rule implemented might be useful for every team, but this applies to all\ntypes of code analysis. The main inspirations for the rules were developer\nfeedback and some articles found in the web. The different ways Jenkins can be\nconfigured provides the potential for many more rules. With this new approach\nof quality analysis, we can enforce best practices like:\n\nPolling must die (Better to triggerb uilds from pushes than poll the\nrepository every x minutes).\n\nUse Log Rotator (Not using log-rotator can result in disk space problems on\nthe controller).\n\nUse agents/labels (Jobs should be defined where to run).\n\nDon’t build on the controller (In larger systems, don’t build on the controller).\n\nEnforce plugin usage (For example: Timestamp, Mask-Passwords).\n\nNaming sanity (Limit project names to a sane (e.g. alphanumeric) character\nset).\n\nAnalyze Groovy Scripts (For example: Prevent System.exit(0) in System Groovy\nScripts).\n\nBesides taking control of all configuration of any Jenkins instance we want,\nthere is also room for additional metrics, like measuring the amount and\ndifferent types of jobs (Freestyle/Maven etc…​) to get an overview about the\ngeneral load of the Jenkins instance. A more sophisticated idea is to measure\ncomplexity of jobs and even pipelines. As code, jobs configuration gets harder\nto understand the more steps are involved. On the one hand scripts, conditions\nand many parameters can negatively influence the readability, especially if you\nhave external dependencies (like scripts) in different locations. On the other\nhand, pipelines can also grow very complex when many jobs are involved and\nchained for execution. It will be very interesting for us to see where and why\ntoo complex pipelines are being created.\n\nOn visualization we rely on the data and its interpretation of SonarQube, which\noffers a big bandwidth of widgets. Everybody can use and customize the\ndashboards. Our centralized team for example has a separate dashboard where we\ncan get a quick overview over all instances.\n\nThe problem of \"growing\" Jenkins with maintenance problems is not new.\nEspecially when you have many developers involved, including with the access to\ncreate jobs and pipelines themselves, an analysis like this SonarQube plugin\nprovides can be useful for anyone who wants to keep their Jenkins in shape.\nCustomization and standards are playing a big role in this scenario. This blog\npost surely is not an advertisement for my developed plugin, it is more about\nthe crazy idea of using static code analysis for Jenkins job configuration. I\nhaven’t seen anything like it so far and I feel that there might be some\npotential behind this idea.\n\nJoin me at my Enforcing Jenkins Best Practices session at the 2016 Jenkins\nWorld to hear more!\n\nDavid will be\npresenting\nmore of this concept at\nJenkins World in September.\nRegister with the code JWFOSS for 20% off your full conference pass.","title":"Enforcing Jenkins Best

is a guest post by Liam Newman,\nTechnical Evangelist at CloudBees.\n\nTesting web applications across multiple browsers on different platforms can be challenging even for smaller applications.\nWith Jenkins and the\nSauce OnDemand Plugin,\nyou can wrangle that complexity by defining your Pipeline as Code.\n\nPipeline ♥ UI Testing, Too\n\nI recently started looking for a way to do browser UI testing for an open-source JavaScript project to which I contribute.\nThe project is targeted primarily at\nNode.js\nbut we’re committed to maintaining browser-client compatibility as well.\nThat means we should run tests on a matrix of browsers.\nSauce Labs\nhas an \"open-sauce\" program that provides free test instances to open-source projects.\nI decided to try using the\nSauce OnDemand Plugin\nand\nNightwatch.js\nto run Selenium tests on a sample project first, before trying a full-blown suite of tests.\n\nStarting from Framework\n\nI started off by following Sauce Labs' instructions on\n\" Setting up Sauce Labs with Jenkins\"\nas far as I could.\nI installed the\nJUnit and\nSauce OnDemand\nplugins, created an account with Sauce Labs, and\nadded my Sauce Labs credentials to Jenkins.\nFrom there I started to get a little lost.\nI’m new to Selenium and I had trouble understanding how to translate the instructions to my situation.\nI needed a working example that I could play with.\n\nHappily, there’s a whole range of sample projects in\n\" saucelabs-sample-test-frameworks\"\non GitHub, which show how to integrate Sauce Labs with various test frameworks, including Nightwatch.js.\nI forked the Nightwatch.js sample to\nbitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js\nand set to writing my Jenkinsfile.\nBetween the sample and the Sauce Labs instructions,\nI was able to write a pipeline that ran five tests on one browser via\nSauce Connect :\n\nnode {\n    stage \"Build\"\n    checkout scm\n\n    sh 'npm install' (1)\n\nstage \"Test\"\n    sauce('f0a6b8ad-ce30-4cba-bf9a-95afbc470a8a') { (2)\nsauceconnect(options: '', useGeneratedTunnelIdentifier: false, verboseLogging: false) { (3)\nsh './node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -e chrome --test tests/guineaPig.js || true' (4)\njunit 'reports/**' (5)\nstep([$class: 'SauceOnDemandTestPublisher']) (6)\n}\n    }\n}\n\n1\nInstall dependencies\n\n2\nUse my\npreviously added sauce credentials\n\n3\nStart up the\nSauce Connect\ntunnel to Sauce Labs\n\n4\nRun Nightwatch.js\n\n5\nUse JUnit to track results and show a trend graph\n\n6\nLink result details from Sauce Labs\n\nThis pipeline expects to be run from a Jenkinsfile in SCM.\nTo copy and paste it directly into a Jenkins Pipeline job, replace the checkout scm step with\ngit url:'https://github.com/bitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js', branch: 'sauce-pipeline'.\n\nI ran this job a few times to get the JUnit report to show a trend graph.\n\nThis sample app generates the SauceOnDemandSessionID for each test, enabling the Jenkins Sauce OnDemand Plugin’s result publisher to link results to details Sauce Labs captured during the run.\n\nAdding Platforms\n\nNext I wanted to add a few more platforms to my matrix.\nThis would require changing both the test framework configuration and the pipeline.\nI’d need to add new named combinations of platform, browser, and browser version (called \"environments\") to the Nightwatch.js configuration file,\nand modify the pipeline to run tests in those new environments.\n\nThis is a perfect example of the power of pipeline as code.\nIf I were working with a separately configured pipeline,\nI’d have to make the change to the test framework, then change the pipeline manually.\nWith my pipeline checked in as code,\nI could change both in one commit,\npreventing errors resulting from pipeline configurations going out of sync from the rest of the project.\n\nI added three new environments to nightwatch.json :\n\n\"test_settings\" : {\n  \"default\": { /*----8 <----*/ },\n  \"chrome\": { /*----8 <----*/ },\n\n  \"firefox\": {\n    \"desiredCapabilities\": {\n      \"platform\": \"linux\",\n      \"browserName\": \"firefox\",\n      \"version\": \"latest\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"ie\": {\n    \"desiredCapabilities\": {\n      \"platform\": \"Windows 10\",\n      \"browserName\": \"internet explorer\",\n      \"version\": \"latest\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"edge\": {\n    \"desiredCapabilities\": {\n      \"platform\": \"Windows 10\",\n      \"browserName\": \"MicrosoftEdge\",\n      \"version\": \"latest\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAnd I modified my Jenkinsfile to call them:\n\n//----8 (1)\n'chrome',\n        'firefox',\n        'ie',\n        'edge'\n    ].join(',')\n    // Run selenium tests using Nightwatch.js\n    sh \"./node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -e ${configs} --test tests/guineaPig.js\" (2)\n} //----8\n\n1\nUsing an array to improve readability and make it easy to add more platforms later.\n\n2\nChanged from single-quoted string to double-quoted to support variable substitution.\n\nTest frameworks have bugs too. Nightwatch.js (v0.9.8) generates incomplete JUnit files,\nreporting results without enough information in them to distinguish between platforms.\nI implemented a fix for it and\nsubmitted a PR to Nightwatch.js.\nThis blog shows output with that fix applied locally.\n\nAs expected, Jenkins picked up the new pipeline and ran Nightwatch.js on four platforms.\nSauce Labs of course recorded the results and correctly linked them into this build.\nNightwatch.js was already configured to use multiple worker threads to run tests against those platforms in parallel, and\nmy Sauce Labs account supported running them all at the same time,\nletting me cover four configurations in less that twice the time,\nand that added time was most due to individual new environments taking longer to complete.\nWhen I move to the actual project, this will let me run broad acceptance passes quickly.\n\nConclusion: To Awesome and Beyond\n\nConsidering the complexity of the system, I was impressed with how easy it was to integrate Jenkins with Sauce OnDemand to start testing on multiple browsers.\nThe plugin worked flawlessly with Jenkins Pipeline.\nI went ahead and ran some additional tests to show that failure reporting also behaved as expected.\n\n//----8 (1)\n//----8\n\n1\nRemoved --test filter to run all tests\n\nEpilogue: Pipeline vs. Freestyle\n\nJust for comparison here’s the final state of this job in Freestyle UI versus fully-commented pipeline code:\n\nThis includes the\nAnsiColor Plugin\nto support Nightwatch.js' default ANSI color output.\n\nFreestyle\n\nPipeline\n\nnode {\n    stage \"Build\"\n    checkout scm\n\n    // Install dependencies\n    sh 'npm install'\n\n    stage \"Test\"\n\n    // Add sauce credentials\n    sauce('f0a6b8ad-ce30-4cba-bf9a-95afbc470a8a') {\n        // Start sauce connect\n        sauceconnect(options: '', useGeneratedTunnelIdentifier: false, verboseLogging: false) {\n\n            // List of browser configs we'll be testing against.\n            def platform_configs = [\n                'chrome',\n                'firefox',\n                'ie',\n                'edge'\n            ].join(',')\n\n            // Nightwatch.js supports color ouput, so wrap this step for ansi color\n            wrap([$class: 'AnsiColorBuildWrapper', 'colorMapName': 'XTerm']) {\n\n                // Run selenium tests using Nightwatch.js\n                // Ignore error codes. The junit publisher will cover setting build status.\n                sh \"./node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -e ${platform_configs} || true\"\n            }\n\n            junit 'reports/**'\n\n            step([$class: 'SauceOnDemandTestPublisher'])\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis pipeline expects to be run from a Jenkinsfile in SCM.\nTo copy and paste it directly into a Jenkins Pipeline job, replace the checkout scm step with\ngit url:'https://github.com/bitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js', branch: 'sauce-pipeline'.\n\nNot only is the pipeline as code more compact,\nit also allows for comments to further clarify what is being done.\nAnd as I noted earlier,\nchanges to this pipeline code are committed the same as changes to the rest of the project,\nkeeping everything synchronized, reviewable, and testable at any commit.\nIn fact, you can view the full set of commits for this blog post in the\nblog/sauce-pipeline\nbranch of the\nbitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js\nrepository.\n\nLinks\n\nSauce OnDemand Plugin\n\nbitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js\n\nsaucelabs-sample-test-frameworks","title":"Browser-testing with Sauce OnDemand and Pipeline","tags":["tutorial","pipeline","plugins","saucelabs","selenium","nightwatch"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#382818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/77b35/lnewman.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/d4a57/lnewman.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/68974/lnewman.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/ef6ff/lnewman.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/8257c/lnewman.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/6766a/lnewman.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/22bfc/lnewman.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"bitwiseman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Liam started his software career as a tester, which might explain why he&#8217;s such a fan of CI/CD and Pipeline as Code.\nHe has spent the majority of his software engineering career implementing Continuous Integration systems at companies big and small.\nHe is a Jenkins project contributor and an expert in Jenkins Pipeline, both Scripted and Declarative.\nLiam currently works as a Jenkins Evangelist at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>.\nWhen not at work, he enjoys testing gravity by doing Aikido.</p>\n</div>","id":"lnewman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Liam Newman","slug":"/blog/authors/lnewman","twitter":"bitwiseman"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ddf1a677-43d3-5209-a6e7-d331d574df38","slug":"/blog/2016/08/26/ask-the-experts-jenkins-world/","strippedHtml":"Our events officer Alyssa has been working for\nthe past several weeks to organize the \"Open Source Hub\" at\nJenkins World 2016.

There is likely a constrained\ntool set to support - not an abundance of flavors of applications and security\npractices - and generally fewer cooks in the kitchen. But in a larger\norganization, I have found that in the past, there were seemingly endless\nunique requirements and mountains to climb to reach this level of automation on\neach new project.\n\nNeil will be presenting more\nof this concept at Jenkins World in\nSeptember, register with the code JWFOSS for a 20% discount off your pass.\n\nEnter the Jenkins Pipeline plugin. My recently departed former company, a large\nfinancial services organization with a 600+ person IT organization and 150+\napplication portfolio, set out to implement continuous delivery\nenterprise-wide. After considering several pipeline orchestration tools, we\ndetermined the Pipeline plugin (at the time called Workflow) to be the superior\nsolution for our company. Pipeline has continued Jenkins' legacy of presenting\nan extensible platform with just the right set of features to allow\norganizations to scale its capabilities as they see fit, and do so rapidly. As\nearly adopters of Pipeline with a protracted set of requirements, we used it\nboth to accelerate the pace of onboarding new projects and to reduce the\nongoing feature delivery time of our applications.\n\nIn my presentation at Jenkins World, I will demonstrate the methods we used to\nenable this. A few examples:\n\nWe leveraged the Pipeline Remote File Loader plugin to write shared common\ncode and sought and received community enhancements to these functions.\n\nJenkinsfile, loading a shared AWS utilities function library\n\nawsUtils.groovy, snippets of some AWS functions\n\nWe migrated from EC2 agents to Docker-based agents running on Amazon’s\nElastic Container Service, allowing us to spin up new executors in seconds\nand for teams to own their own executor definitions.\n\nPipeline run #1 using standard EC2 executors, spinning up EC2 instance for each\nnode; Pipeline run #2 using shared ECS cluster with near-instant instantiation\nof a Docker agent in the cluster for each node.\n\nWe also created a Pipeline Library of common pipelines, enabling projects\nthat fit certain models to use ready-made end-to-end pipelines. Some\nexamples:\n\nMaven JAR Pipeline: Pipeline that clones git repository, builds JAR file\nfrom pom.xml, deploys to Artifactory, and runs maven release plugin to\nincrement next version\n\nAnuglar.JS Pipeline: Pipeline that executes a grunt and bower build, then\nruns S3 sync to Amazon S3 bucket in Dev, then Stage, then Prod buckets.\n\nPentaho Reports Pipeline: Pipeline that clones git repository, constructs\nzip file, and executes Pentaho Business Intelligence Platform CLI to import new\nset of reports in Dev, Stage, then Prod servers.\n\nPerhaps most critically, a shout-out to the saving grace of this quest for our\nsecurity and ops teams: the manual 'input' step! While the ambition of\ncontinuous delivery is to have as few of these as possible, this was the\nsingle-most pivotal feature in convincing others of Pipeline’s viability, since\nnow any step of the delivery process could be gate-checked by an LDAP-enabled\npermission group. Were it not for the availability of this step, we may still\nbe living in the world of: \"This seems like a great tool for development, but\nwe will have a segregated process for production deployments.\" Instead, we had\na pipeline full of many 'input' steps at first, and then used the data we\ncollected around the longest delays to bring management focus to them and unite\neveryone around the goal of strategically removing them, one by one.\n\nGoing forward, having recently joined Aquilent’s Cloud Solutions Architecture\nteam, I’ll be working with our project teams here to further mature the use of\nthese Pipeline plugin features as we move towards continuous delivery. Already,\nwe have migrated several components of our healthcare.gov project to Pipeline.\nThe team has been able to consolidate several Jenkins jobs into a single,\nvisible delivery pipeline, to maintain the lifecycle of the pipeline with our\napplication code base in our SCM, and to more easily integrate with our\nexternal tools.\n\nDue to functional shortcomings in the early adoption stages of the Pipeline\nplugin and the ever-present political challenges of shifting organizational\npolicy, this has been and continues to be far from a bruise-free journey. But\nwe plodded through many of these issues to bring this to fruition and\nultimately reduced the number of manual steps in some pipelines from 12 down to\n1 and brought our 20+ Jenkins-minute pipelines to only six minutes after months\nof iteration. I hope you’ll join this session at Jenkins World and learn about\nour challenges and successes in achieving the promise of continuous delivery at\nenterprise scale.","title":"Continuously Delivering Continuous Delivery Pipelines","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/authors/hinman","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9a0e4574-a766-5c76-b7d9-8fc1d1fbcde3","slug":"/blog/2016/08/11/speaker-blog-edx-jenkins-world/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Ben Patterson, Engineering Manager at\nedX.\n\nPicking a pear from a basket is straightforward when you can hold it in your hand, feel its weight, perhaps give a gentle squeeze, observe its color and look more closely at any bruises. If the only information we had was a photograph from one angle, we’d have to do some educated guessing.\n\nAs developers, we don’t get a photograph; we get a green checkmark or a red x. We use that to decide whether or not we need to switch gears and go back to a pull request we submitted recently. At edX, we take advantage of some Jenkins features that could give us more granularity on GitHub pull requests, and make that decision less of a guessing game.\n\nMultiple contexts reporting back when they’re available\n\nPull requests on our platform are evaluated from several angles: static code analysis including linting and security audits, javascript unit tests, python unit tests, acceptance tests and accessibility tests. Using an elixir of plugins, including the GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin, we put more direct feedback into the hands of the contributor so s/he can quickly decide how much digging is going to be needed.\n\nFor example, if I made adjustments to my branch and know more requirements are coming, then I may not be as worried about passing the linter; however, if my unit tests have failed, I likely have a problem I need to address regardless of when the new requirements arrive. Timing is important as well. Splitting out the contexts means we can run tests in parallel and report results faster.\n\nDevelopers can re-run specific contexts\n\nOccasionally the feedback mechanism fails. It is oftentimes a flaky condition in a test or in test setup. (Solving flakiness is a different discussion I’m sidestepping. Accept the fact that the system fails for purposes of this blog entry.) Engineers are armed with the power of re-running specific contexts, also available through the PR plugin. A developer can say “jenkins run bokchoy” to re-run the acceptance tests, for example. A developer can also re-run everything with “jenkins run all”. These phrases are set through the GitHub Pull Request Builder configuration.\n\nMore granular data is easier to find for our Tools team\n\nSplitting the contexts has also given us important data points for our Tools team to help in highlighting things like flaky tests, time to feedback and other metrics that help the org prioritize what’s important. We use this with a log aggregator (in our case, Splunk) to produce valuable reports such as this one.\n\nI could go on! The short answer here is we have an intuitive way of divvying up our tests, not only for optimizing the overall amount of time it takes to get build results, but also to make the experience more user-friendly to developers.\n\nBen will be presenting more on this topic at\nJenkins World in September,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 20% discount off your pass.","title":"Using Jenkins for Disparate Feedback on GitHub","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/authors/hinman","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":8,"skip":376,"numPages":100,"currentPage":48}},
