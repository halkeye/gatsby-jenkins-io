Overall the event was a major success and we’re very happy we were able to take part in it!\n\nFor FOSDEM 2013, we’ll be back in Brussels and participating in a major way. The first day of FOSDEM (February 2, 2013) will be the 2nd birthday for the Jenkins project, and seems appropriate that project founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi will be giving a keynote session titled: \" How we made the Jenkins community \"\n\nHere’s an excerpt from Kohsuke’s talk proposal:\n\nJenkins project has an interesting history. It started from scratch on my spare time, and grow over time to boast 600+ open-source plugins developed by 300+ contributors from all around the world.\n\nThere are several key ingredients, both technical and social, that enabled this model, and I think those ingredients are useful to other projects. In this talk, I’ll discuss how Jenkins project and the community works, what these ingredients are, why they help you attract more developers into your projects, and why it matters.\n\nYou can read more about Kohsuke’s keynote here\n\nIn addition to the keynote, I ( R. Tyler Croy), and a number of members of the Jenkins, Cucumber and Selenium communities are hosting the first ever Testing and Automation devroom at FOSDEM.\n\nIf you’re interested in submitting a talk proposal for the dev room the deadline is 23:59 UTC on December 21st 2012! The Call for Proposals can be found here, and the proposal submission form can can be found here.\n\nWe are very likely going to have a table in the hall again this year, but the FOSDEM committee hasn’t yet confirmed whether or not we will have a table.\n\nRegardless, a lot of Jenkins community members will be at FOSDEM in February in addition to hundreds of other open source contributors and users from around the world.\n\nIf you’re interested in participating and/or meeting up with the Jenkins crowd, there’s details coming together on the FOSDEM wiki page .\n\nWe hope to see you there!","title":"Jenkins keynote at FOSDEM 2013","tags":["general","cia","meetup","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Jenkins potential to make peoples lives easier is really amazing.\nYou guys are amazing.\nAnd Kohsuke, you’re my personal hero :-)\n\nAll right, that being said, let’s move on with the story.\n\nMost people who like FreedomSponsors probably don’t know that Jenkins is sort of the reason it exists in the first place. That’s right, if it wasn’t for Jenkins I’d probably never had the idea for FS.\n\nThis is how it happened.\n\nI was playing with the ( Jenkins OpenID plugin), and I was having some trouble with it.\nAfter a little research, I found that there was a JIRA bug for it - ( JENKINS-9216: Make OpenID work with Google Apps accounts).\n\n\"Bummer\" - I thought - \"Maybe I can try to debug it. Oh boy, but I don’t know anything about Jenkins code. That would be too…​ expensive! I bet there are a few people out there that would be willing to even pay a few bucks to the Jenkins crew to prioritize this.\"\n\nThe moment I thought that, a storm of ideas came rushing into my head.\nIt was like a conversation with myself in my mind.\n\n\"Wait a minute…​ why can’t people actually do just that?! They should be able to.\"\n\n\"Maybe a JIRA plugin could let them…​\"\n\n\"But what about other projects, ones that don’t use JIRA?\"\n\n\"Maybe there could be a central place for all those offers. If many people 'sponsor' the same issue, the developer who solve it might get a decent piece of gold - rightfully deserved. That could even free up more of their time to work on the projects they love :-)\"\n\n\"The sponsors would pay the developers out of gratitude, and for the sake of keeping their word.\"\n\n\"This has the Agile spirit in it: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\"\n\nAnd I kept thinking, and it didn’t took very long until I had the whole \"sponsoring model\" in my head.\nI realised that that was one of the best ideas I had in my life. I was very excited and I had to act on it.\n\nI started studying Django on that same day. I had already learned some Python before and Django had been on my queue for some time. And I’m glad I did it. I’ve been building JavaEE (Java web) applications for about 8 years now, and, oh boy, Django makes things soooo much easier, and simpler, and faster to code - I’m in love with it…​ Okay, but I’m missing the point here.\n\nSo, I started building \"it\" alone on my free time. It took me a few days to pick a name for \"it\".\nThe \"FreedomSponsors\" name came very naturally - it rightfully conveys what the platform would do, and the spirit of software freedom that I’d like to encourage.\n\nSeven weeks later it was done. I had already bought the domain and created an account at Amazon AWS.\nSo I put it up and started bugging everyone about it.\nAnd guess who was the first person I wanted to tell? Kohsuke Kawaguchi :-)\nIt was just fair. So I sent him this email.\n\nOn Sun, Jul 8, 2012 at 3:36 AM, Tony França tonylampada@gmail.com wrote:\n\nHi Kohsuke.\nMy name is Tony, I’m a Software Architect.\nI’m a big fan and a (very) heavy user of Hudson - Jenkins.\nIt has really been enabling our company to move towards a \"continuous delivery\"-like development process in the past couple of years.\n\nSo, thank you for that.\n\nAlso, if it wasn’t for Jenkins, maybe I would never had the idea to build the FreedomSponsors web site.\nThat’s my personal project - an idea that I had about six weeks ago.\n\nYou see, most of the time I was developing it, I had you in mind.\nI have always felt that \"Jenkins is so great, that Kohsuke really deserves to get rich for it\".\n\nI just launched FreedomSponsors - a few minutes ago.\nIt just felt right to come here and tell you about it :-)\n\nLet’s see if I can get you rich now :-).\n\nCheers!\nTony Lâmpada\n\nAnd his reply just made my day\n\nOn Thu, Jul 12, 2012 at 5:19 PM, Kohsuke Kawaguchi wrote:\n\nCongratulations for launching your service.\n\nI thought about a similar idea long time ago over a lunch with my colleagues, but my hats off to you for actually making it real. I can imagine a lot of obstacles (most of those you already note in FAQ), but if this works out I think it’d be great.\n\nBy the way, I wonder if you have considered open-sourcing this, say under Aflo GPL. With the network effect and being the dominant contributor, it’s very difficult for anyone else to run the same code on public internet to compete with you, and it does let other people contribute small changes, and given your audience is open-source developers, I think it sends the right message as well as help you boost your development. It also seeds the ecosystem (of Bugzilla plugin, JIRA plugin, dashboard, etc.), too.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n\nYou see, FS’s code was still closed when I launched it. I was worried about competition indeed.\nBut his arguments were very convincing. Specially when he talked about sending the right message to the Free Software community. I thought about it for while and came to the conclusion that he has absolutely right. It still took me a few weeks until I moved the code to Github. I’m glad I did it. The feedback loop has been great.\n\nAnd that was not his only contribution. He also gave us this very useful piece of feeback:\n( JIRA plugin to link from tickets to FreedomSponsors)\n\nIndeed, that was a great idea. My friend and associate Arthur is the one who built it.\nKohsuke suggested that I joined the Jenkins crew at the ( Jenkins Governance meeting) to see if everyone would agree about installing it on Jenkins JIRA. Everyone liked the idea and had no ojections.\n\nI can’t say enough how trilled and honored I felt knowing that Jenkins would be the first project to install our plugin. Thank you folks. Thanks Kohsuke. You guys are awesome :-)\n\nNow FreedomSponsors is growing, slowly but steadily. And what makes us really happy is that almost every developer we tell about it just loves the idea. We’ve received valuable, constructive feedback from a lot of people who want to see us moving forward. That’s the best incentive that I could wish for.\n\nWe still have a lot of challenges ahead of us. The biggest and closest one in the horizon is to start a \"movement\" that will help spread within companies a culture of contributing more to the free software projects they depend on, by making they realise that that’s what’s best for everyone. If we can achieve that then we’ll have made the free software world even better.\n\nSo, everything I wrote so far is, hopefully, only the begginning of this story. And I’m really excited and looking forward to see it unfold. Being a part of it is even more exciting.\n\nWhat about you?
