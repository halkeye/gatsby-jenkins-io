Between FOSDEM\nSouthern California Linux Expo (also known as\nSCaLE) we seem to hand out more stickers during the last week in January than\nany other week of the year.\n\nThis year’s SCaLE 14X conference finally outgrew the LAX Hilton in Los Angeles,\nwhere it had been hosted in years past, and moved over to the Pasadena\nConvention Center in Pasadena California. While the organizers of the\nconference expanded their scope, so did the Jenkins project!\n\nIn addition to our normal Jenkins stickers, we also had some special edition\nstickers with special\nlogos to give away this year, namely:\n\nAngry Jenkins\n\nGeneral Jenkins\n\nSuperhero Jenkins\n\n\"Cute\" Jenkins\n\nNinja Jenkins\n\nTo accompany the stickers we also had both blue Jenkins and red \"Angry Jenkins\"\npins. Savvy Jenkins users might recognize \"Angry Jenkins\" from the Jenkins\nserver’s internal 500 page; fortunately however very few people that came by\nthe booth to say 'hello' were familiar with Angry Jenkins.\n\nTalking Points\n\nAside from talking about the cool stickers and pins, we spent the vast\nmajority of time talking about Jenkins to two groups of people:\n\nthose who never had actually used Jenkins, even if they had heard of it\n\nusers who knew plenty about Jenkins but hadn’t actually heard about some of\nthe Jenkins 2.0 Proposals.\n\nAnecdotally, it seemed like most of the people that I talked to about \"Jenkins\n2.0\" were pretty excited about the Jenkinsfile idea and starting to define\ntheir build processes and delivery pipelines as code\nin their source repositories.\n\nPerhaps more importantly though, we spoke with many users about where Jenkins\nis causing them pain or frustration. Speaking directly with users at events\nlike SCaLE or Jenkins Area Meetups is always fun, having a high-bandwidth\nconversation about what we can do better and/or offering solutions/workarounds\nto hopefully relieve some pain-points.\n\nIn one such case, a contributor approached me and complained that he had\nemailed the developers' mailing list and frustratingly never actually received\na response. Comically enough, neither of us were able to find the email he had\nsent the mailing list (whoops!) but because of the dynamic nature of booth-duty\nat SCaLE, we got him squared away with a repository to contribute a\nJenkins Charm for the Juju\nconfiguration management tool.\n\nJammin'\n\nAmong the booth-duty highlights was meeting a few folks who were interested on\nstarting a southern California Jenkins meetup. Over the days following the\nconference, and a brief discussion on the\njenkinsci-jam@\nmailing list, and the\nLos Angeles\nJenkins Area Meetup was born!\n\nI’m looking forward to the meetup growing over the next couple months and\nhelping build a stronger local Jenkins community in Southern Califonia for the\nother 51 weeks a year that SCaLE isn’t happening.\n\nSCaLE is one of my more favorite\nopen source conferences, the positive community in attendance, a kid-friendly\natmosphere (\"Game Night\" was a blast) and the broad spectrum of sessions\navailable make it a great way to spent the weekend in southern California.\n\nWe hope to see you there again next year!","title":"SCaLE 14x Conference Report","tags":["scale","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

It will be a developer-focused session where we’ll start off by talking a little about how UI development has traditionally been done in Jenkins, before moving on to some newer patterns and tools that we have been developing over the last few months that let us make use of a wider range of more modern client-side development tools.

For example, I could not\nfind a solution which gives me the possibility to easily decide which data\nshould be display in the widget and which not. It also doesn`t have the\npossibility to add additional widgets to the dashboard which have nothing to do\nwith Jenkins. So I came up with something interesting that includes Jenkins\ndata. But I cannot do that with the existing built-in dashboards from Jenkins\nplugins which are Jenkins-content specific.\n\nSo I decided to write a new, flexible and extensible dashboard. To avoid\nre-inventing the wheel I also decided to use\ndashing-js as a basis and not\nJenkins itself. dashing-js is a Node.js port of\nDashing, a Sinatra -based\nframework that lets you build beautiful dashboards.\n\nThe key features of Dashing are:\n\nUse pre-made widgets, or fully create your own with Sass, HTML and CoffeeScript\n\nWidgets harness the power of data bindings (via batman.js) to keep things DRY and simple\n\nUse the API to push data to your dashboards or make use of a simple Node.js script for fetching data\n\nDrag & drop interface for re-arranging your widgets\n\nThe advantage over a native Java-based Jenkins plugin is that you don’t need to\nknow Java and the whole Java stack. You can also easily add other pre-made\nthird-party widgets, for example a GitHub Pull Request count widget or an AWS\nstatistic widget or whatever else. In other words, it is completely independent\nof Jenkins. All you need is Node.js and the permission to access the\nJenkins API.\n\nBeside dashing-js you will need my\nJenkins Job widget. It is a\ngeneric widget for Jenkins jobs which provides a highly visible view of the\nbuild status and build progress of selected Jenkins jobs. Via configuration it\nis possible to add multiple widgets for different Jenkins jobs (as you can see\nin the screenshot below).\n\nSo, all you need is dashing-js, my Jenkins Job widget and some\nnpm packages.  The installation and the setup is really\neasy and can be found here.\n\nExample","title":"A beautiful Jenkins dashboard","tags":["dashboard"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"http://blog.kj187.de","github":"kj187","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Julian Kleinhans is working as a Software Architect at <a href=\"https://www.aoe.com\">AOE GmbH</a> in Krefeld.\nBeside his passion as a developer, he is also passionate about whiskey.\nHis blog deals with various topics such as web development and whisky tasting.</p>\n</div>","id":"kj187","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Julian Kleinhans","slug":"/blog/authors/kj187","twitter":"kj187"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","id":"89aaaaa5-cde6-5023-9381-353a81e305b6","slug":"/blog/2016/01/07/official-code-of-conduct/","strippedHtml":"Over the past couple months, we have been working on a long overdue\nCode of Conduct for the Jenkins project (meeting minutes\nhere\nand\nhere).\nFollowing in the footsteps of other projects like the\nApache Software\nFoundation, Go lang and\ncountless others, we have adopted this\ncode of conduct to help set guidelines for what behaviors are acceptable, and\nwhat behaviors are not, when acting within the Jenkins community or on behalf\nof the Jenkins project.\n\nI would like to extend our gratitude to the authors of\nthe Contributor Covenant who provided us\nwith a very good and mostly finished Code of Conduct template.
