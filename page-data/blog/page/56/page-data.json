Like Jenkins itself, Drupal is easy to set up, install\nplugins and authoring content is done in a web UI. For the past seven years Drupal\nhas served us well, but it is time to move on to something better suited for our needs.\n\nThe general requirements for something newer were:\n\nEasy to edit and create content\n\nChanges to content should be tracked and reviewable\n\nAny Jenkins contributor should be able to participate\n\nSupport mixed content types\n\nThe consensus was that a statically-generated site, with raw content hosted on\nGitHub, would meet the majority of the \"ease-of-use\" type requirements. The\nremainder could be addressed depending on the implementation. A couple of years\nago I tried to rebuild the site with static content using\nJekyll, commonly used by\nGitHub Pages, but the effort stalled as I ran\ninto challenges with the mixture of content types we need to manage (stories,\nevents, pages, people, etc).\n\nHaving recently discovered Awestruct, a more\nversatile and sophisticated static-site generator that powers sites like\nasciidoctor.org, I ventured down that path.\n\nTo make a long story short, over the holiday break I finally pulled the trigger\nand switched jenkins-ci.org over to the new site. In fact, the page you’re\nreading right now was authored and published via our new\njenkins static site.\n\nIf you look at the bottom left-hand corner of this page\nthere is a link titled \"Improve this page\" which will take you directly to\nGitHub to edit this post!\n\nWe have many more improvements to come for the Jenkins website, which are\ntracked\nin JIRA, but for now I invite members of the Jenkins community to help curate,\ncorrect and create new blog posts and pages for jenkins-ci.org!\n\nCheck it all out on GitHub","title":"A new Jenkins website","tags":["www"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

There, as with previous years, we’ll have a table in the expo hall with plenty of\nstickers and perhaps some other forms of swag available for devotees to\ncollect.\n\nThe expo hall will be open January 23rd and January 24th, and a few Jenkins\ncontributors will be there to ask questions to, talk about CI/CD and hand out\nstickers.\n\nAdditionally, I have a presentation on\nSaturday, January 23rd titled\n\" Continuous\nDelivery of Infrastructure with Jenkins\"\n\nTalk abstract \"\"\nIn this talk we will review continuous delivery concepts and put them into\npractice by building a continuous delivery pipeline with Jenkins to test, stage\nand deploy to infrastructure code to production. Reducing the effort, error\nrate and time it takes to deploy a configuration to change to production means\nless time fighting fires and more time doing what you want.\n\"\"\n\nDuring the talk I’ll be highlighting some of the positive, and negative,\npatterns used by the Jenkins\ninfrastructure team to manage, test and deliver the Jenkins project’s own\ninfrastructure.

We’re a little late on mentioning it, but the board has allocated the money to help Jenkins contributors travel to Brussels to participate in FOSDEM and the Jenkins Contributor Summit which we will be hosting the day after, Feb 1st, which we’ll discuss more in a later blog post.\n\nFor the FOSDEM Travel Grant Program, we are able to cover up to $500 (USD) in expenses to help community members participate in FOSDEM.\n\nIf you’re interested, please read the description of the program below. Please note that some of the details of the program are different from the linked grant program page\n\nRegardless we hope to see you all at FOSDEM on January 30th and 31st, 2016, in Brussels!\n\nEligibility\n\nAll community members are eligible for support unless they’ve received a travel grant within the last year (based on the event’s date). However, as we have very limited funds to support this program, we’ll prefer applications by active contributors to the Jenkins project.\n\nIf you have other possible funding sources, please look to them first. This will allow more people to attend a Jenkins community event.\n\nApplication\n\nThe application process for FOSDEM, due to our poor timing, deviates from the traditional Travel Grant Program.\n\nTo apply for a travel grant, send an email with the following information to the Governance Board at jenkinsci-board@googlegroups.com before January 6th.\n\nYour name\n\nThe event you’d like to attend\n\nThe expected cost of travel (airfare, hotel, conference fees, etc.)\n\nA description of your contributions to the Jenkins project, such as:\n\nPlugins you developed\n\nPull requests you authored\n\nDocumentation you wrote\n\nPublic presentations on Jenkins-related topics\n\nWhy should we sponsor your trip?\n\nApplicants Responsibilities\n\nIf you’ve been selected for a travel grant, we’ll expect you to:\n\nBe available for a blog post about this program before the event.\n\nHelp out at the Jenkins stand at FOSDEM\n\nIf your schedule permits, we’d love to see you at the Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit the day after FOSDEM.\n\nIt should go without saying that we expect all Jenkins contributors representing the project at an event such as FOSDEM to act in a respectful and constructive manner. As we have not yet formally adopted our own Code of Conduct, we recommend reviewing the FOSDEM Code of Conduct.\n\nAfter the trip, please submit a travel report to jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list. This report should include the following:\n\nWhat you accomplished at the event\n\nWhat you learned at the event\n\nContacts you made\n\nOther useful information\n\nWe also expect you to submit your receipts via email to the person mentioned in the travel grant confirmation for review.
