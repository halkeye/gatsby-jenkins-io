You can check the CHANGELOG to see the features included in this release.\n\nAbout me\n\nMy name is Pham Vu Tuan, I am a final year undergraduate student from Singapore. This is the first time I participate in Google Summer of Code and contribute to an open-source organization.\n\nMentors\n\nI have GSoC mentors who help me in this project Oleg Nenashev and Supun Wanniarachchi. Besides that, I also receive great support from developers in remoting project Devin Nusbaum and Jeff Thompson.\n\nOverview\n\nCurrent versions of Jenkins Remoting are based on the TCP protocol. If it fails, the agent connection and the build fails as well. There are also issues with traffic prioritization and multi-agent communications, which impact Jenkins stability and scalability.\n\nThis project aims to develop a plugin in order to add support of a popular message queue/bus technology (Kafka) as a fault-tolerant communication layer in Jenkins.\n\nBenefits to the community\n\nProvide a new method to connect agent to controller using Kafka besides existing methods such as JNLP or SSH Build Agents plugin.\n\nHelp to resolve the existing issues with the TCP protocol between controller and agent communication in Jenkins.\n\nHelp to resolve traffic prioritization and multi-agent communications issue in Jenkins.\n\nWhy Kafka?\n\nWhen planning for this project, we want to use traditional message queue system such as ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ. However, after some discussion, we decided to have a try with Kafka with more suitable features with this project:\n\nKafka itself is not a queue like ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ, it is a distributed, replicated commit log. This helps to remove message delivery complexity we have in traditional queue system.\n\nWe need to support data streaming as a requirement, and Kafka is good at this aspect, which RabbitMQ is lack of.\n\nKafka is said to have a better scalability and good support from the development community.\n\nArchitecture Overview\n\nThe project consists of multiple components:\n\nKafka Client Library - new command transport implementation, producer and consumer client logic.\n\nRemoting Kafka Plugin - plugin implementation with KafkaGlobalConfiguration, KafkaComputerLauncher and KafkaSecretManager.\n\nRemoting Kafka Agent - A custom JAR agent with remoting JAR packaged together with a custom Engine implementation to setup a communication channel with Kafka. The agent is also packaged as a Docker image in DockerHub.\n\nAll the components are packaged together with Docker Compose.\n\nThe below diagram is the overview of the current architecture:\n\nWith this design, controller is not communicating with agent using direct TCP communication anymore, all the communication commands are transfered with Kafka.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe project is now under the third coding phase and we have some features available in 1.0 release.\n\n1. Kafka Global Configuration with support of credentials plugin to store secrets.\n\n2. Launch agent with Kafka Launcher.\n\n3. Launch agent from CLI using agent JAR with secret provided to ensure security.\n\n4. Run jobs, pipeline using Kafka agent.\n\n5. Kafka communication between controller and agent.\n\nRemoting operations are being executed over Kafka. In the log you may see:\n\nCommand execution (SlaveInstallerFactoryImpl.isWindows())\n\nClassloading (Classloader.fetch())\n\nLog streaming (Pipe.chunk())\n\nHow to run demo\n\nWe have setup a ready-to-fly demo for this plugin. You can try to run a demo of the plugin by following this instruction.\nFeatures in the demo:\n\nDocker Compose starts preconfigured controller and agent instance, they connect automatically using Kafka launcher.\n\nKafka is secured and encrypted with SSL.\n\nThere few demo jobs in the instance so that a user can launch a job on the agent.\n\nKakfa Manager supported in localhost:9000 to support monitoring of Kafka cluster.\n\nPhase 2 Presentation Slides\n\nPhase 2 Presentation Video\n\nLinks\n\nGitHub Repository\n\nWiki\n\nPlugin Site\n\nProject Info\n\nIntroduction Blogpost\n\nPhase 1 Evaluation Slides\n\nPhase 2 Evaluation Slides\n\nPhase 1 Evaluation Video\n\nPhase 2 Evaluation Video","title":"Remoting Kafka Plugin 1.0: A new method to connect agents","tags":["plugins","gsoc","gsoc2018","remoting","kafka"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/19e71/pvtuan10.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/77b35/pvtuan10.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/d4a57/pvtuan10.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/19e71/pvtuan10.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/ef6ff/pvtuan10.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/8257c/pvtuan10.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/6766a/pvtuan10.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"pvtuan10","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Pham Vu Tuan is a developer from Singapore.\nHe starts contributing to Jenkins from Google Summer of Code 2018 for <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2018/remoting-over-message-bus/\">Jenkins Remoting over Message Bus/Queue</a></p>\n</div>","id":"pvtuan10","irc":"pvtuan10","linkedin":null,"name":"Pham Vu Tuan","slug":"/blog/authors/pvtuan10","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9b44e013-999c-51f8-b612-64b922311110","slug":"/blog/2018/07/20/devops-world-jenkins-world-2018-agenda-is-live/","strippedHtml":"This year the Jenkins project introduced a few exciting efforts:\nConfiguration as Code, Jenkins X, Jenkins Evergreen, Blue Ocean and Pipeline.\nWith DevOps World-Jenkins World San Francisco and Nice only a few short months away,\nwe’ve made sure to include plenty of sessions related to these exciting efforts on the agenda.\nWith that said, the agenda for both cities is now live and will include workshops and deep dive\nsessions on these efforts and much more.\nProject contributors for these efforts will be present at both conferences as well, come say ‘hello’.\nHere’s a glimpse of what’s on the agenda:\n\nWorkshops\n\nBuilding Continuous Delivery for Microservices with Jenkins X\n\nCreating a Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins 2\n\nJenkins Administration Fundamentals\n\nJenkins Pipeline Fundamentals\n\nAnd more\n\nSessions\n\nCommon Pitfalls in Jenkins Security and How to Avoid Them –\nOleg Nenashev\n\nHabits, Tips and Tricks to Efficiently Automate Tasks with Jenkins -\nMichael Paillloncy\n\nSafely Upgrading Jenkins Everyday -

We’ve started documenting the capabilities that are available\ntoday and will continue as more become available.\n\nCredit: thanks to tracymiranda for the image\n\nUse version control for all artifacts\n\nThe Weaveworks folks coined the term GitOps which we love.  Any change to an environment, whether it be a new application,\nversion upgrade, resource limit change or simple application configuration should be raised as a Pull Request to Git, have\nchecks run against it like a form of CI for environments and approved by a team that has control over what goes into the\nrelated environment.  We can now enable governance and have full traceability for any change to an environment.\n\nRelated Accelerate capability:  Use version control for all production artifacts\n\nAutomate your deployment process\n\nEnvironments\n\nJenkins X will automatically create Git backed environments during installation and makes it easy to add new ones using\njx create environment.  Additionally when creating new applications via a quickstart ( jx create quickstart), Java based\nSpringBoot ( jx create spring) or importing existing applications ( jx import), Jenkins X will both automatically add\nCI / CD pipelines and setup the jobs, git repos and webhooks to enable an automated deployment process.\n\nOut of the box Jenkins X creates Staging and Production (this is customisable) permanent environments as well as temporary\nenvironments for preview applications from Pull Requests.\n\nPreviews Environments\n\nWe are trying to move as much testing, security, validation and experimentation for a change before it’s merged to master.\nWith the use of temporary dynamically created Preview Environments any pull request can have a preview version built and\ndeployed, including libraries that feed into a downstream deployable application.  This means we can code review, test,\ncollaborate better with all teams that are involved in agreeing that change can go live.\n\nUltimately Jenkins X wants to provide a way that developers, testers, designers and product managers can be as sure as they\ncan that when a change is merged to master it works as expected.  We want to be confident the proposed change does not\nnegatively affect any service or feature as well as deliver the value it is intended to.\n\nWhere Preview Environments get really interesting is when we are able to progress a PR through various stages of maturity and\nconfidence where we begin to direct a percentage of real production traffic like beta users to it.  We can then analyse the\nvalue of the proposed change and possible run multiple automated experiments over time using Hypothesis Driven Development.\nThis helps give us better understanding of how the change will perform when released to all users.\n\nRelated Accelerate capability: Foster and enable team experimentation\n\nUsing preview environments is a great way to introduce better test automation.  While Jenkins X enables this we don’t yet\nhave examples of automated tests being run against a preview environment.  A simple test would be to ensure the application\nstarts ok and Kubernetes liveness check pass for an amount of time. This relates to\n\nRelated Accelerate capability: Implement Test Automation\nRelated Accelerate capability: Automate your deployment process\n\nPermanent Environments\n\nIn software development we’re used to working with multiple environments in the lead up to a change being promoted to a live\nproduction environment.  Whilst this seems business as usual it can cause significant delays to other changes if for any\nreason that it is deemed not fit via some process that didn’t happen pre merge to master.  Subsequent commits then become\nblocked and can cause delay of urgent changes being promoted to production.\n\nAs above Jenkins X wants any changes and experiments to be validated before it is merged to master.  We would like changes in\na staging environment to be held there for a short amount of time before being promoted, ideally in an automated fashion.\n\nThe default Jenkins X pipelines provide deployment automation via environments.  These are customisable to suite your own\nCI / CD pipeline requirements.\n\nJenkins X recommends Staging should act as a near as possible reflection on production, ideally with real production data\nshadowed to it using a service mesh to understand the behaviour.  This also helps when developing changes in preview where we\ncan link to non production services in staging.\n\nRelated Accelerate capability: Automate your deployment process\n\nUse trunk-based development\n\nThe Accelerate book found that teams which use trunk based development with short lived branches performed better.  This has\nalways worked for the Jenkins X core team members so this was an easy capability for Jenkins X to implement when setting up\nGit repositories and CI/CD jobs.\n\nImplement Continuous Integration\n\nJenkins X sees CI as the effort of validating a proposed change via pull requests before it is merged to controller.  Jenkins X\nwill automatically configure source code repositories, Jenkins and Kubernetes to provide Continuous Integration of the box.\n\nImplement Continuous Delivery\n\nJenkins X sees CD as the effort of taking that change after it’s been merged to controller through to running in a live\nenvironment.  Jenkins X automates many parts in a release pipeline:\n\nJenkins X advocates the use of semantic versioning.  We use git tags to calculate the next release version which means we\ndon’t need to store the latest release version in the controller branch.  Where release systems do store the last or next version\nin Git repos it means CD becomes hard, as a commit in a release pipeline back to controller triggers a new release.  This results\nin a recursive release trigger.  Using a Git tag helps avoid this situation which Jenkins X completely automates.\n\nJenkins X will automatically create a released version on every merge to master which can then potentially progress\nthrough to production.\n\nUse loosely coupled architecture\n\nBy targeting Kubernetes users of Jenkins X can take advantage of many of the cloud features that help design and develop\nloosely coupled solutions.  Service discovery, fault tolerance, scalability, health checks, rolling upgrades, container\nscheduling and orchestration to name just a few examples of where Kubernetes helps.\n\nArchitect for empowered teams\n\nJenkins X aims to help polyglot application developers.  Right now Jenkins X has quickstarts and automated CI/CD setup with\nlanguage detection for Golang, Java, NodeJS, .Net, React, Angular, Rust, Swift and more to come.  What this also does is\nprovide a consistent Way of Working so developers can concentrate on developing.\n\nJenkins X also provides many addons, for example Grafana and Prometheus for automated metrics collection and visualisation.\nIn this example centralised metrics help understand how your applications behave when built and deployed on Kubernetes.\n\nDevPods are another feature which enables developers to edit source code in their\nlocal IDE, behind the scenes it is then synced to the cloud and rapidly built and redeployed.\n\nJenkins X believes providing developers automation that helps them experiment in the cloud, with different technologies and\nfeedback empowers them to make the best decisions - faster.\n\nFancy a closer look?\n\nMyself, James Strachan and\nRob Davies are going to be presenting and running workshops at\nDevOps World  | Jenkins World.  We’ll also be hanging out at the Jenkins X demo\narea so come and say hello and see what’s the latest cool and exiting things to come out of Jenkins X.  Use JWFOSS for 30%\ndiscount off registration\n\nWant to get involved?\n\nJenkins X is open source, the community mainly hangs out in the\nJenkins X Kubernetes slack channels and for tips on being more involved with Jenkins X\ntake a look at our contributing docs.  We’ve been helping lots of folks get into open source, learn\nnew technoligies and languages like golang.  Why not get involved?\n\nDemo\n\nIf you’ve not already seen it here’s a video showing a spring boot quickstart with automatic CI/CD pipelines and preview environments.","title":"Accelerate with Jenkins X","tags":["jenkinsx","developer","kubernetes"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8e8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/8f3e9e2f521cb211e3ccac77dc47d04f/19e71/jrawlings.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/8f3e9e2f521cb211e3ccac77dc47d04f/77b35/jrawlings.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/8f3e9e2f521cb211e3ccac77dc47d04f/d4a57/jrawlings.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/8f3e9e2f521cb211e3ccac77dc47d04f/19e71/jrawlings.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/8f3e9e2f521cb211e3ccac77dc47d04f/68974/jrawlings.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/8f3e9e2f521cb211e3ccac77dc47d04f/ef6ff/jrawlings.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/8f3e9e2f521cb211e3ccac77dc47d04f/8257c/jrawlings.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/8f3e9e2f521cb211e3ccac77dc47d04f/6766a/jrawlings.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/8f3e9e2f521cb211e3ccac77dc47d04f/22bfc/jrawlings.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"rawlingsj","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>James has a passion for continuous delivery and software automation in general.

Users should be able to\nconfigure job type using YAML file placed in root directory of the\nGit repository being the subject of the pull request. The plugin should interact with various\nplatforms like Bitbucket, Github, Gitlab, etc whenever a pull request is created or updated.\n\nPlugin detects the presence of certain types of reports at conventional locations,\nand publish them automatically.

It supports all features of Multi-Branch Pipeline and offers the following features.\n\nBuild description is defined via YAML file stored within the SCM repo. This plugin\nwill depend on GitHub plugin, Bitbucket plugin, Gitlab plugin if users will be\nusing respective platforms for their repositories.\n\nConversion of YAML to Declarative Pipeline: A class YamlToPipeline\nis written which will load the \"Jenkinsfile.yaml\" and make use of PipelineSnippetGenerator class\nto generate Declarative pipeline code.\n\nReporting of results, only xml report types is supported for now.\n\nUse of Yaml file (Jenkinsfile.yaml) from target branch.\n\nGit Push step: To push the changes of pull request to the target branch. This is implemented\nusing git-plugin, PushCommand is used for this from git-plugin. credentialId,\nbranch name and repository url for interacting with Github, Bitbucket, etc\nwill be taken automatically from \"Branch-Source\" (Users have to fill this\ndetails of branch source in job configuration UI). (You can see\nHow to run the demo)\n\nStepConfigurator: To generate pipeline code for all supported steps in Jenkins. This is using\nJenkins configuration-as-code plugin (JCasC plugin) to configure a particular step object and\nthen that step object is passed to Snippetizer.object2Groovy() method to generate the script of that step.\n\nJenkinsfile.yaml example\n\nFor the phase 1 prototype demonstration, the following yaml file was used.\nNote that this format is subject to change in the next phases of the project,\nas we formalise the yaml format definition.\n\n#  Docker image agent example\nagent:\n label: my_label\n customWorkspace: path_to_workspace\n dockerImage: maven:3-alpine\n args: -v /tmp:/tmp\n\n  tools:\n    maven : maven_3.0.1\n    jdk : jdk8\n\nconfiguration:\n  # Push PR changes to the target branch if the build succeeds.\n  # default value is false\n  pushPrOnSuccess: false\n\n  # Trusted user to approve pull requests\n  prApprovers:\n    - username1\n    - username2\n    - username3\n\nenvironment:\n  variables:\n    variable_1: value_1\n    variable_2: value_2\n\n  # Credentials contains only two fields. credentialId must be present in the Jenkins Credentials\n  credentials:\n    - credentialId : fileCredentialId\n      variable : FILE\n\n      # In user scripts Username and Password can be accessed by LOGIN_USR and LOGIN_PSW\n      # respectively as environment variales\n    - credentialId : dummyGitRepo\n      variable : LOGIN\n\nstages:\n  - name: stage1\n    agent: any\n    steps:\n      - sh: \"scripts/hello\"\n      - sleep:\n          time: 2\n          unit: SECONDS\n      - sleep: 2\n      - junit:\n          testResults: \"target/**.xml\"\n          allowEmptyResults: true\n          testDataPublishers:\n            - AutomateTestDataPublisher\n            - JunitResultPublisher:\n                urlOverride: \"urlOverride\"\n    # Post section for \"stage1\".

The GreatOps community, event host, invited John Willis, a thought leader of DevOps to deliver the keynote speech. John’s topic was \"DevOps: Almost 10 years - What A  Strange Long Trip It’s Been.\" It was very insightful to learn of the history of DevOps and John’s point of view on the practice.\n\nLily Lin from Micro Focus presented, \"How to practice CI/CD for large-scale micro service based on Jenkins Pipeline.\"\n\nJames Rawlings, one of the core Jenkins X contributors traveled from the United Kingdom to present, \"Jenkins X for the future, Easy CI/CD for Kubernetes.\"\n\nAfter James’ presentation, there were many questions about Jenkins X, Jenkins users in China are very interested in Jenkins X.

If it fails, the agent connection and the build fails as well. There are also issues with traffic prioritization and multi-agent communications, which impact Jenkins stability and scalability.\n\nRemoting Kafka Plugin is a plugin developed under Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2018. The plugin is developed to add support of a popular message queue/bus technology (Kafka) as a fault-tolerant communication layer in Jenkins. A quick introduction of the project can be found in this introduction blogpost.\n\nHow to use the plugin?\n\nThe instructions to run the plugin in alpha version are written here.
