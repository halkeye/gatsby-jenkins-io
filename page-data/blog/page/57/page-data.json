This will allow more people to attend a Jenkins community event.\n\nApplication\n\nThe application process for FOSDEM, due to our poor timing, deviates from the traditional Travel Grant Program.\n\nTo apply for a travel grant, send an email with the following information to the Governance Board at jenkinsci-board@googlegroups.com before January 6th.\n\nYour name\n\nThe event you’d like to attend\n\nThe expected cost of travel (airfare, hotel, conference fees, etc.)\n\nA description of your contributions to the Jenkins project, such as:\n\nPlugins you developed\n\nPull requests you authored\n\nDocumentation you wrote\n\nPublic presentations on Jenkins-related topics\n\nWhy should we sponsor your trip?\n\nApplicants Responsibilities\n\nIf you’ve been selected for a travel grant, we’ll expect you to:\n\nBe available for a blog post about this program before the event.\n\nHelp out at the Jenkins stand at FOSDEM\n\nIf your schedule permits, we’d love to see you at the Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit the day after FOSDEM.\n\nIt should go without saying that we expect all Jenkins contributors representing the project at an event such as FOSDEM to act in a respectful and constructive manner. As we have not yet formally adopted our own Code of Conduct, we recommend reviewing the FOSDEM Code of Conduct.\n\nAfter the trip, please submit a travel report to jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list. This report should include the following:\n\nWhat you accomplished at the event\n\nWhat you learned at the event\n\nContacts you made\n\nOther useful information\n\nWe also expect you to submit your receipts via email to the person mentioned in the travel grant confirmation for review.

Kishore works for CloudBees, building custom frameworks with Open Source software and helping customers solve engineering problems around continuous delivery and DevOps at scale.\n\nThis year some great new Jenkins features came out of the butler’s goodie bag - amongst them, the most important one being the ability to realize continuous delivery pipeline as code!\nThe features like Workflow Multibranch, pipeline-as-code (with a marker file that Jenkins looks for in your application’s SCM repository/branch, aptly named Jenkinsfile) are the foundations to making Jenkins super intelligent to automagically create workflows (rather, a CI/CD pipeline) to build your code and orchestrate the work required to drive your application from concept to delivery!\n\nOverview\n\nThe Workflow Multibranch feature (provided by the workflow plugin) provides the following key abilities:\n\nAutomatic Workflow (job) creation in Jenkins per new branch in the repo (assuming webhooks are registered from GH to Jenkins).\n\nBuild specific to that child-branch and its unique scm change and build history.\n\nAutomatic job pruning/deletion for branches deleted from the repository, according to the settings.\n\nFlexibility to individually configure branch properties, by overriding the parent properties, if required.\n\nJenkins pipeline-as-code (concept) enables you to maintain your CI/CD workflow logic in the project/application source code repo with no additional configuration to be maintained per branch in Jenkins.\n\nThe Workflow script to build/test/deploy your code is always synchronized with the rest of the source code you are working on.\n\nTo demonstrate the concept here - Let’s use a basic Java Web application project with a Maven pom.xml as shown in the structure below (this is using GitHub as the SCM but you can do this on SVN or Mercurial too).\n\nThis project has a marker file for Jenkins in the repo - Jenkinsfile. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic1.png\n\nSo, what’s a Jenkinsfile? The Jenkinsfile is essentially your Jenkins Workflow, a script, that defines the CI/CD pipeline logic for a project with steps to build/test/deploy etc. captured in various stages.\n\nSo for our sample Java web application, a basic Jenkinsfile could be something like -\n\nnode {\n   // Mark the code checkout 'stage'....\n   stage 'Checkout'\n\n   // Checkout code from repository\n   checkout scm\n\n   // Get the maven tool.\n   // ** NOTE: This 'M3' maven tool must be configured\n   // **       in the global configuration.\n   def mvnHome = tool 'M3'\n\n   // Mark the code build 'stage'....\n   stage 'Build'\n   // Run the maven build\n   sh \"${mvnHome}/bin/mvn clean install\"\n}\n\nJust having this file in the source code repo root would mean that -\n\nJenkins will automatically recognize this branch and create appropriate jobs by itself.\n\nQuick, 1-step code checkout using: “checkout scm” in your workflow\n\nEvery time a new change is pushed to this branch, the branch is built and the commit status gets updated.\n\nWhen the branch is destroyed in the repository, or if Jenkinsfile is removed, the corresponding job gets destroyed from Jenkins automatically ( You can retain these jobs and/or archive the builds for audit/compliance requirements using the retention property - Orphan Item strategy)\n\nthere are various mechanisms to promote reuse of Workflow scripts, such as the Workflow Global Library.\n\nRequired Jenkins configuration\n\nMake sure you’ve the latest Workflow and (v1.11 as of writing this blog) Workflow Multibranch plugins installed on your Jenkins instance image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic2.png\n\nAlso, ensure that other dependencies, like SCM plugins and build tools, are met:\n\nEither SVN/Git/Mercurial (depending on your SCM)\n\nGitHub Branch Source Plugin (optimized to use the GitHub API and improve performance)\n\nMaven build tool\n\nFinally, make sure you’ve created the required Webhook from your SCM (Github in this case) to Jenkins.\nHere’s how to do that:\n\nSetting up GitHub Webhooks in Jenkins\n\nStep-by-step guide to setting up Jenkins for GitHub projects\n\nThen create a new Multibranch Workflow Job with configuration as shown below - mainly selecting the Branch Sources (Git, in this example) and providing the branch/repo URL with credentials.\n\nBranch sources (Git) - https://github.com/kishorebhatia/pipeline-as-code-demo (or a repo where you’ve cloned this source code with Jenkinsfile)\n\nLeave all other properties default and Save. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic3.png\n\nYou’ll observe that Jenkins would perform Branch Indexing on that “cd” job folder and start the workflow for the master branch, with an automatically created new job, named master, under the “cd” folder.\n\nThe workflow does a dummy step for application deploys to the environments in this sequence Staging -> Waits for manual approval -> PROD\n\nNow, let’s create a new branch off of this master branch in your cloned git repo:\n\n$ git branch newBranch (create a newBranch)\n\n$ git checkout newBranch (switches to newBranch)\n\n$ git push --set-upstream origin newBranch (pushes newBranch)\n\nYou’ll observe that your Jenkins instance automatically picks up this newBranch and starts running the workflow (with the Jenkinsfile in this newBranch) to build/test/deploy the code. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic4.png\n\nNext, if you now delete this newBranch ( git branch -D newBranch), Jenkins will automatically remove the orphan Workflow job for newBranch. You can retain these jobs even after the branches are deleted using the Orphaned Item Strategy property in the main \"cd\" job’s configuration.\n\nSo we observed the following benefits of this pipeline-as-code approach:\n\nOverall job definition is a script (Jenkinsfile)\n\nCalls your build tools and scripts for details\n\nThe build script can be versioned alongside project sources\n\nJenkins handles feature/experimental branches automatically\n\nKeep less configuration in $JENKINS_HOME\n\nDockerized Demo environment\n\nYou can also use the following docker image to run this demo with a preconfigured Jenkins environment and the sample job: jenkinsci/workflow-demo (i.e. docker pull jenkinsci/workflow-demo)\n\nThis docker container includes Jenkins with Workflow and Workflow Multibranch plugins, a local git repo with the aforementioned Java web application and Jetty to demonstrate a continuous delivery pipeline of this application deployed and tested across multiple environments in the pipeline with an approval gate before promoting to PROD (like QA, Staging and PROD).\n\nThere’s a \"cd\" job pre-configured as a multibranch Workflow job.\n\nLaunch the docker demo as: docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 9418:9418 -ti jenkinsci/workflow-demo\n\nNow, you can access Jenkins on port 8080 and Jetty on port 8081 from localhost or the IP of your boot2docker/docker-machine environment.\n\nThe demo container has a local git repo so you can clone: git://localhost/repo. When creating new branches, each branch automatically creates a matching subproject in Jenkins and triggers the build for that branch. The workflow:\n\nChecks out source code from the same repository and commit as Jenkinsfile.\n\nBuilds sources via Maven with unit testing.\n\nRuns two parallel integration tests that involve deploying the app to ephemeral server instances, which get thrown away when tests are done (this is done by using auto-deployment of Jetty)\n\nOnce integration tests are successful, the webapp gets to the staging server at localhost:8081/staging (or your docker-machine/boot2docker instance IP)\n\nrequires a human to Manually inspect the staging instance, and when ready, approves the deployment to the production server at http://localhost:8081/production/\n\nReferences\n\nDeveloper blog by jglick introducing multibranch support\n\nworkflow plugin tutorial\n\nworkflow plugin presentations\n\nworkflow plugin demo readme","title":"Pipeline-as-code with Multibranch Workflows in Jenkins","tags":["general","guest post","tutorial","pipeline","workflow"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
