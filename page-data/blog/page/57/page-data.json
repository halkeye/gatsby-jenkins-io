For example, I could not\nfind a solution which gives me the possibility to easily decide which data\nshould be display in the widget and which not. It also doesn`t have the\npossibility to add additional widgets to the dashboard which have nothing to do\nwith Jenkins. So I came up with something interesting that includes Jenkins\ndata. But I cannot do that with the existing built-in dashboards from Jenkins\nplugins which are Jenkins-content specific.\n\nSo I decided to write a new, flexible and extensible dashboard. To avoid\nre-inventing the wheel I also decided to use\ndashing-js as a basis and not\nJenkins itself. dashing-js is a Node.js port of\nDashing, a Sinatra -based\nframework that lets you build beautiful dashboards.\n\nThe key features of Dashing are:\n\nUse pre-made widgets, or fully create your own with Sass, HTML and CoffeeScript\n\nWidgets harness the power of data bindings (via batman.js) to keep things DRY and simple\n\nUse the API to push data to your dashboards or make use of a simple Node.js script for fetching data\n\nDrag & drop interface for re-arranging your widgets\n\nThe advantage over a native Java-based Jenkins plugin is that you don’t need to\nknow Java and the whole Java stack. You can also easily add other pre-made\nthird-party widgets, for example a GitHub Pull Request count widget or an AWS\nstatistic widget or whatever else. In other words, it is completely independent\nof Jenkins. All you need is Node.js and the permission to access the\nJenkins API.\n\nBeside dashing-js you will need my\nJenkins Job widget. It is a\ngeneric widget for Jenkins jobs which provides a highly visible view of the\nbuild status and build progress of selected Jenkins jobs. Via configuration it\nis possible to add multiple widgets for different Jenkins jobs (as you can see\nin the screenshot below).\n\nSo, all you need is dashing-js, my Jenkins Job widget and some\nnpm packages.  The installation and the setup is really\neasy and can be found here.\n\nExample","title":"A beautiful Jenkins dashboard","tags":["dashboard"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"http://blog.kj187.de","github":"kj187","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Julian Kleinhans is working as a Software Architect at <a href=\"https://www.aoe.com\">AOE GmbH</a> in Krefeld.\nBeside his passion as a developer, he is also passionate about whiskey.\nHis blog deals with various topics such as web development and whisky tasting.</p>\n</div>","id":"kj187","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Julian Kleinhans","slug":"/blog/authors/kj187","twitter":"kj187"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","id":"89aaaaa5-cde6-5023-9381-353a81e305b6","slug":"/blog/2016/01/07/official-code-of-conduct/","strippedHtml":"Over the past couple months, we have been working on a long overdue\nCode of Conduct for the Jenkins project (meeting minutes\nhere\nand\nhere).\nFollowing in the footsteps of other projects like the\nApache Software\nFoundation, Go lang and\ncountless others, we have adopted this\ncode of conduct to help set guidelines for what behaviors are acceptable, and\nwhat behaviors are not, when acting within the Jenkins community or on behalf\nof the Jenkins project.\n\nI would like to extend our gratitude to the authors of\nthe Contributor Covenant who provided us\nwith a very good and mostly finished Code of Conduct template.

Like Jenkins itself, Drupal is easy to set up, install\nplugins and authoring content is done in a web UI. For the past seven years Drupal\nhas served us well, but it is time to move on to something better suited for our needs.\n\nThe general requirements for something newer were:\n\nEasy to edit and create content\n\nChanges to content should be tracked and reviewable\n\nAny Jenkins contributor should be able to participate\n\nSupport mixed content types\n\nThe consensus was that a statically-generated site, with raw content hosted on\nGitHub, would meet the majority of the \"ease-of-use\" type requirements. The\nremainder could be addressed depending on the implementation. A couple of years\nago I tried to rebuild the site with static content using\nJekyll, commonly used by\nGitHub Pages, but the effort stalled as I ran\ninto challenges with the mixture of content types we need to manage (stories,\nevents, pages, people, etc).\n\nHaving recently discovered Awestruct, a more\nversatile and sophisticated static-site generator that powers sites like\nasciidoctor.org, I ventured down that path.\n\nTo make a long story short, over the holiday break I finally pulled the trigger\nand switched jenkins-ci.org over to the new site. In fact, the page you’re\nreading right now was authored and published via our new\njenkins static site.\n\nIf you look at the bottom left-hand corner of this page\nthere is a link titled \"Improve this page\" which will take you directly to\nGitHub to edit this post!\n\nWe have many more improvements to come for the Jenkins website, which are\ntracked\nin JIRA, but for now I invite members of the Jenkins community to help curate,\ncorrect and create new blog posts and pages for jenkins-ci.org!\n\nCheck it all out on GitHub","title":"A new Jenkins website","tags":["www"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
