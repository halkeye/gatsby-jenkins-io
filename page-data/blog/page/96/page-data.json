When I sat down to write the inaugural post, Welcome to Continuous Blog, I set forth a few goals:\n\nHelp advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community\n\nBe a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson users of all skill-levels\n\nRecognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their efforts\n\nBeing a community resource, I wanted to review our progress on those goals along with some other interesting details about Continuous Blog and my community efforts. My metrics for achieving these goals are largely based on web traffic to this blog and retweets via the @hudsonci twitter account. First a minor overview of some of Continuous Blog’s traffic, then I’ll get to reviewing the goals.\n\nVisitor trend via Google Analytics\n\nOver the past month Continuous Blog has seen just under 10,000 visits from a number of different sources, the top sources being:\n\nFeedburner links posted to @hudsonci\n\nDirect visits\n\nFeedburner\n\nReferrals from the \"blog\" link on hudson-ci.org\n\nreddit\n\nLinks from the Java.net community portal and associated weblogs\n\nIn addition to general web traffic, Continuous Blog has around 350 RSS subscribers.\n\nTo put these numbers into perspective, Hudson has seen commits from 173 different developers and the @hudsonci twitter account has about 1,100 followers.\n\nHudson Advocacy\n\nLooking at the traffic sources and the volume of traffic coming from what I would consider \"the wider internet community\" I’d say I failed to meet my own expectations. The majority of traffic seems to be coming from \"within the community\", which is certainly not a bad thing by a stretch, but I was hoping to start to see more visitors who are less likely to be using Hudson already. There are signs of this (I think) in the low number of search referrals, roughly 370 visits. To me this indicates the early age of this site, small number of external links to Continuous Blog and the content isn’t \"interesting\" enough to come up in searches for terms like \"continuous integration with python\".\n\nThe vector for improvement in advocacy, in my opinion, is to focus more on tutorials and user guides in the next month. Mike Rooney’s post on Keeping your configuration and data in Subversion was both discussion provoking, but one of the more visited pages over the past month. I’ll be reaching out to more power-users from differing backgrounds to try to get some more tutorials on using Hudson for Python, Ruby, and Cocoa development while continuing to bug some of you Maven2 pros about guides.\n\nCentral information repository\n\nI feel I failed to meet my own expectations here as well, it has only been a month (feels like an eternity!) so the amount of information we’ve been able to aggregate is small, but growing.\n\nI have likely spent too much time covering Hudson community news, which I feel is important, to put a human voice in front of commits and releases, but it is not what I originally intended to spend the majority of my time doing.\n\nRecognition of contributors\n\nIn my opinion, this goal I’ve met. When writing up each Hudson release I’ve made certain to give credit where credit is due, to those that contributed, Through the \"spotlight\" series of posts I’ve also made an effort to highlight power-users of Hudson, trying to glean interesting details about their installations from them for our benefit. Unfortunately I’ve done a poor job highlighting the contributions from individual plugin developers, something I’m still not certain how to correct.\n\nContent\n\nIf you’ve been following the blog you have no doubt noticed the regular occurrence of certain types of posts, these regular series are:\n\n\"This Week in Plugins\"\n\nThis post is halfway script generated, pulling all the release details out of SVN history to help me generate a post. The intention of the post being to cite new or notable plugins, while giving an informative listing of \"what’s happening\" in plugin development for the past week.\n\n\"Spotlight On\"\n\nThe only interview-formatted series I’ve got going right now, I’ve been trying to find companies or organizations who are using Hudson in interesting ways and are willing to let \"us\" peek behind the curtains a bit. This started more from curiosity, but I think it’s fun to let Hudson users brag about their set ups.\n\nHudson 1.xxx Released\n\nPretty straight-forward reporting on a release of Hudson, depending on the contents of the release there may be some calls to action or editorializing on what’s gone into the release.\n\nLinks for\n\nRoll-up of links shared or retweeted via the @hudsonci account, uncertain whether this is worth the time spent.\n\nMy two questions to the community in general would be:\n\nDo you dislike any of these?\n\nWhat else would you like to see on a regular basis?\n\nI’m certainly open to suggestion, I’d like Continuous Blog to continue to be interesting to the Hudson community and if certain kinds of posts are boring or uninteresting, I can cut them from the line-up.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe largest challenge of Continuous Blog is time. As it stands the majority of content I write or edit in some capacity, which is a larger amount of time than I expected to spend. All said and done it takes me between 6-10 hours a week to write for CB, keep tabs on @hudsonci and peruse the mailing list for interesting things. This probably isn’t maintainable, and if for some reason a bus hits me ( not uncommon around here), this blog would go dark for a while.\n\nThis can be easily fixed by simply adding more contributors to the blog, I’ll post more on how to write for Continuous Blog in another post.\n\nAll said and done, I am looking forward to another month of writing and following the Hudson community. I’m grateful for all those who’ve asked questions, been interviewed, wrote content and participated in discussion in the comments. For those of you in the Bay Area, I do hope you come out for the meet-up in mid-March, for the rest of you, I’ll catch you on IRC :)","title":"One month of Continuous Blog","tags":["core"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

That’s nearly two whole days of Hudson!\n\nDay One (Mar. 19)\n\nThe first day of the hackathon/meetup is aimed primarily at those working with Hudson’s core, or are building on top of Hudson (plugins, etc).\n\nStart: 10 a.m.\n\nEnd: 5 p.m.\n\nLocation: Oracle Santa Clara campus in the \"library\" conference room of SCA7 \"Mansion\" building.\n\nThere will a number of community and corporate Hudson hackers joining us on Friday, so bring everything you’ll need to get some grade A hacking done with Kohsuke, Andrew Bayer, Alan Harder and your fellow plugin hackers.\n\nDay Two (Mar. 20)\n\nI’m tentatively calling this the main event, which will be hosted at the delightful Hacker Dojo in Mountain View. The \"main event\" will carry over the hackathon from the day before at Oracle, into a full blown community hackathon and meet-up.

As such, I’m hoping to get a lot of folks interested in using Hudson to come to Hacker Dojo where we (already being Hudson users) can help get them up to speed with all the great things Hudson can do.\n\nIf you’re interested please RSVP:\n\nVia the hackathon page on the wiki\n\nVia Facebook for day one and day two\n\nHow you can help\n\nWhile I casually refer to myself as a \"PR intern\" for Kohsuke, I’m technically a busy software engineer, meaning I’m grateful for all the help I can get.\n\nGet the word out\n\nThe best way to help get the word out is to talk about Hudson and the meetup, this includes:\n\nLink to this post on Twitter\n\nPing any user groups you are a member of in the area\n\nBlog about it\n\nLet your co-workers know about it\n\nAttend!\n\nVolunteer to help setup/teardown\n\nHosting the Saturday event at Hacker Dojo does carry some responsibilities with it. We will need some extra hands to make sure everybody has power, refreshments are chilled, lunch is ordered and delivered, and of course, cleaning up after we leave. If you’re in a generous mood, or in a real need for some karma, sign up to help on the bottom of the wiki page\n\nI am hoping Oracle and some other heavy users/contributors will kick in a few bucks for lunch and drinks on Saturday, if you think your company can help us out, feel free to ping me directly at tyler at linux.com.","title":"Meet-up and Hack alongside Kohsuke and Co.","tags":["feedback","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
