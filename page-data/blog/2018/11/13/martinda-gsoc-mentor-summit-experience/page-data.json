The Mentor Summit is an unconference\nwhere participants are invited to fill empty time slots with their own topic of discussion.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"friday-oct-12\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#friday-oct-12\"></a>Friday Oct 12</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"pre-conference-meeting\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#pre-conference-meeting\"></a>Pre-conference meeting</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The mentors had a short pre-conference meeting to reflect on the Jenkins participation in the 2018 GSoC program,\nand to plan for 2019.\nWe were joined at this meeting by Lloyd Chang, whom we had met at Jenkins World 2018.\nThank you Lloyd for joining us! A few ideas we had for 2019 are:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Move project proposals to individual Google Documents</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a template for project proposed by potential mentors and by project champions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create an Organization Administrator Guide for future Jenkins GSoC project admins</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Other preparations we agreed to work on include a review of the 2018 feedback and the creation\nof an <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-54059\">Epic</a> capturing the action items in preparation for 2019.\nWe are also planning on making progress on the GSoC Budget process described in <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/8\">JEP-8</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"summit-starts\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#summit-starts\"></a>Summit Starts!</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The summit started by a welcoming dinner at the Google Cafeteria and an evening session\nwhere we were explained how the unconference would work.

An interesting session was \"Beyond GSoC, What can Google do?\".\nOne person got a big round of applause when he said: \"Cloud credits\".

Google may be big and powerful, but some things\nare hard and remain hard in the corporate world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>An interesting suggestion was made by Oleg, and it would be to have a program with smaller, shorter term\ncommitments, something that would encourage more granular contributions but would not require a 4-month\nlong commitment.
