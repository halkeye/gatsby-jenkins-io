It&#8217;s all automated for you out of the box! So you can focus instead on delivering value!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At the same time, Jenkins X doesn&#8217;t hide anything. If you do want to hack the <code>Dockerfile</code>, <code>Jenkinsfile</code> or Helm charts for your apps or their environments then go right ahead - those are all available versioned in git with the rest of your source code with full CI/CD on it all. GitOps FTW!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins X automates CI/CD and DevOps best practices for you - so you can become a faster performing team!

The default environments are <em>Staging</em> and <em>Production</em> but teams can create as many environments as they wish and call them whatever they prefer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>An Environment is a place to deploy code and each Environment maps to a separate <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/\">namespace in Kubernetes</a> so they are isolated from each other and can be managed independently.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We use something called <em>GitOps</em> to manage environments and perform <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/about/features/#promotion\">promotion</a>. This means that:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Each environment gets its own git repository to store all the environment specific configuration together with a list of all the applications and their version and configuration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Promotion of new versions of applications to an environment results in:</p>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a Pull Request is created for the configuration change that triggers the CI pipeline tests on the Environment along with code review and approval</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>once the Pull Request is merged the release pipeline for the environment which updates the applications running in that environment by applying the helm chart metadata from the git repository.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Environments can be configured to either promote <em>automatically</em> as part of a release pipeline or they can use <em>manual</em> promotion.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The defaults today are for the <em>Staging</em> environment to use automatic promotion; so all merges to master are automatically promoted to Staging. Then the <em>Production</em> environment is configured to use manual promotion; so you choose when do promote.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However it is easy to change the  configuration of how many environments you need and how they are configured via the <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_create_environment/\">jx create environment</a> and <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_edit_environment/\">jx edit environment</a> commands</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"preview-environments\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#preview-environments\"></a>Preview Environments</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins X lets you create <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/about/features/#preview-environments\">Preview Environments</a> for Pull Requests. Typically this happens automatically in the Pull Request Pipelines when a Pull Request is submitted but you can also perform this manually yourself via the <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/developing/preview/\">jx preview</a> command.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The following happens when a Preview Environment is created:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a new <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/about/features/#environments\">Environment</a> of kind <code>Preview</code> is created along with a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/\">kubernetes namespace</a> which show up the <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_get_environments/\">jx get environments</a> command along with the <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/developing/kube-context/\">jx environment and jx namespace commands</a> so you can see which preview environments are active and switch into them to look around</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the Pull Request is built as a preview docker image and chart and deployed into the preview environment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a comment is added to the Pull Request to let your team know the preview application is ready for testing with a link to open the application. So in one click your team members can try out the preview!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/jenkins-x/intro/pr-comment.png\" alt=\"Issue Comment\" width=\"800\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is particularly useful if you are working on a web application or REST endpoint; it lets your team interact with the running Pull Request to help folks approve changes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"feedback\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#feedback\"></a>Feedback</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If the commit comments reference issues (e.g. via the text <code>fixes #123</code>) then Jenkins X pipelines will generate release notes like those of <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases\">the jx releases</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Also, as the version associated with those new commits is promoted to <code>Staging</code> or <code>Production</code>, you will get automated comments on each fixed issue that the issue is now available for review in the corresponding environment along with a link to the release notes and a link to the app running in that environment. e.g.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/jenkins-x/intro/issue-comment.png\" alt=\"Issue Comment\" width=\"800\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#getting-started\"></a>Getting started</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hopefully you now want to give Jenkins X a try. One of the great features of Jenkins is that it&#8217;s super easy to get started: install Java, download a war and run via <code>java -jar jenkins.war</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>With Jenkins X we&#8217;ve tried to follow a similarly simple experience. One complication is that Jenkins X has more moving pieces than a single JVM; it also needs a Kubernetes cluster :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>First you need to <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/install/\">download and install the jx command line tool</a> so its on your <code>PATH</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Then you need to run a single command to <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/create-cluster/\">create a new Kubernetes cluster and install Jenkins X</a> (in this example, on GKE).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight nowrap\"><code>jx create cluster gke</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Today we support creating Kubernetes clusters and installing Jenkins X on Amazon (AWS), Google (GKE), Microsoft Azure, and even locally using minikube.\nWe plan to support AWS EKS soon.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At the time of this writing the easiest cloud to get started with is Google&#8217;s GKE so we recommend you start there unless you already use AWS or Azure. Amazon and Microsoft are working hard to make Kubernetes clusters as easy to create and manage as they are on GKE.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>All the public clouds have a free tier so you should be able to spin up a Kubernetes cluster and install Jenkins X for a few hours then tear it down and it should be cheaper than a cup of coffee (probably free!). Just remember to tear down the cluster when you are done!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ELA4tytdFeA\">demo of creating a kuberentes cluster and installing Jenkins X</a>:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"videoblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELA4tytdFeA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you really don&#8217;t want to use the public cloud, you can <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/install-on-cluster/\">install Jenkins X on an existing kubernetes cluster</a> (if it has RBAC enabled!). Or, if you can <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube\">install and run minikube</a>, then you should be able to <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/create-cluster/\">install Jenkins X on it as well</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"relationship-between-jenkins-and-jenkins-x\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#relationship-between-jenkins-and-jenkins-x\"></a>Relationship between Jenkins and Jenkins X</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins is the core CI/CD engine within Jenkins X. So Jenkins X is built on the massive shoulders of Jenkins and its awesome community.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We are <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/400\">proposing Jenkins X as a sub project</a> within the Jenkins foundation as Jenkins X has a different focus: automating CI/CD for the cloud using Jenkins plus other open source tools like Kubernetes, Helm, Git, Nexus/Artifactory etc.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Over time we are hoping Jenkins X can help drive some changes in Jenkins itself to become more cloud native, which will benefit the wider Jenkins community in addition to Jenkins X.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"please-join-us\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#please-join-us\"></a>Please join us!</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So I hope the above has given you a feel for the vision of where we are heading with Jenkins X and to show where we are today. The project is still very young, we have <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues\">lots to do</a> and we are looking for more input on where to go next and what to focus on. We&#8217;re also working on high level <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/contribute/roadmap\">roadmap</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To make Jenkins X a success we&#8217;d love you to get involved, <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/\">try it out</a> and <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/community/\">give us feedback in the community</a>!

For example Jenkins X creates <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases\">all the releases and release notes</a>. We&#8217;ll talk more about <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-x/updatebot\">UpdateBot</a> in a future blog post but you can see all the <a href=\"https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+archived%3Afalse+user%3Ajenkins-x+label%3Aupdatebot+is%3Aclosed\">automated pull requests generated</a> in the various Jenkins X pipelines via <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-x/updatebot\">UpdateBot</a> pushing version changes from upstream dependencies into downstream repositories.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Note that the Jenkins community tends to use IRC for chat and the Kubernetes community uses Slack, so Jenkins X has rooms for <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/community/\">both IRC and slack</a> depending on which chat technology you prefer - as the Jenkins X community will be working closely with both the Jenkins community and the various Kubernetes communities (Kubernetes, Helm, Skaffold, Istio et al).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>One of the most rewarding things about open source is being able to learn from others in the community. So I&#8217;m hoping that even if you are not yet ready to use Kubernetes in your day job or are not yet interested in automating your Continuous Delivery - that you&#8217;ll at least consider taking a look at Jenkins X, if for no other reason than to help you learn more about all these new ideas, technologies and approaches!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Thanks for listening and I&#8217;m looking forward to <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/community/\">seeing you in the community</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"links\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#links\"></a>Links</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/400\">Jenkins X JEP proposal</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/\">Jenkins X website</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/\">Getting Started Guide</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/demos/\">Demos</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"13be0610-c1c9-59de-ab77-d3fdaf0d1add","title":"Introducing Jenkins X: a CI/CD solution for modern cloud applications on Kubernetes","date":"2018-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2018/03/19/introducing-jenkins-x/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"jstrachan","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>James is a long time open source contributor, created the Groovy programming language and Apache Camel integration framework.\nFor the past few years he&#8217;s been working on CI/CD with Kubernetes.</p>\n</div>","id":"jstrachan","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"James Strachan","slug":"blog/author/jstrachan","twitter":"jstrachan"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2018/03/19/password-audit/","previous":"/blog/2018/03/15/jep-200-lts/","id":"13be0610-c1c9-59de-ab77-d3fdaf0d1add"}},
