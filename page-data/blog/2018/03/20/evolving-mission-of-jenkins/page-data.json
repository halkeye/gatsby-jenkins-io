Each is\nexciting in its own right, and I encourage interested parties to take a look at\ntheir goals and missions and participate in them.  But in this post, I want to\ndiscuss why together these two dots form an important arc, which actually\nstarted in the introduction of Jenkins 2 and continued with Blue Ocean.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In Jenkins 2, we changed Jenkins so that it starts with richer functionality\nand more sensible security setup, among other things.  This was the first step\nin a new direction for Jenkins.  We changed our focus from “we’ll write plugins\nand you figure out the rest” to “we’ll write plugins, we’ll assemble them, and\nwe’ll help you be more productive.”</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Blue Ocean was another step on this journey.  We focused on important\ncontinuous delivery use cases in Jenkins, and aimed to provide a great\nuser-experience for those use cases.  Aside from obvious productivity boost for\nusers, it also decidedly blended together feature areas that are internally\nprovided by a whole bunch of different plugins, but users see much less seam\nbetween them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Essentials, which <a href=\"https://github.com/rtyler\">R Tyler Croy</a> proposed in\nrecent weeks, is another step forward.  That project aims to take an even\nbigger responsibility in keeping people’s Jenkins instances up and running.\nLike Blue Ocean, Jenkins Essentials focuses on delivering a comprehensive\nJenkins user experience rather than a collection of unrelated plugins which\nusers have to figure out how to wire together.  It also creates an exciting\nvehicle for contributors, in which we can develop and deliver features quite\ndifferently, and more rapidly, than how we deliver them today.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins X, which was proposed by <a href=\"https://github.com/jstrachan\">James Strachan</a> a\nfew weeks after Jenkins Essentials, is the latest point on this same arc.\nJenkins X brings a different aspect to building a solution — it focuses on a\nspecific vertical area, namely Kubernetes application development, and\ndrastically simplifies the software development in that domain by bringing\ntogether Jenkins, a whole bunch of plugins, and an opinionated best practice of\nhow one should use Kubernetes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Collectively, the arc that these efforts form aims to solve the most important\nand consistent concerns for Jenkins users — ease of use, plugin complexity,\nfear of upgrade, etc.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the early days of Jenkins, it was up to each and every Jenkins admin to find\nthe right way to assemble pieces into a solution for their organizations, but\nthis hard work remained largely private.  Now, these newer projects are\nbringing this back into the community.  They are making Jenkins more valuable\nto existing users, and more approachable and useful to a whole new set of users\nwho are not currently using Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>From that perspective, I hope more projects like them will follow, pushing us\nbeyond “just writing plugins”, taking even bigger steps to make users\nproductive.  This is a little bit like how I watched Eclipse evolve from just a\nJava IDE to an umbrella of projects.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Exciting times!</p>\n</div>","id":"62b57ba0-b3a6-537c-a4d3-5430fc151996","title":"Evolving Mission of Jenkins","date":"2018-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2018/03/20/evolving-mission-of-jenkins/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/kohsuke.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke/","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"62b57ba0-b3a6-537c-a4d3-5430fc151996"}},
