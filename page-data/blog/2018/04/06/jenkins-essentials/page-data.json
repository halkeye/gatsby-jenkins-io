This will of course not replace the existing distribution of Jenkins core and\nits plugins, which allow many of us large amounts of flexibility, but rather it\nwill make Jenkins easier for users who don&#8217;t want to \"build it themselves.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The more I thought about it, the more excited about the idea I became: Jenkins\nEssentials could open the door to new improvements and features in Jenkins\nwhich had been left in the \"idea and design\" phase going back almost <em>two\nyears</em>! Really, I checked, some of the concepts adopted into the design of\nJenkins Essentials were first conceived of in early 2016!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke briefly discussed the project in\n<a href=\"/blog/2018/03/20/evolving-mission-of-jenkins/\">his previous blog post</a>\nbut in post I wanted to expand on <a href=\"#what\">what</a> Jenkins Essentials is, and our\n<a href=\"#progress\">progress</a> has been in its development.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"what\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what\"></a>What&#8217;s in Jenkins Essentials</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A few months ago I prepared\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/300/jenkins-essentials-and-evergreen-fosdem-2018.pdf\">this presentation</a>\nfor the\n<a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2018/\">FOSDEM 2018</a>\nJenkins Contributor Summit, which outlines the following \"pillars\" or Jenkins\nEssentials, which are also described in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/300\">JEP-300</a>:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#auto-update\">Automatically Updated Distribution</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#sane-defaults\">Automatic Sane Defaults</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#connected\">Connected</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#obvious-path\">Obvious Path to User Success</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"auto-update\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#auto-update\"></a>Automatically Updated Distribution</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In order to provide an easier-to-use and easier-to-manage Jenkins environment,\nJenkins Essentials will be distributed as an automatically self-updating\ndistribution, containing Jenkins core and a version-locked set of plugins\nconsidered \"essential.\" Rather than attempting to mirror the existing Weekly\nand LTS release lines for core, plus some plugin version matrix, Jenkins\nEssentials will update in a manner similar to Google Chrome.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This automatically updating distribution will mean that Jenkins Essentials will\nrequire significantly less overhead to manage, receiving improvements and bug\nfixes without any user involvement. From the user perspective, their Jenkins\nwill appear to automatically improve over time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonitionblock note\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"icon\">\n<i class=\"fa icon-note\" title=\"Note\"></i>\n</td>\n<td class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There is really interesting work being pioneered by\n<a href=\"https://github.com/batmat\">Baptiste Mathus</a>\nwith\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/302\">JEP-302</a>\nto ensure that these automatic upgrades can be performed safely.</p>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"sane-defaults\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#sane-defaults\"></a>Automatic Sane Defaults</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Providing a core along with \"essential\" plugins is a good first step to helping\nJenkins users successfully automate their CI/CD workloads, but requires\nadditional \"smoothing\" over some of the numerous options and configurations\nplugins. Jenkins Essentials will perform some amount of \"automatic\nenvironment-based self-configuration.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For example, clicking a \"Launch Stack\" button from the <a href=\"/download\">Download</a>\npage would launch an AWS-flavored Jenkins Essentials which, out of the box\nattempts to set up AWS-specific configuration with S3 and EC2 services.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"connected\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#connected\"></a>Connected</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In order to provide a more seamless experience for end-users, and ensure that\nJenkins project developers receive useful error and usage telemetry to drive\nfurther improvements in Jenkins, Jenkins Essentials must necessarily be viewed\nas a \"<strong>Connected</strong>\" application. This means some yet-to-be-specified number of\nserver-side applications to coordinate updates, receive and process telemetry,\nbroker 3rd-party service authentications, relay webhooks, etc.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"obvious-path\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#obvious-path\"></a>Obvious Path to User Success</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The final pillar in Jenkins Essentials, is to ensure that Jenkins provides an\nobvious path for a user to configure and use it successfully. This largely\nentails in-application documentation, examples, and disabling legacy\nfunctionality within the application. All with the end goal of preventing users\nfrom inadvertently choosing legacy, or poorly supported, options when\nconfiguring their CI/CD workloads.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"progress\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#progress\"></a>Progress thus far</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Suffice it to say, Jenkins Essentials is a hugely ambitious project!

We have been adamantly following the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep\">Jenkins Enhancement Proposal</a>\nprocess, and have been making sure our designs and implementations are clear as\nwe build them.
