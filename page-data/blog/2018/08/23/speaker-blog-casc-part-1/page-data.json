Just deploy a Docker container.\nInfrastructure is missing resources? Apply a Terraform recipe to allocate more on your favourite Cloud.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>What about the Jenkins administrator role in this context? Should they still spend hours in the web UI, clicking checkboxes on web forms? Maybe they already adopted some automation, relying on Groovy script voodoo, or some home-made XML templating?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Early this year we announced the first alpha release of “Jenkins Configuration-as-Code” (JCasC), a fresh new approach to Jenkins configuration management, based on YAML configuration files and automatic model discovery.\n“JCasC” has been promoted as a\n<a href=\"https://jenkins.io/projects/\">top-level</a> Jenkins project, and the corresponding\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/201/\">Jenkins Enhancement Proposal</a> has been accepted.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"what-can-jcasc-do-for-our-jenkins-administrator\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-can-jcasc-do-for-our-jenkins-administrator\"></a>What can JCasC do for our Jenkins Administrator?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>JCasC allows us to apply a set of YAML files on our Jenkins controller at startup or on-demand via the web UI.\nThose configuration files are very concise and human readable compared to verbose XML files the Jenkins uses to actually store configuration.\nThe files also have user-friendly naming conventions making it easy for administrators to configure all Jenkins components.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Here’s an example:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight nowrap\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\">jenkins:\n systemMessage: \"Jenkins managed by Configuration as Code\"\n\n securityRealm:\n   ldap:\n     configurations:\n       - server: ldap.acme.com\n         rootDN: dc=acme,dc=fr\n         managerPasswordSecret: ${LDAP_PASSWORD}\n     cache:\n       size: 100\n       ttl: 10\n     userIdStrategy: CaseInsensitive\n     groupIdStrategy: CaseSensitive</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As you can see, you don’t need long explanation to understand how this YAML file will setup your Jenkins controller.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"benefits\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#benefits\"></a>Benefits</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The most immediate benefit of JCasC is reproducibility.\nAn administrator can now bootstrap a new Jenkins controller with the exact same configuration with a trivial setup.\nThis allows them to create a test instance and check the impact of plugin upgrades in a sandboxed environment.\nThis also lets them be more confident with failover and disaster recovery scenarios.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Further benefits come when administrators start managing their Jenkins’ YAML configuration files in source control, like they do with Terraform configuration.\nDoing so gives them auditing and reversibility of their Jenkins controller configuration.\nTheycan establish a sane configuration change workflow that runs a test Jenkins instance and ensures configuration is healthy before actually applying any change to their production Jenkins controller.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Last but not least, with ability to quickly setup Jenkins controllers and control them from a set of shared YAML configuration files, administrators can now offer per-team Jenkins instances, with more flexibility on installed plugins.\nA controller becomes more or less a transient piece of infrastructure for your team, as long as they also manage build definition with Jenkinsfiles.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>With Configuration-as-Code we can stop having to treat our Jenkins controller like a pet we need to pamper, and start managing Jenkins controllers as cattle you can replace without effort nor impacts.\nWelcome in the “as-code” world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/2018-casc/image4.jpg\" alt=\"Cattle not pets\" width=\"800\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"title\">Figure 1.
