2GB memory:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With Jenkins on Fargate: 100 builds * 5 mins = $0.633/month</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With Jenkins on EC2 Instances: ~50/month</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This huge potential cost saving is one of the things that makes serverless incredibly compelling.\nNot to mention you don&#8217;t have to think much upfront about scaling the system.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>But there are drawbacks with this approach, noted as:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cold starts - slower boot times for clients</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Large container images (~1G)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No root access</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ephemeral storage (default)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is an area where Jenkins can continue to evolve to make the most of serverless architectures.\nI highly recommend you check out the\n<a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/anubhavmishra/building-a-serverless-continuous-integration-and-delivery-pipeline\">slides</a> for yourself.\nThe best part is that, in the true spirit of open source, Anubvha shared the code\n<a href=\"https://github.com/anubhavmishra/hello-oscon\">here</a>.\nSo you can give it a try yourself and build your own serverless CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"e7cd7824-744d-512b-9ee1-51257e0c567a","title":"Building a Serverless CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins","date":"2018-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2018/08/06/serverless-cicd-jenkins/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/f84eb/tracymiranda.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/6105b/tracymiranda.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/9d80c/tracymiranda.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/f84eb/tracymiranda.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/a5e1e/tracymiranda.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/a4758/tracymiranda.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/fec68/tracymiranda.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/fe590/tracymiranda.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/c2c8e/tracymiranda.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":116}}},"blog":"https://tracymiranda.com/","github":"tracymiranda","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Tracy is the Director of Open Source Community at CloudBees, long time open source contributor and evangelist.</p>\n</div>","id":"tracymiranda","irc":"tracymiranda","linkedin":null,"name":"Tracy Miranda","slug":"/blog/author/tracymiranda","twitter":"tracymiranda"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2018/08/14/simple-pull-request-plugin-final-evaluation/","previous":"/blog/2018/07/30/introducing-cloud-native-sig/","id":"e7cd7824-744d-512b-9ee1-51257e0c567a"}},
