(possibly hidden) options, Jenkins can be used for a wide range of use cases.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The downside of all this flexibility is that, not knowing how people use Jenkins, we mostly rely on issues filed in our bug tracker to know when things go wrong.\nAnd over the years, quite a few things have gone wrong.\nThe worst of these have been security fixes that have had unintended side effects.\nUnlike regular changes, it&#8217;s not really feasible to roll back security fixes, so users have sometimes had to choose between security and functionality.\nBut even changes developed in the open, such as the introduction of <a href=\"/blog/2018/01/13/jep-200/\">JEP-200</a>, haven&#8217;t gone as smoothly as we hoped.\n<a href=\"/blog/2018/08/31/shifting-gears/\">With big changes in the works</a>, it&#8217;s more important than ever for us to have a better idea how Jenkins is used, so that we can deliver major changes safely.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"/projects/evergreen/\">Jenkins Evergreen</a> solves this to some degree by being always connected to the Jenkins project and reporting back telemetry (mostly errors) allowing us to quickly react and provide fixes.\nBut that project is still pretty new, and its goal of being a more standardized Jenkins does not represent the breadth of configurations of the general user base.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"uplink-telemetry\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#uplink-telemetry\"></a>Uplink telemetry</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So we recently extended the existing, very limited anonymous usage statistics by adding a simple, extensible telemetry reporting client.\nWe&#8217;re calling it <em>Uplink telemetry</em>, based on the name of <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/uplink/\">the service it reports its data to</a>.\nIt made its debut in Jenkins 2.143.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Uplink telemetry is designed to collect data in <em>trials</em>, which are defined as:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a well defined set of technical data with a specific purpose</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a start and end date of the collection</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Detailed information explaining the scope and purpose of currently active trials is available in the inline help for the usage statistics control in the global configuration.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/2018-10-09/telemetry.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of detailed Uplink telemetry trial description in the Jenkins inline help\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Of course, opting out of anonymous usage statistics there also disables the submission of Uplink telemetry.\nAnd while Uplink trials report a per-instance UUID to help with collation (e.g. removal of duplicate submissions), that UUID is exclusively used for this purpose, and independent of all other properties of an instance.\nThis prevents us from correlating reported data with specific instances.\nThese measures are in place to strike a balance between the need to understand how Jenkins is used and respecting users' privacy.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"improving-jenkins-through-real-world-data\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#improving-jenkins-through-real-world-data\"></a>Improving Jenkins through real-world data</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We&#8217;re already created our first trial.\nJenkins 2.143 includes a trial to gather information about how common it is for instances to use Java system properties to disable (parts of) security fixes.\nWhen we publish a security fix and we&#8217;re not completely certain it is safe to apply for everyone, we add another of these options&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;just in case.\nAs you can imagine, quite a few of these hidden options exist.\nUntil now, user feedback in our issue tracker was the only way we could estimate the need for any of these options.\nWith Uplink, Jenkins will report that information to us.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The trial is scheduled to run for the next six weeks, enough to hopefully gather this information from a large number of users of both LTS and weekly releases.\nOur hope is that we will be able to remove some of these options entirely, as they might not be needed after all.\nFor others, we might need to consider elevating them to supported features, or finding better solutions obviating the need for them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the future, I will publish of some of what we have learned from the first trial running through Uplink telemetry.\nI look forward to Jenkins continuing to improve with real-world data informing our future decisions.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"5b555e56-ade0-57d9-9cb9-c98ec50c81bf","title":"Improving Jenkins Release Quality using Uplink
