2018 has officially finished on August 23, and we had a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/events/253577758/\">Jenkins Online Meetup</a> where we had final presentations of the GSoC projects.\nIt is never late to provide more context, so I would like to summarize the results and provide updates of what was happening in <a href=\"/sigs/gsoc\">Jenkins GSoC Special Interest Group</a> over last 2 months.\nIn this blogpost you can find project status overviews and updates from the Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs/gsoc\">GSoC SIG</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>But first of all, I would like to thank all our students, their mentors\nand to all other contributors who proposed project ideas, participated in student selection, community bonding and further reviews.\nGoogle Summer of Code is a major effort which would not be possible without active participation of the Jenkins community</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"summary\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#summary\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This year we started preparing for Google Summer of Code in early December.\n14 project ideas and 12 potential mentors we published on our website,\nand we got dozens of students reaching out to us during the application period.\nAfter processing applications, we have selected 4 applications for GSoC.\nUnfortunately one project got cancelled due to student eligibility issues.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So, we had the following projects:\nCode Coverage API plugin, Remoting over Apache Kafka, and Simple Pull-Request Job Plugin\n(also known as <em>Pipeline as YAML</em>).\nAll these projects have a significant value to the Jenkins community.\nThey were focused on areas which have been discussed in the community for a long time,\nbut which had no progress so far.\nGoogle Summer of Code allowed us to kick-start these projects,\nand to make significant progress there.\nAll projects have been released and made available in the Jenkins community (common or experimental update centers).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In total there were 9 blogposts about GSoC projects on jenkins.io,\nand also 2 <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup\">Jenkins Online Meetups</a>.\nGSoC results have been also presented at DevOps World - Jenkins World conference and the contributor summit.</p>\n</div>\n<center>\n  <iframe

Zheng</a>, Henan University, China</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mentors:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeffpearce\">Jeff Pearce</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/christ66\">Steven Christou</a>,\n<a

href=\"/projects/gsoc/2018/code-coverage-api-plugin/\">Project page</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There are many code coverage plugins in Jenkins: Cobertura, JaCoCo, Emma, etc., etc.\nThe problem with these plugins is that each of them implements all code coverage features on their own.\nSo you get different feature sets, UIs, CLI commands and REST APIs.\nThe idea of this project was to unify the existing functionality and offer a new API plugin which other plugins could extend.\nIt would help to simplify existing plugin and to create new plugins for coverage tools.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The project has started really well, and we had the first demo after a week of coding.\nThen Shenyu continued extending the plugin&#8217;s functionality over coding periods.\nHere is the list of the key features offered by the plugin:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Flexible data structure for defining and storing coverage metrics within Jenkins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Coverage charts and trends</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Source code navigation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>REST API for retrieving coverage stats and trends</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Report aggregation for parallel steps</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Extension points which allow integrating other plugins</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In addition to the Code Coverage API Plugin,\nShenyu added integration to the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/cobertura\">Cobertura Plugin</a> and also created a new <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/llvm-cov-plugin\">llvm-cov plugin</a> which is expected to be released soon.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After GSoC Shenyu continued contributing to the Jenkins project.\nHe works on the Code Coverage API plugin and also participates in the <a href=\"/sigs/chinese-localization/\">Chinese Localization SIG</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div

introducing a way to\neasily define pull-request build job definitions in YAML.\nThis project has been shaped a lot during the application period and community bonding,\nso that the project fit the existing Jenkins Ecosystem better.\nFinally it was decided to build the new plugin on the top of <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-multibranch\">Pipeline: Multi-Branch Plugin</a>.\nThere was also an idea to offer extra syntax sugar, templating and automatic resolution for common flows,\nso that users need less time to define Pipelines for common use-cases.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The plugin allows defining Pipeline jobs as YAML being stored in SCM.\nOriginal design presumed a new job type,\nbut during community bonding and Phase 1 prototyping it was decided to build the plugin on the top of the existing Pipeline ecosystem and extension points.\nCurrently the plugin generates Declarative Pipeline code from YAML so that it gets a lot of Pipeline features out-of-the box.\nIn addition to that, Simple Pull Request Job Plugin uses a an engine provided by the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin\">Configuration as Code plugin</a> to convert YAML snippets\nto Pipeline step definitions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The plugin has been well described by Abhishek in his <a href=\"/blog/2018/08/14/simple-pull-request-plugin-final-evaluation/\">Pipeline as YAML</a> blogpost in August.\nCurrently it is available in the <a href=\"/doc/developer/publishing/releasing-experimental-updates/\">Experimental Update Center</a> as an alpha version.\nPham Vu Tuan, one of our GSoC students, have also joined the plugin team.\nAt the DevOps World - Jenkins World hackfest we had discussions with the Jenkins Pipeline team,\nand we have a plan towards making this plugin available as an Incubated Pipeline project.\nThe final implementation may change,\nbut in any case the project gave us a working prototype and a lot of information about  obstacles we need to resolve.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"remoting-over-apache-kafka\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#remoting-over-apache-kafka\"></a>Remoting over Apache Kafka</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Student: <a href=\"https://github.com/pvtuan10\">Pham Vu Tuan</a>, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mentors:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/oleg-nenashev\">Oleg Nenashev</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Supun94\">Supun Wanniarachchi</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/projects/gsoc/2018/remoting-over-message-bus/\">Project page</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Last but not least, Remoting over Kafka is another challenging project we had.\nTo implement communication between its controllers and agents, Jenkins widely uses home-grown protocol implementations based on TCP\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/docs/protocols.md\">JNLP 1..4 protocols</a>).\nThere are some performance and stability implementations,\nand there have been discussions about using an industry-standard message bus or queue.\nPham Vu Tuan proposed to use Apache Kafka for it,\nand after some experiments during community bonding and first coding phase we agreed to go forward with this implementation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>During his project Vu Tuan extended Jenkins Core and Remoting to allow implementing an agent communication channel in a plugin.\nThen he has created a new <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/remoting-kafka\">Remoting over Kafka plugin</a>\nwhich is now available in the main Jenkins Update cente.\nOnce the plugin is installed, it is possible to connect to agents over Apache Kafka and execute all types of Jenkins jobs there.\nThere are also official <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/remoting-kafka-agent/\">jenkins/remoting-kafka-agent</a> images available on DockerHub.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Vu Tuan continued contributing to the Jenkins project after GSoC, currently he maintains the Remoting over Kafka plugin.\nHe visited the <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/san-francisco\">DevOps World - Jenkins World US</a> conference in September, presented his GSoC project at the\n<a href=\"/blog/2018/07/25/contributor-summit/\">Jenkins Contributor Summit</a>.\nYou can find his slides <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1drRIDNvDKdBE-VuuLFXlWRB0NhSFr1aWrg2p8qrF3co/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.\nAfter the conference he also participated in the hackfest where he helped to migrate Jenkins' DNS services to Microsoft Azure.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"what-could-we-do-better\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-could-we-do-better\"></a>What could we do better?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After the end of GSoC we had a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJ9KIYHUoFWWE9HmoZC7HPDxm2i3uMFGQ2KKZ_1TTjk/edit?usp=sharing\">Retrospective</a> with GSoC students and mentors.\nWe discussed the issues we encountered during the projects,\nand ways to improve the student and mentor experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Main takeaways for us:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GSoC projects should be aligned with <a href=\"/sigs\">Jenkins Special Interest Groups (SIGs)</a> or <a href=\"/projects\">subprojects</a> in order to get a wider list of stakeholders\nProjects should be aligned with SIG priorities when possible</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In addition to GSoC SIG meetings and Jenkins Online Meetups during student evaluation,\nwe should also run regular status updates within SIGs so that there more contributors involved in projects</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We should invest more time into forming mentor teams before the application period starts.\nThis year there were changes in mentor teams after the community bonding started, and it complicated the work</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We should pay more attention to student eligibility.\nThis year we started from 4 projects, but unfortunately one project (EDA plugins for Jenkins) got cancelled due to the visa limitations the student had.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We should do regular office hours for mentors/students so that it is possible to exchange information between GSoC projects within the organization.\nThis year we cancelled them at the end of phase and relied only on regular project meetings and mailing lists, but this is not enough.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For me personally the main takeaway is also to reduce direct involvement into the project as a mentor and technical advisor.\nDoing org administration, logistics and mentorship is not good from a bus factor PoV,\nand I believe I was pushing my vision too hard in few cases.\nWill do my best to prevent it next year.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you want to share your feedback and ideas,\nplease reach out to us using the <a

href=\"#whats-next\"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In order to improve GSoC organization in Jenkins,\nwe have have created a <a href=\"/sigs/gsoc\">GSoC Special Interest Group</a> which will be running non-stop as other SIGs in Jenkins.\nThe objective of the SIG is to organize GSoC, work with potential students/mentors,\nand to help students stay involved in the community after GSoC ends.\nIn this SIG we will have monthly meetings to sync-up on GSoC.\nIf you are interested to contribute, please join the SIG.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJ9KIYHUoFWWE9HmoZC7HPDxm2i3uMFGQ2KKZ_1TTjk/edit?usp=sharing\">Retrospective</a>, next year we plan to invest more\ninto communication with mentors.\nWe will also try to tie new project proposals to Jenkins\n<a href=\"/sigs\">Special Interest Groups</a> so that the students become a part\nof ongoing coordinated efforts.\nThis weekend Martin d&#8217;Anjou, Jeff Pearce and me are participating in the GSoC Mentor summit to share experiences and to study from other GSoC organizations.\nOn October 17 we will have a GSoC SIG meeting to discuss our experience and to discuss next steps.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In addition to that,\nJenkins Google Summer of Code will be presented at <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/nice\">DevOps World - Jenkins World Nice</a> and at the contributor summit.\nIf you plan to visit the conference and you are interested to participate in Google Summer of Code and other community activities,\nplease join us at the <a href=\"/blog/2018/08/21/contributor-summit-nice/\">contributor summit</a> or stop by at the community booth.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>And, elephant in the room&#8230;&#8203; GSoC 2019.\nOf course we are going to apply, stay tuned for new announcements.\nWe have already started collecting project ideas for the next year.\nIf you are interested to participate as a student or mentor,\nplease reach out to us using the <a
