The idea is to pool those test cases in the community so that we can test Jenkins and its plugins as we develop them. For this to work, we want tests to have lots of metadata (such as what plugins it touches), and for the harness to have sufficient modularity that different people can run the same scenario against different deployments, including existing instance. +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","id":"8fb1b33c-49ca-5f6f-aac3-ef146ba885e2","title":"Upcoming Jenkins Office Hours: Acceptance Test Harness","date":"2014-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2014/04/15/upcoming-jenkins-office-hours-acceptance-test-harness/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2014/04/16/active-directory-plugin-improvements/","previous":"/blog/2014/04/11/jenkins-1-532-3-lts-is-released/","id":"8fb1b33c-49ca-5f6f-aac3-ef146ba885e2"}},
