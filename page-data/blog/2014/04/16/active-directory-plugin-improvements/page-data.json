In the past few months, I've been making steady improvements in this plugin, thanks to various inputs and bug reports given to me from the ClodBees customers. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nOne of the recent fixes was to get https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-9258[the \"remember me\" feature] finally working for Active Directory. This requires a relatively new Jenkins 1.556, but it eliminates the need to having to constantly type the password in. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nThen I've rebumped the version of https://github.com/kohsuke/com4j[COM4J], which was https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-16429[causing a thread leak] when Jenkins runs on Windows. If you are running a Windows deployment with lots of active users, this probably would have contributed to the instability of Jenkins. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAnd then lastly, a small but crucial improvement was made to the way we search group membership, so that we can avoid recursively searching AD. This should result in a significant speed improvement when you are logging into Jenkins through AD. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nThe latest version of the plugin as of writing is 1.37. I hope you'll have a chance to update the plugin soon. +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"0ec96a9f-b23f-50d8-805d-75b5682f95aa","title":"Active Directory plugin improvements","date":"2014-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2014/04/16/active-directory-plugin-improvements/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2014/04/18/come-join-the-infra-team/","previous":"/blog/2014/04/15/upcoming-jenkins-office-hours-acceptance-test-harness/","id":"0ec96a9f-b23f-50d8-805d-75b5682f95aa"}},
