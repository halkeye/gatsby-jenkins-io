We are the butlers of the butler that get Mr.Jenkins going. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nWe've been https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra[managing our servers through puppet], and have been slowly folding pieces one at a time to puppet, but there's still a lot of snowflake services that need proper operationalization. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nSo to fix them up, https://puppetlabs.com/[PuppetLabs] folks generously agreed to help us get going with a deployment of Puppet Enterprise. Tyler has managed to arrange a \"rapid deployment\" engagement. To kick start the effort, an instructor would come for one week (April 28th-May 2nd) to bring us up to speed on modern Puppet. we'll then spend some time on our own to puppt-ize more, and deploy Puppet Enterprise. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nThe end goal is to ensure sustainability of our infrastructure, in case of unexpected server loss. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAs we are about to get this effort going, we think this is a good time to solicit a few more volunteers. We are looking for someone who could join this two week engagement in San Francisco, and keep their involvement beyond that. This is a part time volunteer work, and you'd get some visibility and exposure to the inner guts of open-source projects, not to mention the satisfaction of getting thanked for your work. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nIf you are interested, please https://jenkins-ci.org/content/mailing-lists[drop us a note at the infra list]. +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"5bbecced-75bb-5402-bb56-862bcae6a516","title":"Come join the infra team!","date":"2014-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2014/04/18/come-join-the-infra-team/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2014/04/24/juc-agenda-posted/","previous":"/blog/2014/04/16/active-directory-plugin-improvements/","id":"5bbecced-75bb-5402-bb56-862bcae6a516"}},
