Many of you might know me on IRC as schristou, my github id as https://github.com/christ66[christ66], or my twitter handle https://twitter.com/schristou88[@schristou88]. In Jenkins, I am currently working on some significant improvements to the subversion-plugin, along with various random bug fixes. I am also the current maintainer of https://cobertura.github.io/cobertura[Cobertura], an open source code coverage tool for java. Prior to working on Jenkins, I was working on Hudson at the Eclipse Foundation. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nWhile working on Jenkins, I usually get requests (usually in IRC) about where to start when writing a plugin. Some examples are \"Where do I start?\" or \"Do you have any examples?\". Well at https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston[JUC Boston], I will be hosting a small lecture called Get Drunk on the Code! I will be giving the lecture in the rooms \"Back Bay\" (1 &amp; 2) where people will be able to sit down, drink a beer, and learn how to write a Jenkins plugin! I will be teaching people everything from how to get started, to some advanced techniques like writing a new https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI[CLI Command], and writing your own builder. I forgot to mention that I will be handing out beer while this is happening! +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nThis session will be happening after the exhibit break from 3:30pm to 6:00pm. It will be two hours where I will be walking around, and helping users if they encounter any issues while the session is happening. So grab your laptop, a beer and get drunk on the code! Don't get too drunk, but if you do at least you can improve the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Beer+Plugin[beer plugin]!\"</pre>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"2f54b3ab-a59b-564b-bc8e-ab28b9493091","title":"Get drunk on the code in JUC-Boston","date":"2014-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2014/06/05/get-drunk-on-the-code-in-juc-boston/","authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"christ66","html":"","id":"christ66","irc":"schristou","linkedin":null,"name":"Steven Christou","slug":"/blog/authors/christ66/","twitter":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2f54b3ab-a59b-564b-bc8e-ab28b9493091"}},
