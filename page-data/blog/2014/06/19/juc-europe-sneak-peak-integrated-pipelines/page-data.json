We are all very passionate about automation, infrastructure-as-code, configuration management and of course… Jenkins. +\n +\nMy team and I specialize in implementing continuous delivery for large scale transformation deliveries. We work with a wide range of technologies from open source, packaged products, through to software-as-a-service. We work with physical infrastructure, private cloud, public cloud and platforms-as-a-service, but there is one almost uniquely common factor… using Jenkins. +\n +\nAt the conference I will be expecting to exchange views with others using Jenkins at similar scale and am particularly interested in https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#JosefFuchshuber[sessions] covering using Jenkins with Docker and making Jenkins https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#HarpreetSingh[more resilient]. +\n +\nI am also looking forward to presenting https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#MarkRendell[this lightening talk] where I will be demoing ways in which we’ve extended Jenkins to implement complex integrated pipelines for large-scale software implementations. https://markosrendell.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/reducing-continuous-delivery-impedance-part-2-solution-complexity/[See here] for a sneak preview.</pre>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"5e53c482-fa8b-54ea-9fb4-d2dfc6f096d5","title":"JUC Europe Sneak Peak: Integrated Pipelines","date":"2014-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2014/06/19/juc-europe-sneak-peak-integrated-pipelines/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2014/06/20/juc-boston-what-a-day/","previous":"/blog/2014/06/16/get-together-at-beer-garden-for-juc-berlin/","id":"5e53c482-fa8b-54ea-9fb4-d2dfc6f096d5"}},
