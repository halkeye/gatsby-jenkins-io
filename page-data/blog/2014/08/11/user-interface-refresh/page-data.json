This has been a real community effort, with collaboration from lots of people, both in terms of implementation and in terms of providing honest/critical feedback. Lots of people deserve credit but, in particular, a big thanks to https://github.com/kevinburke[Kevin Burke] and https://github.com/daniel-beck[Daniel Beck]. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nYou're probably familiar with how the Jenkins UI currently looks, but for the sake of comparison I think it's worth showing a screenshot of the current/old UI alongside a screnshot of the new UI. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nhttps://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/current.png[ +\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/current.preview.png[image,width=500] +\n] +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\n*_Current / Old Look &amp; Feel_* +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nhttps://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/new.png[ +\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/new.preview.png[image,width=500] +\n] +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\n*_New Look &amp; Feel_* +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">+\n+</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAmong other things, you'll see: +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A new responsive layout based on &lt;div&gt; elements (as opposed to &lt;table&gt; elements).

That said, I think we'll need to bite the bullet and tackle this sooner or later because it's a big usability issue. +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","id":"2235bd0e-d668-56ae-9fb4-d4d03b916fac","title":"User Interface Refresh","date":"2014-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2014/08/11/user-interface-refresh/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2014/08/12/jenkins-user-meet-up-in-london/","previous":"/blog/2014/07/30/geek-choice-awards-2014/","id":"2235bd0e-d668-56ae-9fb4-d4d03b916fac"}},
