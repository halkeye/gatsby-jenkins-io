I&#8217;m going to focus on the challenge of identifying and choosing solutions for the many \"adjacent problem spaces\" to Continuous Integration that you run into when trying to move to Continuous Delivery: artifact management, feature tracking, environment provisioning, deployment automation, test management, pipeline orchestration, production feedback and more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">+\n+</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We&#8217;ll discuss some of the options available for each category, with a special focus on app deployment, test result management and pipeline orchestration. We&#8217;ll also present a couple of real-world Continuous Delivery Machine architectures, and analyze some of the motivations for each organization&#8217;s choices.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">+\n+</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Most of our users use XebiaLabs tools/products in combination with Jenkins to build out their Continuous Delivery stack. If youâ€™re scaling out your Jenkins usage too, stop by the XebiaLabs booth to see if you can pick up some tips and to say hello.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">+\n+</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Look forward to seeing you <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-03-1400\">at the event</a>, or check the slides or recording we will post after the event.
