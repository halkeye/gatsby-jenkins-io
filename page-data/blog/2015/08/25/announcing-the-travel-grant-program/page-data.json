Our goal is to enable more members of the community to meet each other and exchange ideas in person.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We&#8217;re still hashing out the details, but it&#8217;ll be available to every Jenkins community member. Apply, telling us what Jenkins-related event you&#8217;d like to attend and how awesome you are, and we may support your travel with up to 500 USD. For details on how this will work, see the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Travel+Grant+Program\">current draft of the travel grant program</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The first person to be supported in this way is Pradeepto Bhattacharya from Pune, India. He was <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/europe/01-01-1400-bhattacharya\">a speaker at this year&#8217;s JUC Europe</a> in London, and will give <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-02-1400\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-02-1130\">talks</a> at <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west\">JUC US West</a> next week&#8212;&#8203;and we help him get there! He asked us a few weeks back whether the Jenkins project could support his trip to the US. We came to the conclusion that this would be a good idea&#8212;&#8203;so good in fact, that we decided to build a regular program from it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Are you planning to attend a JUC or similar event, but worry about the cost of travel?
