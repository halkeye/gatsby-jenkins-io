Fortunately, we had the binary logs from the 17th through the 30th. This means that though most data could be restored, some data from between the 15th and the 17th was lost.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For our issue tracker, that means that issues JENKINS-29432 to JENKINS-29468 were lost, as well as comments posted from about July 15 12:20 PM to July 17 2 AM (UTC).
