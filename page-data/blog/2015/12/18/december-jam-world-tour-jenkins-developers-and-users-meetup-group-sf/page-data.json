We had 96 RSVPs which was\nimpressive. Our speaker for the evening was <strong>Akshay Dayal</strong>, Software Engineer at\nGoogle. Akshay&#8217;s session was about Scaling Jenkins - how and why Google decided\nto scale their existing Jenkins cluster (OSS) to meet their\nsecurity/availability and failover requirements and how heavy automation played\nan important role in this effort.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The second talk was about how Google worked with Jenkins to read config data\nexternally.
