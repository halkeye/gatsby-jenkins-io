Plugin authors move on when they change jobs, or lose interest in the plugin, and that&#8217;s fine. Plugins are hosted on the Jenkins project infrastructure after all, and when a maintainer moves on, others can continue their work.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The major problem of course is that it&#8217;s often difficult to tell whether a plugin is still maintained (and there&#8217;s just not a lot going on), or whether its maintainer has lost interest. Most plugins don&#8217;t get released every few weeks, or even every few months, and still do their job just fine.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To connect plugins that aren&#8217;t actively maintained with potential maintainers, we recently implemented the \"Adopt-a-plugin\" initiative: We built a list of plugins that are up for \"adoption\", and display a prominent message on the plugins' wiki pages. Anyone interested in taking over as a plugin maintainer can then contact us, and we&#8217;ll set you up.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Are you interested in becoming a plugin maintainer? Maybe one of your favorite plugins isn&#8217;t actively maintained right now.
