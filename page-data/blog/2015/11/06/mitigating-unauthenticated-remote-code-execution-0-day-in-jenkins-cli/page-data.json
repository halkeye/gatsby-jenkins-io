Unfortunately the vulnerability was not disclosed to us ahead of its publication so we&#8217;re still working on more thorough fix. In the <em>meantime</em> however, we wanted to inform you of the issue and provide a workaround which will help prevent this exploit from being used against public Jenkins installations, for future reference this issue is being tracked privately as <code>SECURITY-218</code> in our <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io\">issue tracker</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The attack is mounted through the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI\">Jenkins CLI</a> subsystem, so the work-around is to remove/disable the CLI support inside of the running Jenkins server.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Using the following Groovy script you can disable the attack vector in your Jenkins installations by navigating to &#8220;Manage Jenkins&#8221; and then to &#8220;Script Console&#8221;, or just go to <code>https://your-jenkins-installation/script</code>. This only addresses the current running Jenkins process, in order to make the workaround persist between restarts of the Jenkins server, add the script below to <code>$JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy</code> (create the directory if necessary, and the file).</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\">import jenkins.*;\nimport jenkins.model.*;\nimport hudson.model.*;\n\n// disabled CLI access over TCP listener (separate port)\ndef p = AgentProtocol.all()\np.each { x -&gt;\n  if (x.name.contains(\"CLI\")) p.remove(x)\n}\n\n// disable CLI access over /cli URL\ndef removal = { lst -&gt;\n  lst.each { x -&gt; if (x.getClass().name.contains(\"CLIAction\")) lst.remove(x) }\n}\ndef j = Jenkins.instance;\nremoval(j.getExtensionList(RootAction.class))\nremoval(j.actions)</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>in order to make the workaround persist between restarts of the Jenkins server, add the script below to <code>$JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy</code> (create the directory if necessary, and the file).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The latest version of this script can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/SECURITY-218\">in this GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As previously announced on the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories\">jenkinsci-advisories</a> mailing list we&#8217;re preparing a security release for this upcoming Wednesday which will include patches for both the latest and LTS lines of Jenkins core.
