The goal is to make Confluence upgrade more manageable and testable. In the proces, I've not only containerized Confluence, but also containerized https://github.com/jenkins-infra/confluence-cache[some other services], including https://github.com/jenkins-infra/mock-ldap[mock LDAP server], to be able to test the copy of the production Confluence dataset against newer versions of Confluence before upgrading production. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nThe infra team is currently http://lists.jenkins-ci.org/pipermail/jenkins-infra/2015-April/000292.html[targeting this weekend] to migrate our current Confluence instance to this new container, and use the opportunity to move the service to a bigger system. Currently JIRA and Confluence has to live within 2.5GB RAM from the same host, and it's really stretching both services. The new box has 4GB of RAM, and we are splitting JIRA and Confluence to two different servers. So there's a lot of head room. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nSo please expect some Wiki outage over the next weekend. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAs always, our sincere thank you to https://osuosl.org/[Oregon State University Open Source Lab] for generously hosting our servers.
