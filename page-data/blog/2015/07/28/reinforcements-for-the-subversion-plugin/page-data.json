Many users were therefore forced to keep using an older release of the plugin to keep their instances running.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To fix this difficult situation I&#8217;ve decided to dedicate my spare time to improving the plug-in and attempting to restore the stability that an essential plug-in like this requires.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In order to do so, <a href=\"https://github.com/recena/\">me</a>, my colleague <a href=\"https://github.com/christ66\">Steven Christou</a> and other members of the community have drawn up a plan.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the coming weeks we will be focusing our efforts on:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Going through the Jira tickets</p>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Checking whether they are duplicated</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Checking whether they are still relevant</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Asking for more information from the people who reported them</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Establishing their priority</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewing pull requests</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Investigating bug reports and try to reproduce them</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixing serious bugs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refactoring the plugin to improve its maintainability.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We&#8217;re planning to publish a new 2.5.x bugfix release once a fortnight. We are not considering the inclusion of new features or improvements. The priority now must be to obtain a stable and reliable plug-in, one that will allow us to take things up again in the future with greater security and peace of mind.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><em>Interested in helping?
