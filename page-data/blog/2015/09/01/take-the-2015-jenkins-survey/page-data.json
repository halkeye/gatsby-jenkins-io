Obviously, the developers in the project deal with individual bug reports and feature requests all the time, but sometimes those day-to-day issues distract you from a bigger picture.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend over time. But we also wanted to bring in some questions around how you are using Jenkins and what other technologies you leverage such as Linux containers and cloud services.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The survey will close at the end of September and, if you participate, you&#8217;ll get to see the results first. CloudBees is sponsoring the survey and as an added incentive for us to fill it out, CloudBees has pitched in a $100 Amazon gift card (thanks CloudBees!). Information you submit is only going to be used by the community and not by CloudBees. So please take the survey and let your voice be heard.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.cloudbees.com/2015/09/jenkins-community-survey-your-chance-to.html\">Finally, there are laws that govern prize giveaways like this and CloudBees has put up terms and conditions for this.</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"take-the-survey-here\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#take-the-survey-here\"></a><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Jenkins2015\">Take the survey here</a></h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n\n</div>\n</div>","id":"f4f82a03-90a1-51e1-90ce-480982463d6d","title":"Take the 2015 Jenkins Survey!","date":"2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2015/09/01/take-the-2015-jenkins-survey/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2015/09/03/jenkins-user-conference-west-day-1/","previous":"/blog/2015/08/31/plugin-spotlight-version-column-plugin/","id":"f4f82a03-90a1-51e1-90ce-480982463d6d"}},
