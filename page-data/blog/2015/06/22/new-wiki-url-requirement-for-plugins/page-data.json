How do you learn more about them, preferably without installing them on your production instance? You click the plugin&#8217;s name, which usually links to the plugin&#8217;s wiki page, of course!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s possible for plugins to be published without a wiki page, or any other documentation aside from what&#8217;s provided in the plugin itself. This is really unfortunate, as users rely on wiki pages and similar documentation to learn more about a plugin before installing or upgrading it, like its features, limitations, or recent changes. Additionally, plugin wiki pages have a special section at the top that provides an automatically generated technical overview of the plugin, such as dependencies to other plugins, the minimum compatible Jenkins version, a list of developers, and links to the source code repository and issue tracker component. Everyone learning about or using a plugin benefits from a plugin wiki page and luckily, almost all plugins have one!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To ensure that <em>every</em> plugin has at least a basic wiki page with some documentation, we decided to only publish plugins in the Jenkins update center that have and link to a wiki page. To keep the impact to a minimum, we&#8217;re implementing this plan in several stages.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The first stage went live on June 1: All existing plugins that don&#8217;t have a (valid) wiki link got a wiki link <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/backend-update-center2/blob/master/src/main/resources/wiki-overrides.properties\">assigned by the update center</a> (a so-called 'override'), either to an existing wiki page if there was one, or a generic <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugin+Documentation+Missing\">\"This plugin has no documentation\" wiki page</a> otherwise. This ensures that no currently existing plugins get dropped from the update center at this point. Of course, <em>new</em> plugins that don&#8217;t provide a wiki URL and don&#8217;t have an override URL will not show up at all.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The second stage will be enabled later this year: We&#8217;re planning to remove all the overrides mentioned above. At this point, plugins may get removed from the update center if they still don&#8217;t specify a wiki URL. Of course this isn&#8217;t our goal, and we&#8217;ll try to work with plugin authors to prevent this from happening.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So what can you do? Check the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/backend-update-center2/blob/master/src/main/resources/wiki-overrides.properties\">current overrides list</a> to see whether the plugins you care about are affected, and if so, <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugin+Documentation+Missing#PluginDocumentationMissing-HowcanIhelp%3F\">see the landing page in the wiki</a> to learn what you can do. If you have any questions about this process not covered by the wiki, ask us on the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev\">Jenkins developers mailing list</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"0d6ef858-0d8a-57e0-9351-e15f94b7e563","title":"New Wiki URL Requirement for Plugins","date":"2015-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2015/06/22/new-wiki-url-requirement-for-plugins/","authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and, as security officer, leads the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck/","twitter":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0d6ef858-0d8a-57e0-9351-e15f94b7e563"}},
