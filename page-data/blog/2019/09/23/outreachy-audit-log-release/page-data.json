then they can use the <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j-audit/latest/log4j-audit/log4j-audit-maven-plugin/index.html\">Maven plugin</a> for generating the audit event classes for use in the plugin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The other major feature of this plugin is configuring where to output these audit logs.\nBy default, audit logs will be written in HTML files (rotated once per day) to <code>$JENKINS_HOME/logs/html/audit.html</code> which are viewable through the \"Audit Logs\" root action link.\nIn the system settings, a section for audit logging is added where the main audit log output can be configured.\nThis can initially be configured to output via either a JSON log file in <code>$JENKINS_HOME/logs/audit.log</code> by default or to a syslog server using RFC5424 encoding.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Overall, this experience has been rather interesting.\nBesides having an opportunity to mentor new contributors, Outreachy has helped open my eyes to the struggles that developers from around the world are dealing with which can be improved upon to help expand our communities.\nFor example, many countries do not have reliable internet or electricity, so the use of synchronous videoconferencing and other heavyweight, synchronous processes common to more corporate-style development are inadequate in this international context.\nThis doesn&#8217;t even begin to account for the difference in timezones which is not always an issue, though both problems are addressable by using asynchronous communication methods like chat and email.\nThis notion of asynchronous communication is an important aspect of the <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/\">Apache Way</a>, for example, which emphasises processes that allow for vendor neutral communities to form and thrive around a project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This mentoring project was valuable to myself as well.\nAs a software engineer myself, project management is not my specialty, so this gave me a great opportunity to develop my own PM skills and technical leadership.\nMy own typical discovery process for feature development involves experimenting directly with the code to see what features make sense to prioritize and which would take a vast effort to implement.\nChanging my own discovery process to avoid implementing the features myself was difficult to adjust to, though I did defer any of my own feature contributions to this plugin until after the initial release.\nIn order to appropriately scope the project, I still had to spend a bit of time reading through the Jenkins codebase to determine which tasks could be implemented simply (e.g., good newbie-friendly issues), which tasks might require changes to Jenkins itself (previously discovered to take too long for these relatively short Outreachy rounds), and which tasks would require intimate familiarity with Jenkins and would likely be infeasible for new developers to Jenkins.\nThanks to the work done in discovery and delivery, I&#8217;ve also identified potential features for Log4j itself which could be used in future versions of this plugin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Overall, I think we did a good job of balancing the scope of this project without spending too much time in any specific area.\nThe first release of this plugin is now available in the Jenkins Update Center.\nIn the future, I hope to learn more about developing Jenkins UI components so that we can create a more dynamic and Jenkins-like configuration page for choosing where logs are output.\nWhile I don&#8217;t intend on using this plugin for further Outreachy rounds, I do hope to see more interest in it over time as the more security-conscious users out there discover this new plugin.</p>\n</div>","id":"c729ed47-ed8f-594c-a5e9-e523cff8ffd2","title":"Audit Log Plugin for Jenkins Releases 1.0","date":"2019-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2019/09/23/outreachy-audit-log-release/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"https://musigma.blog/","github":"jvz","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Mathematician, software engineer, and free software evangelist.\nWorks for CloudBees on the <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/security/\">Jenkins Security Team</a> along with other Jenkins community work since 2018.\nPMC Chair of the <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/\">Apache Logging Services project</a> and Secretary for the <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/\">Apache Software Foundation</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"jvz","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Matt Sicker","slug":"/blog/author/jvz","twitter":"jvz"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2019/09/25/board-elections/","previous":"/blog/2019/09/10/introducing-the-jira-software-plugin-for-jenkins/","id":"c729ed47-ed8f-594c-a5e9-e523cff8ffd2"}},
