the elections, we discovered that CIVS is unable to support our large number of eligible voters.\nWe created a <a href=\"/blog/2019/11/08/board-elections/\">voter registration system</a> to identify voters and then registered those voters with CIVS.\nThe workaround required a slight voting delay.\nSpecial thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/olblak\">Olivier Vernin</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tracymiranda\">Tracy Miranda</a> who made it possible!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"whats-next-for-the-board\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#whats-next-for-the-board\"></a>What&#8217;s next for the board?</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In short term, the renewed board will focus on running the Jenkins governance processes (meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining next steps towards improving the project.\nOne of the priorities will be to organize knowledge and permission transfers to new board members so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThere are also pending activities like Jenkins' transition to <a href=\"https://cd.foundation/\">Continuous Delivery Foundation</a> which require attention from board members.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For longer term, there are some ideas floating around:\n  roadmap for key components,\n  long-anticipated architecture changes (UX revamp, pluggable storage, cloud native Jenkins),\n  adopting Linux Foundation best practices like <a href=\"https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/\">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>,\n  contributor onboarding,\n  etc.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for further evolvement of the Jenkins project,\nand the board could help to facilitate them in the community.\nThe ideas will be discussed in <a href=\"/mailing-lists/\">mailing lists</a> and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what&#8217;s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to do so!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"feedback\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#feedback\"></a>Feedback</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div
