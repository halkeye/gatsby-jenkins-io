As a beginner, translation might be\nthe easiest way to help the project. You don&#8217;t need to understand the whole context, even to create a ticket in the\nissue tracker system. Improvement of localization usually is minor. But some problems occurred soon,\nthere isn&#8217;t a native speaker of Chinese that could review my PRs. So, sometimes my PRs\nare delayed from being merged into master.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Some contributors told me that I can start a thread at the mailing list. Normally, discussing at the mailing list\nis the open source community way. We got a lot of ideas for the localization from there. As a result,\nwe achieved some goals that I&#8217;d like to share here.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"jep-216\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#jep-216\"></a>JEP-216</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Previously, language localization files were distributed in core and in each plugin.\nFor <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/216/README.adoc\">this proposal</a>, each language has a single localization plugin, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/localization-zh-cn-plugin\">Chinese Localization plugin</a>.\nFinally, <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/localization-support-plugin\">Localization Support Plugin</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/localization-zh-cn-plugin\">Chinese Localization plugin</a> are able to support\nall types of localization resource files. From the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/localization-zh-cn\">plugins website</a>,\nyou can see that there are already 13 000 installations.\nWe removed all Chinese localization files at the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4008\">PR-4008</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I really appreciate <a href=\"https://github.com/daniel-beck\">Daniel Beck</a> for helping me to add localization support,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitwiseman\">Liam Newman</a> helping me to review JEP-216, and many other community members.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"chinese-localization-sig\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#chinese-localization-sig\"></a>Chinese Localization SIG</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We believe that this SIG could help to improve Jenkins experience for Chinese users and gather more contributors\nfrom China. This SIG is responsible for maintaining the <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/zh/\">Chinese Jenkins website</a>,\npromoting the Jenkins community in China in the social media with WeChat account. We publish translated blog\narticles, Jenkins release notes, JAM or other events at the WeChat account. For now, there are 1800 followers that can\nread our news from the last half a year.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Especially, I want to say thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/donhui\">Wang Donghui</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/zacker330\">Zhai Zhijun</a>, and other <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/wechat/graphs/contributors\">contributors</a>. They did a lot of contributions.\nI wish I could see more and more folks join us.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"38964a5b-f559-5f17-9f39-7c96117907bb","title":"A Big Step of the Chinese Localization","date":"2019-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2019/05/09/chinese-localization/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2019/05/09/templating-engine/","previous":"/blog/2019/05/05/telemetry-success/","id":"38964a5b-f559-5f17-9f39-7c96117907bb"}},
