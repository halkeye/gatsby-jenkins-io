class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We have worked hard for this and it&#8217;s now here.\nWe are thrilled to announce <strong>full support for Java 11 in Jenkins</strong> starting from Jenkins 2.164 (released on Feb 10, 2019) and LTS 2.164.1 (ETA: March 14th).\nThis means you can now run your Jenkins controllers and agents with a Java 11 JVM.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Starting in June 2018, many events were organized to improve Jenkins code base and add Java 11 support.\nBeyond these events, Core/Plugins maintainers and many other contributors have worked hard to make sure they discover and solve as many issues as possible related to Java 11 support.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The effort to support Java 11 led to the creation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/211/README.adoc\">JEP-211: Java 10+ support in Jenkins</a>.\nIt also spurred the creation of the <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/sigs/platform\">Platform Special Interest Group</a> to coordinate the Java 11 work and other platform support efforts.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2

id=\"guidelines\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#guidelines\"></a>Guidelines</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In order to keep it simple, here is how you can start Jenkins on Java 11 using the Docker image.\nYou can select a Java 11 based image by suffixing the tag of the image with <code>-jdk11</code>.\nIf you are upgrading an existing instance please read the <a href=\"/doc/administration/requirements/upgrade-java-guidelines/\">Upgrading Jenkins Java version from 8 to 11</a> page before upgrading.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So you can run Jenkins on Java 11 with:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight nowrap\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\">docker run -p 50000:50000 -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:2.164-jdk11</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However, and as always, you can still start Jenkins with other methods.\nPlease see the more detailed documentation at <a href=\"/doc/administration/requirements/jenkins-on-java-11\">Running Jenkins on Java 11</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2

Guidelines</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This resource regroups the modifications which might need to be done in order to validate the compatibility of plugins for Java

X</a> project and the <a href=\"/projects/evergreen/\">Evergreen</a> project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So, even if this is a big deal to us, this is not the end of the story.\nIt is
