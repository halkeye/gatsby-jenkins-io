I want to make a summary of some activities in the last year.\nYou might already notice that more and more Chinese contributors emerge in the Jenkins community.\nWe have a GSoC champion who is <a href=\"https://github.com/cizezsy\">Shenyu Zheng</a>.\nHe is a great example for other students. With the effort of three skilled engineers,\nmany Jenkins users could learn the edge technologies and useful use cases.\nThey co-organized several Jenkins Meetups in a couple of cities in China.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There are two workshops about Jenkins and Jenkins X in the DevOps International Summit. <a href=\"https://github.com/rawlingsj\">James Rawlings</a> gave us a wonderful view of the Jenkins X. Many people start to know this project. The <a href=\"https://jenkins-x.io/zh/\">Chinese website of jx</a> would be helpful to those people.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>On November 3rd, 2018 the <a href=\"/blog/2019/01/09/jenkins-user-conference-china-shenzhen-update/\">Jenkins User Conference China(JUCC)</a> was hosted in Shenzhen. More than 200 attendees gathered at JUCC to share and discuss Jenkins, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Pipeline, and Agile.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There was a Jenkins workshop to teach users to develop a plugin in October. It was during the Hacktoberfest 2018. So some people got a beautiful T-shirt at this meetup. We&#8217;ll keep this event in 2019. I hope more users and developers could join us.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Thank you all folks. And other friendly contributors.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/logos/kongfu/256.png\" alt=\"Chinese KongFu\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Chinese is our main communication language. A large number of the Jenkins users are not a proficient English speaker.\nSo letting most of Chinese Jenkins users could easily use Jenkins as their CI/CD platform is the final mission of <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/sigs/chinese-localization/\">Chinese Localization SIG</a>.\nYou can find three participants on the page. But that&#8217;s not the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/cn.jenkins.io/graphs/contributors\">full list</a>.\nMore exciting thing is that <a href=\"https://github.com/alauda\">Alauda</a> giving a big support which as a startup company.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>WeChat is the greatest social media channel in China. WeChat has one billion users.\nAlmost everyone in China has a WeChat account. It must be a perfect place to publish articles and events.\nThere are over 1k people subscribed the <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2MzAwNzU3Nw==&amp;mid=2247483664&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=fa3fb0171d999d345105ce17f8175be7\">Jenkins official WeChat Subscription Account</a> in the last three months.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the new year, I&#8217;m looking forward to growing up with you all!</p>\n</div>","id":"9488675b-0d5a-5055-8c7d-1ab61e7ad642","title":"Jenkins new year in China","date":"2019-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2019/02/05/jenkins-new-year-in-china/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"LinuxSuRen","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Rick is a big fan of Jenkins, also as a contributor leading the Jenkins China community.</p>\n</div>","id":"linuxsuren","irc":null,"linkedin":"linuxsuren","name":"赵晓杰(Rick)","slug":"blog/author/linuxsuren","twitter":"LinuxSuRen"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2019/02/06/ssh-steps-for-jenkins-pipeline/","previous":"/blog/2019/02/01/windows-installers/","id":"9488675b-0d5a-5055-8c7d-1ab61e7ad642"}},
