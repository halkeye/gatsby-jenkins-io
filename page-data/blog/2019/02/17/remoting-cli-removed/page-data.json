(The CLI in default <code>-http</code> mode accesses Jenkins no differently than any other HTTP client.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>install-tool</code>, <code>set-build-parameter</code>, and <code>set-build-result</code> commands relied on a fundamentally insecure idiom that is no longer supportable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Command options or arguments which took either a local file or <code>=</code> for standard input/output (e.g., <code>install-plugin</code>, <code>build -p</code>, <code>support</code>) now only accept the latter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some features of relatively little-used plugins will no longer work, such as:</p>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/distfork\">DistFork</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/remote-terminal-access\">Remote Terminal Access</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-env-propagator\">Build Env Propagator</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","id":"a79ea93c-0082-5a4a-a338-9fde01ae88b1","title":"Remoting-based CLI removed from Jenkins","date":"2019-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2019/02/17/remoting-cli-removed/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"jglick","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jesse has been developing Jenkins core and plugins for years.\nHe is the coauthor with Kohsuke of the core infrastructure of the Pipeline system.</p>\n</div>","id":"jglick","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Jesse Glick","slug":"/blog/authors/jglick","twitter":"tyvole"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2019/02/21/credentials-masking/","previous":"/blog/2019/02/06/ssh-steps-for-jenkins-pipeline/","id":"a79ea93c-0082-5a4a-a338-9fde01ae88b1"}},
