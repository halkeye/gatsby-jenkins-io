It was\nan amazing experience getting to meet people from all over world who are trying\nto make the development and release process easier and more efficient. I enjoyed\nlearning more about industry tools, processes, and standards, and meeting CI/CD\nexperts and contributors in the open source community.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Below is a summary of my experience. Thank you to the Jenkins project and CloudBees for making\n my trip and attendance possible!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"day-1\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#day-1\"></a>Day 1</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Monday was the Continuous Delivery Contributor Summit, which focused on projects\nunder the CDF umbrella.  After checking in and grabbing my badge, I was able to\nmeet up with some of the Google Summer of Code org admins. It was great\nbeing able to actually meet them in person after talking to them over video\nconferencing and chats all summer!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/gsoc-plugin-management-tool/speakerbadge.jpg\" alt=\"Speaker Badge\" height=\"500\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Tracy Miranda started the summit out by introducing the <a href=\"https://cd.foundation/\">Continuous Delivery Foundation</a>,\nwhich aims to provide a vendor neutral home to help and sustain open source projects\nfocusing on all aspects of continuous delivery.  Currently, Jenkins, Tekton, Spinnaker,\nand JenkinsX have joined the foundation.  Project updates were given for Jenkins,\nTekton, and JenkinsX.  In the afternoon, attendees split into different groups for\nunconference sessions.  I presented my project to the Jenkins group.  Afterwards,\nthere was free time to chat with other attendees about my project and the other Jenkins\nprojects. Lastly, lightning talks were given before everyone headed to the contributor\nappreciation event to grab some food and drinks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/gsoc-plugin-management-tool/contributorsummit.jpg\" alt=\"Contributor Summit\" height=\"500\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"day-2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#day-2\"></a>Day 2</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I attended the Jenkins Pipeline Fundamentals Short Course in the morning. Even\nthough I&#8217;m working on a project for Jenkins, there&#8217;s still a lot I don&#8217;t know so\nI just wanted to try to learn more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/gsoc-plugin-management-tool/pipeline.jpg\" alt=\"Jenkins Pipeline Basics Session\" height=\"500\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A lot of the afternoon sessions filled up, so I spent the afternoon trying to meet\nother people at the conference, before heading to the keynote. The keynote\ntalked more about the CDF and some of the backstory behind its origin.  This year is also a big anniversary for Jenkins - it has now been\naround for 15 years.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/gsoc-plugin-management-tool/cdfkeynote.jpg\" alt=\"CDF Key Note\" height=\"500\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/gsoc-plugin-management-tool/cdforigin.jpg\" alt=\"CDF Origin\" height=\"500\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After the keynote, I checked out a Women in Tech mixer and\nthe opening of the exibition hall.

Shawn Ahmed of CloudBees talked about the\nchallenges of visibility into bottlenecks of the development process and Rajeev Mahajan\ndiscussed how HSBC tackled DevOps.  The rest of the day I attended different sessions\non container tooling, implementing CI/CD in a cloud native environment, running\nJenkins on Jenkins, and database DevOps.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/gsoc-plugin-management-tool/kubernetes.jpg\" alt=\"Session on Containers\" height=\"500\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After the sessions finished, I wandered\naround the expo until it closed, then joined some of the other conference attendees\nto have some fun at a ping pong bar nearby.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"day-4\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#day-4\"></a>Day 4</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The final and last day of the conference was probably my favorite.  The morning\nkeynote revealed that <a href=\"https://github.com/LinuxSuRen\">Zhao Xiaojie</a> had won an award for his work on Jenkins advocacy,\nsome other DevOps award panelists talked about their approaches to different challenges,\nthen David Stanke gave an enjoyable presentation about cloud native CI/CD. I was\nable to present my summer project and attend a few more sessions, including one\nabout DevOps at scale, and another about use cases for machine learning in CI/CD pipelines.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/gsoc-plugin-management-tool/presentation.jpg\" alt=\"Plugin Management Tool Presentation\" height=\"500\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The last keynote given by James Governor was a thoughtful look into the current and\nfuture states of tech. How does tech look like it will scale in the coming years\nin the U.S. and across the world? How can we make tech more inclusive and accessible?\nWhat can we do to minimize our environmental footprint?  In particular, his points\non welcoming people from a non-traditional computer science background resonated with\nme since I&#8217;m currently undergoing my own career transition to tech.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After the conference ended, I said goodbye to the remaining GSoC org admins before\nmeeting an old friend for dinner and bringing along some new friends I met at the\nconference.
