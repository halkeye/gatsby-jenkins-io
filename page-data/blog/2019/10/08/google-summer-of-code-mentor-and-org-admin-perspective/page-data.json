This was great\nand I wanted to share in hopes of encouraging more people to join.\nYou can learn more about the Google Summer of Code here: <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/\" class=\"bare\">https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"community-bonding\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#community-bonding\"></a>Community Bonding</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The first phase of the project is the community bonding phase. This is where the student and other mentors come together\nto lay out the plan for the project. It is important to set expectations and ensure that the student is well aware of\nwhat will take place and also made to feel welcome.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://jenkins.io/blog/authors/baymac\">Parichay Barpanda</a> was the student and he was super awesome from the get go. The project he was working on was the Gitlab\nBranch Source Plugin. More can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-branch-source-plugin\">jenkinsci/gitlab-branch-source-plugin</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>From the mentor side it was myself and Justin Harringa. Justin was just amazing throughout this project and I seriously\ncould not have done this without him. He was encouraging, empathetic and just all around great. I would gladly serve\nwith him again.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We laid out our plan and guidance and got to work.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"first-evaluations\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#first-evaluations\"></a>First Evaluations</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The first evaluation was quickly upon us and Parichay was ready!\nThe work he put in was nothing shy of amazing. We did our 1st demo and he really rocked it. A video of that demo can be\nfound on : <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij6ByZqI67o\">Youtube</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"second-evaluations\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#second-evaluations\"></a>Second Evaluations</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There was not much time to rest before we realized that phase II end was upon us but Parichay was ready. Again, he\nnailed it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>That demo can be found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnoObQqGhyM&amp;t=2380s\">here</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"mentors-submit-final-evaluations\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#mentors-submit-final-evaluations\"></a>Mentors Submit Final Evaluations</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We had our final evaluation and at this point Parichay was seasoned. He was getting issues assigned to him, working on\nlittle bug fixes and setting his roadmap for features. He absolutely blew Justin and I away.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Parichay&#8217;s final evaluation demo can be seen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMSbdGwGWp0&amp;t=905s\">here</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At the conclusion of the final demo&#8217;s, Justin and I met and went over Parichay&#8217;s final evaluation. At this point we had\nmet twice a week for several months, we have reviewed code daily, we had community involvement and most of all we had\nseen Parichay grow into a seasoned software developer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Justin and I were without a doubt passing Parichay on his entire body of work. I am actually tearing up typing this\nbecause I am so proud of Parichay.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"org-admin\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#org-admin\"></a>Org Admin</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Being an org admin for the 2019 Google Summer of Code project for the Jenkins organization was truly rewarding and couldn&#8217;t\nhave been accomplished without the help from Oleg Nenashev, Martin d&#8217;Anjou, Jeff Pearce and Lloyd Chang.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As an org admin we handled issues with mentors, community members and disagreements involving work. These items were only\na few and as a team we handled them accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We regularly met to discuss and plan. Coordinating and dealing with a project like Google Summer of Code is no small feat\nbut this team made it super easy and I am so thankful for them and all that I learned.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"closing\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#closing\"></a>Closing</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In looking back at this experience I am so grateful for the opportunity I was given. This was such a rewarding experience\nto not only be able to mentor but also be an org admin. Not only will I be back next year (we are already in the\nplanning stages) but I highly encourage people reading this to consider joining. You will not be disappointed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I am so thankful for all the students, mentors and fellow org admins. Your dedication to open source is so valued. You\nshowed and continue to show what this project is all about, and that is being welcoming, open and transparent. Helping\npeople grow as individuals while learning skills is what I love about this community.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Thank you to everyone and I hope your futures are bright!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"1aef3427-db0e-553e-8196-ae1a3516d783","title":"Google Summer of Code Mentor and Org Admin Perspective","date":"2019-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2019/10/08/google-summer-of-code-mentor-and-org-admin-perspective/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!
