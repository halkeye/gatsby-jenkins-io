In the talk, I&#8217;ll briefly present the history of the plugin, the vision for the future and current status. Then I&#8217;ll move to the demo section where I&#8217;ll show how easy it is to configure and run Jenkins with the help of the plugin.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"thinking-about-jenkins-security-mark-waite-wadeck-follonier\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#thinking-about-jenkins-security-mark-waite-wadeck-follonier\"></a>Thinking about Jenkins Security - <a href=\"https://github.com/MarkEWaite\">Mark Waite &amp; Wadeck Follonier</a></h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins security concepts, authorization, authentication and auditing, secure builds, agent security, configuration and administration security, auditing, and security best practices.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"docker-and-jenkins-as-code-dr-oleg-nenashev\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#docker-and-jenkins-as-code-dr-oleg-nenashev\"></a>Docker and Jenkins [as Code] - <a href=\"https://github.com/oleg-nenashev\">Dr. Oleg Nenashev</a></h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Configuration as Code plugin is a new milestone which enables managing Jenkins configurations via YAML. Together with Docker, this plugin offers many ways to produce ready-to-fly Jenkins images for any environments. In my talk, I will describe official controller and agent images offered by the Jenkins project. What’s inside them? How do you configure images with JCasC and Groovy hooks? How do you use these approaches together? And, finally, how do you simplify packaging of custom Jenkins images and define the entire system [as code]?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"can-jenkins-be-the-engine-of-mobile-devops-shashikant-jagtap\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#can-jenkins-be-the-engine-of-mobile-devops-shashikant-jagtap\"></a>Can Jenkins be the Engine of Mobile DevOps? - <a href=\"https://github.com/shashikantjagtap\">Shashikant Jagtap</a></h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In this talk, we will explore the following topics:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How mobile DevOps is different than web DevOps</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Challenges in mobile DevOps ( iOS and Android)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How Jenkins fits in mobile DevOps and CI/CD pipelines</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What Jenkins misses for mobile</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How we can make Jenkins better for mobile apps</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-cicd-pipeline-for-your-shared-libraries-roderick-randolph\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#creating-a-cicd-pipeline-for-your-shared-libraries-roderick-randolph\"></a>Creating a CI/CD Pipeline for Your Shared Libraries - <a href=\"https://github.com/roderickrandolph\">Roderick Randolph</a></h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At Capital One we run tens of thousands of CI/CD pipelines on Jenkins, leveraging the Jenkins Pipeline shared libraries extension to enable code reuse and decrease time to market for dev teams. A code change to our shared library goes live immediately and is consumed the next time a team triggers their project&#8217;s pipeline. So, why do we have such high confidence that a code change to our library won&#8217;t break a team&#8217;s pipeline? The answer: we&#8217;ve developed a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for our shared library.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>During this talk, you will learn how to create a fully automated pipeline for your shared libraries including how to develop tests, create canary releases, monitor for issues and quickly rollback changes to your shared library to achieve rapid delivery while minimizing any impact on dev teams.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"how-jenkins-builds-and-delivers-jenkins-in-the-cloud-brian-benz-tyler-croy\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#how-jenkins-builds-and-delivers-jenkins-in-the-cloud-brian-benz-tyler-croy\"></a>How Jenkins Builds and Delivers Jenkins in the Cloud - <a href=\"https://github.com/bbenz\">Brian Benz</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/rtyler\">Tyler Croy</a></h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Want to know how Jenkins builds Jenkins? Catch this session to see the real-life implementation of Jenkins’ development (at <a href=\"https://ci.jenkins.io\">ci.jenkins.io</a>) and delivery infrastructure in the cloud as it evolved from a mix of platforms to multi-platform VMs, containers and Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure.  Expect a frank discussion of issues that were encountered along the way, how the architecture has evolved and what’s on the roadmap.  We’ll share important tips and tricks for implementing your own Jenkins infrastructure on any cloud, based on Jenkins’ own implementation experience.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"declarative-pipeline-2019-tips-tricks-and-whats-next-liam-newman\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#declarative-pipeline-2019-tips-tricks-and-whats-next-liam-newman\"></a>Declarative Pipeline 2019: Tips, Tricks and What&#8217;s Next - <a href=\"https://github.com/bitwiseman\">Liam Newman</a></h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Are you using Declarative Pipeline?
