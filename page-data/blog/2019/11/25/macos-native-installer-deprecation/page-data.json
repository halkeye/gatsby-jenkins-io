are installers available for Linux distributions, Windows, macOS and other operating systems.\nThere are also installers provided by third parties.\nYou can find the list of these installers on the <a href=\"/download\">Downloads</a> page.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In this blog post, we announce the upcoming deprecation of the macOS native installer.\nWe will review the replacement options and the rollout plan.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"why\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why\"></a>Why?</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Maintaining installers is a significant maintenance effort for the project\nbecause installers require testing and, sometimes, specific platforms and environments for packaging.\nWhen installers lose relevance for the majority of the Jenkins audience, we remove them or handover maintenance to third parties on other areas.\nFor macOS, there are currently two types of packages: native installers with GUI for desktop versions and <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew packages</a>.\nSince Homebrew is now a defacto standard package manager for macOS users, from the Jenkins standpoint it made sense to deprecate the native installers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Why now?\nThere is ongoing work on automating Jenkins Core releases within the Jenkins infrastructure.\nLong story short, we are moving Jenkins release pipelines to Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure.\nThis environment does not offer macOS machines that are needed to produce native installers.\nIf you are interested to know more, there will be a <a href=\"https://sched.co/Uara\">How Jenkins Builds and Delivers Jenkins in the Cloud</a> talk presented by <a href=\"https://github.com/olblak\">Olivier Vernin</a> at <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/lisbon\">DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Europe in Lisbon</a> (use the <code>JWFOSS</code> code for a 30% discount!).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We could have used an external service for building macOS installers,\nbut it would have added an additional point of failure and implementation/maintenance overhead.\nSo we discussed it in the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/xc-lDVsr0bQ\">developer mailing list</a> and agreed that it is better to just deprecate and then remove the packages.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"replacing-native-installers\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#replacing-native-installers\"></a>Replacing native installers</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the case of macOS, there are two main alternatives available: managing the service manually or migrating to Homebrew packages.\nBefore doing a migration, we highly recommend backing up your instance.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"managing-jenkins-with-war-file-on-macos\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#managing-jenkins-with-war-file-on-macos\"></a>Managing Jenkins with WAR file on macOS</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If your Jenkins instance was previously set up with a native installer,\nto update Jenkins it will be enough to replace the <code>jenkins.war</code> file in the installation directory and restart the instance.\nThe services will keep running as it was configured before the migration.\nThe default installation directory is <code>/Applications/Jenkins/jenkins.war</code></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"managing-jenkins-with-homebrew\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#managing-jenkins-with-homebrew\"></a>Managing Jenkins with Homebrew</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Installing Jenkins with <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> is a way to go for those who want to install Jenkins using a package manager.\nThere are two Homebrew formulas for Jenkins: <a href=\"https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jenkins\">jenkins</a> for Weekly releases and <a href=\"https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jenkins-lts\">jenkins-lts</a> for LTS ones.\nThese packages are supported by a third party (Homebrew community),\nand they may be not as frequently updated as packages supported by the Jenkins project directly.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonitionblock note\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"icon\">\n<i class=\"fa icon-note\" title=\"Note\"></i>\n</td>\n<td class=\"content\">\nBefore doing a migration from macOS Native installers to HomeBrew, please make sure to backup your Jenkins instance.\nThere are no automatic migration tools available, and the installation may corrupt your <code>JENKINS_HOME</code> or service configuration files in edge cases.\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you switch to Homebrew, you will need to properly migrate the <code>JENKINS_HOME</code> data to the new location.\nWe do not provide an official migration guide, but it is possible to find some guidelines on the Web.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sample commands:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Install the latest Weekly version: <code>brew install jenkins</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Install a specific Weekly version: <code>brew install jenkins@YOUR_VERSION</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the Jenkins service: <code>brew services start jenkins</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restart the Jenkins service: <code>brew services restart jenkins</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update the Jenkins version: <code>brew upgrade jenkins</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For more information see the documentation
