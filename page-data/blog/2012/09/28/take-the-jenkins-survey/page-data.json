Obviously, the developers in the project deal with https://issues.jenkins.io[individual bug reports and feature requests] all the time, but sometimes those day-to-day issues distract you from a bigger picture. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nThis year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend. But we also http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2012/jenkins.2012-09-19-18.00.log.html#l-142[discussed what we wanted to ask] among ourselves and revised some more. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nThe tricky thing about being an open-source project is that it's not like some of us can actually decide what we'll be working on â€” in the end it's up to individual contributors to decide what they want to work on. So I can't make promises, but in a way, that's precisely why we'd like to get these objective, measurable, quantitative feedbacks. It lets us discuss how to solve the problem, instead of spending time discussing what the problem is. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nLast year, we've heard loud and clear that people wanted to see some UI improvements. So a bunch of us sit down at link:/blog/2012/02/21/fosdem-2012-recap/[FOSDEM], picked up several key UI improvements, and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/UI+Enhancements[we've actually delivered on those]. This year I hope to do the same. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nThe survey will close at the end of October, and if you participate, you'll get to see the results first. As an added incentive, CloudBees had pitched in a $100 Amazon gift card. So https://jenkins-ci.org/survey[please let your voice be heard].</pre>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"1759b910-aa31-5ef1-89c7-7ffbe58d9d18","title":"Take the Jenkins Survey!","date":"2012-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2012/09/28/take-the-jenkins-survey/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2012/11/14/sponsor-jenkins-bugs-with-freedom-sponsors/","previous":"/blog/2012/09/28/saturday-night-drink-up/","id":"1759b910-aa31-5ef1-89c7-7ffbe58d9d18"}},
