Specifically, we have https://fosdem.org/2013/[FOSDEM] and https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/[SCALE11x] in mind, in which there already are a fair amount of Jenkins contributors concentration. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nBeing an open-source project, Jenkins developers are highly dispersed, yet a lot gets done in the community through human relationships, just like any other organizations. This poses a challenge, because most of the contributors work on Jenkins on their spare times, and so people are on their own to travel to the shows, creating greater divides between those of us in the U.S., Europe, and in Asia. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nThis fundraising is a bit of experiment to see if it's worth the money. The goal is to sponsor two people who don't work on Jenkins full time to travel to those events (and hopefully present talks, although that's subject to the acceptance by conferences.) We'll also report back what came out of them. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nIf you think this is a worthy goal, https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=46160[please consider donating].
