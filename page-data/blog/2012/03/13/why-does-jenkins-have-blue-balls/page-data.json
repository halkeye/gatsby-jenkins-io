Jenkins is starting to get to be that age, having been started over 6 years ago.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>One of the most commonly asked questions, is about Jenkins' use of \"blue balls\" to indicate success by default. This is enough of an \"issue\" for some users that the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Green+Balls\">Green Balls</a> plugin is in the <a href=\"https://imod.github.com/jenkins-stats/svg/201201-top-plugins1000.svg\">list of top 10 installed plugins</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The reason behind our use of blue to indicate success has its basis in <a href=\"https://github.com/kohsuke\">Kohsuke&#8217;s</a> Japanese upbringing. The cultural differences were enumerated in a bug report comically titled \"s/blue/green/g\" (<a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-369\">JENKINS-369</a>):</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This response Kohsuke cited was taken <a href=\"https://groups.yahoo.com/group/ParthenonWeekly/message/232\">from this Q&amp;A thread</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Q.</strong> \"<em>Why do Japanese people say that they have blue traffic lights when they are really green?</em>\" --Question submitted by John Sypal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>A:</strong> According to the book, Japan From A to Z: Mysteries of Everyday\nLife Explained by James and Michiko Vardaman, the first traffic\nsignals in Japan were blue instead of green, but the blue lights were difficult to see from a long distance away so they were replaced with green ones. Vardaman says that the custom of referring to traffic lights is a holdover from those days.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This sounds like a good explanation, but the problem with it is that you will hear Japanese people refer to other green things (like\ncucumbers, spinach, and sometimes grass) as being blue as well. This\nis because historically, Japanese people considered green to be a\nshade of blue. For example, the Chinese character for blue,\npronounced ao is made up of two characters, iki (life) and i (well)\nand refers to the colour of plants which grow around a well, a colour between green and blue. When Chinese people see the character, they say it means green, but Japanese people say it means blue.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Japanese books on colours tell us that there are four tertiary colours: red, blue, white and black, and that all others are shades of those four main ones. Ao, therefore, is a sort of ideal blue, halfway between green and blue. The sky is said to be blue, but it is a different shade of ao than a traffic light is. Tree leaves are said to be green, but green is a shade of ao, like crimson is a shade of red.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In another interesting cultural difference relating\nto colour, Japanese children always colour the sun red instead of\nyellow.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>(<em>here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-369?focusedCommentId=120769&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-120769\">direct link to Kohsuke&#8217;s comment</a></em>)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Unfortunately it&#8217;s not for color blind users, although that&#8217;s a pretty convincing explanation. Jenkins has blue balls because in Japan, red means stop and blue means go!</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://portal.nifty.com/cs/catalog/portal_koneta/detail/1.htm?aid=090509099530\">this site</a></p>\n</div>","id":"ec9e39b5-c01c-5ce7-9aa1-cf5c17ad291f","title":"Why does Jenkins have blue balls?","date":"2012-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2012/03/13/why-does-jenkins-have-blue-balls/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
