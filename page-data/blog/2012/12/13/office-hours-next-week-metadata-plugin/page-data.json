This team from Sony Mobile has been known for several other popular plugins, including https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger[the Gerrit trigger plugin]. And I think this latest batch of plugins will not disappoint! +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAs I understand, this plugin is a https://wiki.jenkins.io/label/JENKINS/plugin-library[library plugin], which is primarily meant to be consumed by other plugins. With help of other plugins using this plugin, it can classify jobs and agents by adding metadata tags to them. This in turn enables more intelligent scheduling, views, access control, and so on. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nPersonally, I'm very interested in integrating https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/iOS+Device+Connector+Plugin[the iOS device connector plugin], so that one could say \"run this job on a Mac where iPad2 is connected\", etc. The other piece is to integrate this with https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/External+Resource+Dispatcher[the external resource dispatcher] so that Jenkins can grant exclusive device access to jobs while they are running so that tests don't end up trying to use the same device. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nIf you are a plugin developer, hopefully this gets you excited.
