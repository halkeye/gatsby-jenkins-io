Starting with August, we only have data on installations of version 1.368 or later - before that, reports go to the old Oracle-owned server, and we aren&#8217;t able to retrieve them. So that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll see a fairly hefty drop in install count, etc from July to August.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I haven&#8217;t had a chance to do any analysis to speak of on the data. I intend to get the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/aC6wIo\">plugin usage spreadsheet</a> updated n the next few days, but I wanted to make this data available to you all ASAP. If you come up with any interesting analysis or use of the data, please let us know!</p>\n</div>","id":"926494df-54e9-540e-8d37-ffcb912c1d4c","title":"Updated Usage Stats Available!","date":"2011-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2011/03/03/updated-usage-stats-available/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"abayer","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Andrew was a core committer to Hudson and the author of numerous plugins.</p>\n</div>","id":"abayer","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Andrew Bayer","slug":"/blog/author/abayer","twitter":"abayer"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2011/03/13/jenkins-hits-1-400/","previous":"/blog/2011/02/14/upcoming-jenkins-events-in-tokyo/","id":"926494df-54e9-540e-8d37-ffcb912c1d4c"}},
