Jenkins is here to help!  With the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Join+Plugin\">Join Plugin</a> you can do just that.

But you&#8217;re saying \"wait, I need to pass information around between the jobs.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We&#8217;ve got that one covered for you too with the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin\">Parameterized Trigger Plugin</a>.
