Some help by writing code, some help by answering other users questions, and some help by spreading words about Jenkins. If you've been wanting to contribute to the project but you haven't figured out how, this is one way to do it. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nAs a thank you, I'm writing a special \"friend of Jenkins\" plugin that I'd like to send out to those who have donated, so that you can show off your support on your Jenkins instance. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"literalblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"nowrap\"> +\nOnce again, please help us reach link:/donate/[our fundraising goal]. +\n +</pre>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"a47c24ef-60bf-5c20-aca6-c709970805f7","title":"Holiday appeal: please help Jenkins pay the project expense","date":"2011-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2011/12/05/holiday-appeal-please-help-jenkins-pay-the-project-expense/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2011/12/19/fundraising-drive-update-thank-you-everyone/","previous":"/blog/2011/12/02/community-contributed-localizations-to-be-bundled-in-jenkins-1-443/","id":"a47c24ef-60bf-5c20-aca6-c709970805f7"}},
