This past week, one of my long-running infrastructure projects has finally \"gone live,\" making downloads of plugins and packages faster than ever!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Some number of months ago I became frustrated with the download speeds reported by our international users, while the majority of Hudson&#8217;s infrastructure is all colocated inside of the United States, there is a <strong>huge</strong> number of Hudson users and developers who are both in Europe and Asia.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After discussing things with some of the folks that run <a href=\"https://download.opensuse.org\">download.opensuse.org</a>, a <a href=\"https://mirrorbrain.org\">MirrorBrain</a> powered redirector, I set out to build something similar. A mirroring network which could be easily managed and help direct users' downloads to the geographically closest and fastest mirror available.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"where-are-we-mirrored\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#where-are-we-mirrored\"></a>Where are we mirrored?</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Currently we have mirrors in a few locations within the United States, and one overseas:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Southwest U.S. (Utah) - <em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.xmission.com\">XMission</a></em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Midwest U.S. (Chicago) - <em>Thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.osuosl.org\">OSUOSL</a></em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Northeast U.S. (New York City) - <em>Thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.osuosl.org\">OSUOSL</a></em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Germany - <em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.aragost.com/\">aragost Trifork ag</a></em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"using-the-mirrors\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#using-the-mirrors\"></a>Using the mirrors</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you&#8217;ve updated or installed plugins from within Hudson lately, guess what! You&#8217;re already using mirrors! In fact, since we flipped the switch on January 7th, over <strong>800</strong> plugins and <strong>600</strong> <code>hudson.war</code> updates have been downloaded from the mirroring network!\nIf you&#8217;d like to download directly from the mirrors, you can browse on over to <a href=\"https://mirrors.hudson-labs.org\">mirrors.hudson-labs.org</a>, which will redirect your request for specific files to the appropriate mirror based on your IP address. It&#8217;s just that easy!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We are currently working with more providers to add additional mirrors, hopefully we&#8217;ll have an Asian mirror online within the next two weeks and if we&#8217;re lucky, we&#8217;ll find some more European mirrors too.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I would like to thank the <strong>immensely</strong> helpful and supportive engineers over at the <a href=\"https://www.osuosl.org\">OSUOSL</a> for offering gratis tech support, suggestions, and bandwidth to serve as our <em>primary</em> mirror.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n</div>","id":"d0d58bd3-e6a3-5580-8a1e-b6ac8bd2e732","title":"Installing plugins has always been easy, now it's fast too!","date":"2011-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2011/01/08/installing-plugins-has-always-been-easy-now-its-fast-too/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2011/01/11/hudsons-future/","previous":"/blog/2010/12/05/weekend-update-with-andrew-bayer/","id":"d0d58bd3-e6a3-5580-8a1e-b6ac8bd2e732"}},
