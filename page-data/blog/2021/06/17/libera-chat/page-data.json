Jenkins community does not have <strong>ANY</strong> official channels on Freenode.\nAll channels are either removed or left abandoned.\nWe no longer manage or control our channels.\nMost of the Jenkins IRC channel operators use IRCCloud,\nand hence they <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oleg_nenashev/status/1403265278566412288\">were banned</a> by the Freenode team on June 11th.\nOnly a few operators have reconnected since this event.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Taking the takeover of Freenode and hostile actions taken by the new management,\nwe can no longer guarantee any of the following:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Authenticity of registered users on Freenode.\nAll IRC accounts, cloaked or not, might have been taken over by the new Freenode management.\n Do not trust messages from the Jenkins contributor account IDs there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Confidentiality of private channels like <code>#jenkins-cert</code>.\nWe performed audit of the conversations there, and we believe there are no undisclosed security vulnerabilities referenced in the channel.\n After all, this IRC has been rather dormant for the last 18 months.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IRC User Passwords.\nAll passwords on Freenode IRC may be compromised in the future.\nWe strongly advise all users to rotate their passwords if they were used on Freenode IRC.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We have made backups of IRC channel conversations in the abandoned channels.\nIf you need to access the conversation history, please reach out to the Jenkins Infrastructure team.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#acknowledgements\"></a>Acknowledgements</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We thank the entire <a href=\"https://libera.chat/\">Libera Chat</a> team and all contributors who have worked on creating\na Freenode replacement for hundreds of open source communities using IRC.\nWithin just a month, a new platform has been created and adopted by almost all active projects.\nWe remember the Hudson to Jenkins renaming days when a similar mobilization happened in the Jenkins community,\nand we appreciate all the effort put by contributors.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Special thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels\nand our automation like the <a href=\"projects/infrastructure/ircbot/\">IRC Bot</a> used by the Jenkins hosting team.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"whats-next\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#whats-next\"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the Jenkins community we will keep using Libera Chat IRC and maintaining user and contributor channels there.\nOther Jenkins chat channels like <a href=\"/chat/#gitter\">Gitter</a> and <a href=\"/chat/#slack\">Slack</a> are unchanged.\nWe intend to gradually replace many of those channels with <a href=\"https://community.jenkins.io/\">community.jenkins.io</a>.\nThis is a new portal powered by <a href=\"https://www.discourse.org/\">Discourse</a>.\nThe service is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.discourse.org/\">Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc.</a>.\nIt is currently in preview, stay tuned for announcements.\nAs always, we will appreciate any suggestions and [feedback](<a href=\"https://community.jenkins.io/c/site-feedback/2)\"
