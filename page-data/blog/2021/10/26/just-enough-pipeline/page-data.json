Because the first rule of building an effective pipeline is to make sure you use agents.\nIf you&#8217;re using a Jenkins controller and haven’t defined any agents, then your first step should be to define at least one agent and use that agent instead of executing on the controller.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For the sake of maintaining scalability in your pipeline, the general rule is to avoid processing any workload on your controller.\nIf you&#8217;re running Jenkins jobs on the controller, you are sacrificing controller performance.\nSo, try to avoid using Jenkins controller capacity for things that should be passed off to an agent.\nThen, as you grow and develop, all of your work should be running agents.\nThis is why we always recommend setting the number of executors on the master to zero.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"use-just-enough-pipeline-to-keep-your-pipeline-scalable\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#use-just-enough-pipeline-to-keep-your-pipeline-scalable\"></a>Use Just Enough Pipeline to Keep Your Pipeline Scalable</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>All of this serves to highlight our overarching theme of “using just enough pipeline.”\nSimply put, you want to use enough code to connect the pipeline steps and integrate tools – but no more than that.\nLimit the amount of complex logic embedded in the Pipeline itself (similarly to a shell script), and avoid treating it as a general-purpose programming language.\nThis makes the pipeline easier to maintain, protects against bugs, and reduces the load on controllers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Another best practice for keeping your pipeline lean, fast, and scalable is to use declarative syntax instead of scripted syntax for your Pipeline.\nDeclarative naturally leads you away from the kinds of mistakes we’ve just described.\nIt is a simpler expression of code and an easier way to define your job.\nIt&#8217;s computed at the startup of the pipeline instead of executing continually during the pipeline.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Therefore, when creating a pipeline, start with declarative, and keep it simple for as long as possible.\nAnytime a script block shows up inside of a declarative pipeline, you should extract that block and put it in a shared library step.\nThat keeps the declarative pipeline clean.\nBy combining declarative with a shared library, that will take care of the vast majority of use cases you’ll encounter.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>That said, it’s not accurate to say that declarative plus a shared library will solve every problem.\nThere are cases where scripted is the right solution.\nHowever, declarative is a great starting point until you discover that you absolutely must use scripted.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Just remember, at the end of the day, you’ll do well to follow the adage: “Use just enough pipeline and no more.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"thanks-to-our-sponsor\"><a class=\"anchor\"
