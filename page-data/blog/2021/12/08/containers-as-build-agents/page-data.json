You&#8217;ll recall that Jenkins agents are the \"workers\" that perform operations requested by the Jenkins controller.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"videoblock\">\n<div class=\"title\">What is a Jenkins agent?</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<iframe width=\"852\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KghHJEz5no?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Many of you have been writing Jenkins pipelines for awhile, but you&#8217;ve been constrained by the tooling that&#8217;s available on your agent.\nBut what if you no longer had to be constrained by specific versions of specific tools on specific agents? And that you had full control over the tooling that you&#8217;re using just by having Docker available on your agents?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Well, that is exactly what&#8217;s possible by using containers as build agents for Jenkins.\nTo learn how to set up your agents with Docker, watch this step-by-step video.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"videoblock\">\n<div class=\"title\">How to Setup Docker Containers As Build Agents for Jenkins</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<iframe width=\"852\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ymI02j-hqpU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So why would you want to use a container as your build agent? As a pipeline author, it gives you the ability to define the tools and the specific versions of those tools that you want to use in your pipeline so that those items are not being mandated or managed by others.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Secondly, if in your environment, someone else has to install the tools for you on your agent, you can completely bypass all of that because you&#8217;re able to dynamically bring in the tools that you want or need at runtime.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Finally, it gives you the chance to experiment with different tools without having to make a long-term commitment to those tools.\nBecause if you have a dependency on someone else installing tools for you, that might take a long time.\nBut by running it as a container, you can test it out, and if it works, great! Then you have the option to work with somebody else to get static versions of those tools installed on your agents, or you can just stay with your container-based build agents.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"thanks-to-our-sponsor\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#thanks-to-our-sponsor\"></a>Thanks to our Sponsor</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Darin works for CloudBees.\nCloudBees helps Fortune 1000 enterprises manage and scale Jenkins.\nThanks to CloudBees for sponsoring the creation of this blog post.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"34b75ac0-1288-52a7-ad14-a7424b679e04","title":"Use Containers as Build Agents","date":"2021-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2021/12/08/containers-as-build-agents/","links":{"discourse":"*"},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/d2e4143b4f4937f53714ff368da3e6e0/19e71/darinpope.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/d2e4143b4f4937f53714ff368da3e6e0/77b35/darinpope.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/d2e4143b4f4937f53714ff368da3e6e0/d4a57/darinpope.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/d2e4143b4f4937f53714ff368da3e6e0/19e71/darinpope.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/d2e4143b4f4937f53714ff368da3e6e0/68974/darinpope.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/d2e4143b4f4937f53714ff368da3e6e0/ef6ff/darinpope.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/d2e4143b4f4937f53714ff368da3e6e0/8257c/darinpope.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/d2e4143b4f4937f53714ff368da3e6e0/6766a/darinpope.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/d2e4143b4f4937f53714ff368da3e6e0/22bfc/darinpope.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"darinpope","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Darin is a developer advocate for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>.\nHe is the co-host of the weekly <a href=\"https://www.devopsparadox.com/\">DevOps Paradox</a> podcast.\nHe also hosts regular livestream sessions on continuous integration and continuous delivery.\nRecordings of his live stream sessions are available on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/CloudBeesTV/search?query=Darin%20Pope\">CloudBees TV YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"darinpope","irc":null,"linkedin":"darinpope","name":"Darin Pope","slug":"/blog/authors/darinpope","twitter":"DarinPope"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/","previous":"/blog/2021/12/03/election-results/","id":"34b75ac0-1288-52a7-ad14-a7424b679e04"}},
