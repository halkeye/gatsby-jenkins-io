responded immediately by taking the affected server offline while we investigated the potential impact.\nAt this time we have no reason to believe that any Jenkins releases, plugins, or source code have been affected.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Thus far in our investigation, we have learned that the <a href=\"https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2021-08-25-1077906215.html\">Confluence CVE-2021-26084</a> exploit was used to install what we believe was a Monero miner in the container running the service.\nFrom there an attacker would not be able to access much of our other infrastructure.\nConfluence did integrate with our integrated identity system which also powers Jira, Artifactory, and numerous other services.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The trust and security in Jenkins core and plugin releases is our highest priority.\nWe do not have any indication that developer credentials were exfiltrated during the attack.\nAt the moment we cannot assert otherwise and are therefore assuming the worst.\nWe are taking actions to prevent releases at this time until we re-establish a chain of trust with our developer community.\nWe have reset passwords for all accounts in our integrated identity system.\nWe are improving the password reset system as part of this effort.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At this time, the Jenkins infrastructure team has permanently disabled the Confluence service, rotated privileged credentials, and taken proactive measures to further reduce the scope of access across our infrastructure.\nWe are working closely with our colleagues at the Linux Foundation and the Continuous Delivery Foundation to ensure that infrastructure which is not directly managed by the Jenkins project is also scrutinized.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/lNmas8aBRrI/m/eL3u7A6qBwAJ\">October 2019</a> we made the Confluence server read-only effectively deprecating it for day-to-day use within the project.\nAt that time, we began migrating documentation and changelogs from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\nThat migration has been ongoing, with hundreds of plugins and many other documentation pages moved from the wiki to GitHub repositories.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We are grateful for those of you who followed our <a href=\"/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities\">responsible disclosure procedure</a> and reached out to us about this vulnerability affecting the Jenkins project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We will continue to take proactive measures to improve the security of our infrastructure and encourage you to follow us on <a
