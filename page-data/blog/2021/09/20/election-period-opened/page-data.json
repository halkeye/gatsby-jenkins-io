I want us to continue on that path.\nThis is a tremendous opportunity for community members to influence the direction of the project for the next two years.\nTo make this year’s election even better, we slightly modified the process by leveraging our new community platform aka <a href=\"https://community.jenkins.io\">community.jenkins.io</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To participate in the election, we ask every Jenkins community member to have an account on <a href=\"https://community.jenkins.io\">community.jenkins.io</a>.\nYou can either reuse your Github account or create a new discourse account specific to <a href=\"https://community.jenkins.io\">community.jenkins.io</a>.\nThe second requirement is to be able to showcase at least one contribution done before the first of September 2021.\nAs mentioned on <a href=\"/participate/\">jenkins.io.io/participate</a>, they are many different ways to contribute to Jenkins and for many of them, it’s very difficult to measure.\nTherefore we’ll trust participants and will not require that they provide evidence of contribution as part of their voter registration. We reserve the right to ban the specific account from the election process if we identify abuse.\nThe election works in three stages:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p>Identify voters and nominees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Voting period</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Announce results</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"voters\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#voters\"></a>Voters</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To invite participants to vote, we need a list of email’s addresses that we would share with the <a href=\"https://civs.cs.cornell.edu\">Condorcet Internet Voting Service</a>.\nTherefore we ask every community member who matches the requirements to join the group <a href=\"https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-voter\">election-voter</a> on <a href=\"https://community.jenkins.io\">community.jenkins.io</a> .\nThe group will be open for joining during the registration period after we’ll close registration during the voting period.\nWe’ll use emails from the “election-voter” group members.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"nominees\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#nominees\"></a>Nominees</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>During the same period, we invite every community member to nominate candidates by sending a message to the group <a href=\"https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-committee\">election-committee</a> mentioning the position and the motivation.\nOn the 31 of October, the nomination period will end.
