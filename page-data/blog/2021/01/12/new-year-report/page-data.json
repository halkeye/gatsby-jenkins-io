released 19 advisories for the Jenkins core, plugins and other components.\nIn total 198 vulnerabilities were fixed, and 72 plugin vulnerabilities were announced without a fix at the time of advisory publishing.\nAs a project, we are receiving a continuous flow of new reports and continue to provide corrections.\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were the most popular type this year, followed by unprotected credentials.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There have also been developer tooling improvements,\nincluding <a href=\"/blog/2020/11/04/codeql/\">GitHub CodeQL evaluation</a> for targeted security issues search\nand <a href=\"/blog/2020/03/02/findsecbugs/\">Find-Sec-Bugs adoption</a> for static analysis of the plugin and Jenkins core code.\nAlong with wider

href=\"#documentation\"></a>Documentation</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Documentation SIG is working on creating more documentation for Jenkins on different platforms,\nincluding cloud platforms.\nJenkins on Kubernetes was one of the key stories this year for the SIG,\nalong with documentation migration to jenkins.io and wider adoption of Documentation-as-code in plugins.\n95% of the 200 most installed Jenkins plugins have moved to \"documentation as code\" or have a pending pull request with updates.\nIn total, almost 600 plugins have already been migrated.\nThere were major updates in Jenkins documentation on jenkins.io, with a lot of content being moved from the old Jenkins Wiki.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>2020 was the first year when Jenkins participated in Google Season of Docs (GSoD).\nThis program brings together open-source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nThis year’s student, <a href=\"/blog/authors/zaycodes\">Zainab Abubakar</a>,\ndid an amazing job documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nNow Jenkins users can find official documentation about deploying and scaling Jenkins in Kubernetes.\nSee the project report by Zainab <a href=\"/blog/2020/12/04/gsod-project-report/\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"jenkins-release-automation\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#jenkins-release-automation\"></a>Jenkins Release Automation</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins project has delivered weekly and long term support releases since it was formed in 2011.\nThose releases were delivered by Kohsuke Kawaguchi from his release infrastructure.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Beginning in April 2020, those releases are delivered by the new release automation setup.\nIt is hosted within the Jenkins’ Kubernetes cluster, with fully automated management and continuous delivery of services within the setup.\nWe transitioned to new build processes, new code signing certificates, and new release automation jobs.\nThanks to Olivier Vernin and all Infrastructure sub-project contributors for the successful completion of the release automation project!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Moreover, there is ongoing work on continuous delivery of Jenkins plugins (<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/229/README.adoc\">JEP-229</a>) and on re-designing other Jenkins instances within the project (infra-ci, trusted-ci, and ci.jenkins.io for plugins).\nIn the next few months these stories should provide Jenkins contributors with a modern environment for CI and CD of all Jenkins components.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"terminology-updates\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#terminology-updates\"></a>Terminology updates</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Since July, we have officially replaced the old \"master\" terminology with the \"controller\" term.\nIt is a follow-up to the \"agent\" terminology introduced in 2016.\nWe have also deprecated usages of the “blacklist/whitelist” terminology in all components.\nCurrently the community is working on the cleanup of the remaining occurrences in the codebase and documentation, and we invite everyone to contribute.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As a part of the terminology cleanup, last spring we announced the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.\nAs a reminder, it does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>See more information about terminology

Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc. THANKS A LOT TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"whats-next\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#whats-next\"></a>What’s next?</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Technical changes.</strong> 2021 will be another busy year for the Jenkins community.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want Jenkins to succeed.\nThere are many areas on the <a href=\"/project/roadmap/\">roadmap</a>: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nThere will also be a continued cleanup of old dependencies and technical debt.\nSeveral key changes are expected to land in the March LTS baseline: update to Spring Security, XStream unforking, JQuery update, etc.(<a href=\"/blog/2020/11/10/major-changes-in-weekly-releases/\">announcement</a>).\nIn addition to that, we will keep working on expanding platform support in Jenkins, including provisioning support for new Java versions and official images for more architectures like Arm.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Documentation.</strong> Documentation efforts will continue in the next year,\nwith a focus on documenting Jenkins usage on modern platforms and and automation use-cases.\nWide adoption of documentation-as-code will also continue for plugins By this time almost 600 plugins have been migrated, but there are hundreds more plugins to go.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Security.</strong> Another important area is Jenkins security. Automation tools like Jenkins are a key part of the software delivery process in organizations, and their security is essential for the security of products.\nMisconfigured or outdated systems are a common attack vector, but there are also areas for improvement on the project’s side.\nBe sure there will be security advisories and vulnerability fixes in 2021.\nWe plan to keep adopting best security development and software delivery practices, and to improve dependency management and developer tools in the project. These areas will be in the spotlight for the project next year.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Events.</strong> Next month we will participate in <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, and there will be a virtual Jenkins stand there.\nThere will also be a CI/CD devroom.\nIf you are interested to meet Jenkins contributors, it is a great opportunity. We also plan to continue all outreach programs and on onboarding more contributors.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas (<a href=\"/blog/2020/12/16/call-for-mentors/\">announcement</a>).\nWe are also ready to consider other non-coding project ideas as a part of CommunityBridge.\nIf you are interested, please contact the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"join-us-in-2021\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#join-us-in-2021\"></a>Join us in 2021!</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We are always looking for more contributors, regardless of the profile and experience.\nJenkins is a vast ecosystem which includes many modern technologies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We invite Jenkins users and contributors to participate in the community and to move these initiatives forward!\nJoin us in the <a href=\"/mailing-lists/\">mailing lists</a> and <a href=\"/sigs/\">special interest groups</a>,</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"ae6a8999-441c-5627-ae10-15ce8370007b","title":"2020 A Year Like No Other","date":"2021-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2021/01/12/new-year-report/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/markyjackson-taulia.png"},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!
