I am a second year student at Maseno\nUniversity. I am currently specializing on Ruby on Rails and trying to learn\nPython. I recently started contributing to Open source projects.My major\ncontribution was at Mozilla, where I worked with the QA for Cloud services. I did\nmanual and automated tests for various cloud services. I wrote documentation\ntoo. Above that, I am competent and I am always passionate about what I get my\nhands on.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"project-summary\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#project-summary\"></a>Project summary</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Currently Jenkins plugin documentation is being stored in Confluence. Sometimes\nthe documentation is scattered and outdated. In order to improve the situation we\nwould like to follow the documentation-as-code approach and to put docs to\nplugin repositories and then publish them on the project website using the\nawestruct engine. The project aims an implementation of a documentation\ncontinuous deployment flow powered by Jenkins and Pipeline Plugin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The idea is to automatically pull in the README and other docs from GitHub, show\nchangelogs with versions and releases dates. I will be designing file templates\nthat will contain most of the  docs information that will be required from\nplugin developers. Initially the files will be written in\n<a href=\"https://asciidoctor.org/\">AsciiDoc</a>. Plugin developers will get a chance to\nreview the templates. The templates will be prototyped by various plugin\ndevelopers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The docs that will be automatically pulled from github and will be published on\n<a href=\"https://jenkins.io/\">Jenkins.io</a> under the Documentation section.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>My mentors are <a href=\"https://github.com/rtyler\">R.Tyler</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/batmat\">Baptiste Mathus</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I hope to achieve this by 25th June when we will be having our mid-term\nevaluations.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I will update more on the progress.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"links\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#links\"></a>Links</h3>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/project/5120513768685568/details/\">Gsoc Page</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Google+Summer+Of+Code+2016\">Jenkins Gsoc Page </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/kNZMOsF_ueA\">Mailing List discussion on Jenkins-Developers</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@anyango_cynthia\">My blog on Medium</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"2ec37d75-53e9-562c-9bbb-de2a06ecbafd","title":"GSOC Project Intro: Automatic Plugin Documentation","date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/06/01/gsoc-automatic-plugin-documentation/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"anyangocynthia","html":"","id":"cynthia","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Cynthia Anyango","slug":"/blog/authors/cynthia/","twitter":"annyanngo"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2ec37d75-53e9-562c-9bbb-de2a06ecbafd"}},
