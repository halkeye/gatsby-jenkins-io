While your Spot instances may be\nterminated when EC2’s spare capacity declines, you can automatically replenish these instances and\nmaintain your target capacity using\n<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EC2 Spot fleets</a>. As each\ninstance type and Availability Zone provides an alternative capacity pool, you can select multiple\nsuch pools to launch the lowest priced instances currently available by launching a Spot\nfleet on the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2sp/v1/spot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon EC2 Spot Requests</a> console\nor using the AWS CLI/SDK tools.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In this walkthrough, we’ll show you how to configure Jenkins to automatically scale a fleet of Spot\ninstances up or down depending on the number jobs to be completed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"request-an-amazon-ec2-spot-fleet\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#request-an-amazon-ec2-spot-fleet\"></a>Request an Amazon EC2 Spot fleet</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To get started, login to <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon EC2 console</a>, and click on <strong>Spot Requests</strong>\nin the left hand navigation pane.
