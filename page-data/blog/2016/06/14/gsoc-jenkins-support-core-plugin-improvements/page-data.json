Therefore it&#8217;s possible to have a bunch of them over the entire lifetime after the plugin installing the plugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On demand bundles: These bundles are generated from the root \"Support\" action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However current support-core plugin is not much user friendly. The object of this project is to make it more user friendly by adding some features which make a sophisticated environment for the user who use support plugin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In this project scope, there are three features and improvements we are going to consider.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p>Ease the bundles management by the administrator (<a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-33090\">JENKINS-33090</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adding an option to anonymize customer labels (strings created by the user such as name of a job, folder, view, agent, and template etc). (<a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-33091\">JENKINS-33091</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allowing user to create an issue and submit a bundle into the OSS tracker using the support-core plugin.

When considering doing that, anonymizing user created labels (texts) comes to the front.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"adding-an-option-to-anonymize-customer-labels\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#adding-an-option-to-anonymize-customer-labels\"></a>Adding  an option to anonymize customer labels</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The following functions will be implemented under this taks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p>Creating randomized tokens for labels created by users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Producing a mapping for those labels.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Substituting encoded labels into all the files included in the support bundle.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When creating randomized tokens, it would be much useful and effective if we can create those tokens in a way they make sense to humans. (i.e. readable to humans). For that, I am hoping to use a suitable java library to create human friendly random tokens. One of such libraries is <a href=\"https://github.com/kohsuke/wordnet-random-name\">wordnet-random-name</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However in order to substitute randomized tokens, all files included in the bundle should be read. This can become inefficient when bundle consists of large number of files.  Therefore it&#8217;s important to follow an optimized method for this task.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"references\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#references\"></a>References</h3>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1052sUGFxcDfUHNZFNeQ1FAR61ZB4tJb-GxdW1L3FSC8/edit?usp=sharing\">Initial proposal of the project</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/minudika/support-core-plugin\">Project repository</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"0e5d650b-c2ea-591f-9965-564c0e2df2c3","title":"GSoC Project Intro: Support Core Plugin Improvements","date":"2016-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/06/14/gsoc-jenkins-support-core-plugin-improvements/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"minudika","html":"","id":"minudika","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Minudika Malshan","slug":"blog/author/minudika","twitter":"minudika"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2016/06/14/jenkins-world-agenda/","previous":"/blog/2016/06/13/june-jenkins-events/","id":"0e5d650b-c2ea-591f-9965-564c0e2df2c3"}},
