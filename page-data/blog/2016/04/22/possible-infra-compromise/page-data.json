This compromise could have taken advantage of, what\ncould be categorized as, an attempt to target contributors with elevated\naccess. Unfortunately, when facing the uncertainty of a <em>potential</em> compromise,\nthe safest option is to treat it as if it were an actual incident, and react\naccordingly. The machine in question had access to binaries published to our\nprimary and secondary mirrors, and to contributor account information.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Since this machine is not the source of truth for Jenkins binaries, we verified\nthat the files distributed to Jenkins users: plugins, packages, etc, were not\ntampered with. We cannot, however, verify that contributor account information\nwas not accessed or tampered with and, as a proactive measure, we are issuing a\npassword reset for all contributor accounts. We have also spent significant effort\nmigrating all key services off of the potentially compromised machine to\n(virtual) hardware so the machine can be re-imaged or decommissioned entirely.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"what-you-should-do-now\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-you-should-do-now\"></a>What you should do now</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you have ever filed an issue in <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io\">JIRA</a>,\nedited a <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io\">wiki</a> page, released a plugin or\notherwise created an <a href=\"https://accounts.jenkins.io\">account</a> via the Jenkins\nwebsite, you have a Jenkins community account. You should be receiving a\npassword reset email shortly, but if you have re-used your Jenkins account\npassword with other services we strongly encourage you to update your passwords\nwith those other services.  If you&#8217;re not already using one, we also encourage\nthe use of a password manager for generating and managing service-specific\npasswords.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonitionblock note\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"icon\">\n<i class=\"fa icon-note\" title=\"Note\"></i>\n</td>\n<td class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The generated password sent out is <strong>temporary</strong> and will expire if you do not\nuse it to update your account.

That helps address the immediate problem but doesn&#8217;t put\nguarantees in place for the future. To help prevent potential issues in the\nfuture we&#8217;re taking the following actions:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incorporating more security policy enforcement</strong> into our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra\">Puppet-driven infrastructure</a>. Without a\nconfiguration management tool enforcing a given state for some legacy services,\nuser error and manual mis-configurations can adversely affect project security.\nAs of right now, all key services are managed by Puppet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Balkanizing our machine and permissions model</strong> more. The machine affected was\nliterally the first independent (outside of Sun) piece of project\ninfrastructure and like many legacy systems, it grew to host a multitude of\nservices. We are rapidly evolving away from that model with increasing levels\nof user and host separation for project services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In a similar vein, we have also introduced a trusted zone in our\ninfrastructure which is not routable on the public internet, where sensitive\noperations, such as generating update center information, can be managed and\nsecured more effectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>We are performing an infrastructure permissions audit</strong>. Some portions of our\ninfrastructure are 6+ years old and have had contributors come and go. Any\ninactive users with unnecessarily elevated permissions in the project\ninfrastructure will have those permissions revoked.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I would like to extend thanks, on behalf of the Jenkins project, to\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a> for their help in funding and\nmigrating this infrastructure.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you have further questions about the Jenkins project infrastructure, you can\njoin us in the <code>#jenkins-infra</code> channel on <a href=\"https://freenode.net\">Freenode</a>\nor in an Infrastructure Q&amp;A session I&#8217;ve scheduled for next Wednesday (April\n27) at 20:00 UTC (12:00 PST).</p>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"be010022-b98d-5767-afad-a1578cc4e23f","title":"Possible Jenkins Project Infrastructure Compromise","date":"2016-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/04/22/possible-infra-compromise/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
