He also\nserves as the CloudBees Product Marketing Manager for Jenkins.\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image right\"><img src=\"/images/logo_128.png\" alt=\"logo 128\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Last fall CloudBees asked attendees at the Jenkins User Conference – US West\n(JUC), and other in the Jenkins community to take a survey.  Almost 250 people\ndid – and thanks to their input, we have results which provided interesting\ninsights into how Jenkins is being used.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Back in 2012, at the time of the last community survey, 83% of respondents felt\nthat Jenkins was mission-critical. By 2015, the percentage saying that\nJenkins was mission-critical was 92%. Additionally, echoing the\nimportance of Jenkins, 89% of respondents said their use of Jenkins had\nincreased over the last year, while 11% said it had stayed the same. 0%\nsaid that it had decreased.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The trend in the industry over the last couple of years has been to adopt\ncontinuous delivery (CD), thus pushing automation further down the pipeline –\nfrom development all the way into production.  Jenkins being an automation\nengine applicable to any phase of the software delivery lifecycle, is readily\nsupporting this trend. Jenkins' extensible architecture and unparalleled plugin\necosystem enables integration with and orchestration of practically any tool in\nany phase of software delivery.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The trend towards adoption of CD is clearly reflected amongst the community: 59%\nof respondents are using Jenkins for continuous integration (CI), but an\nadditional 30% have extended CI into CD and are manually deploying code to\nproduction.  Finally, 11% are practicing continuous deployment – they have\nextended CI to CD and are deploying code automatically into production.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Another trend tied to the adoption of CD and DevOps is the frequent deployment\nof incremental releases to production. 26% of those respondents using continuous\ndelivery practices are deploying code at least once per day.  Another 37% are\ndeploying code at least once per week.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In keeping with the move to CD, 30% of survey takers are already using the\nrelatively new <a href=\"/solutions/pipeline\">Pipeline</a> plugin to automate their\nsoftware delivery pipelines.  Of those not using the Pipeline plugin, 79% plan\nto adopt it in the next 12 months.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Survey respondents are also using Jenkins for many different activities.  97% of\nsurvey takers use it for \"build\" – no surprise, since that is where Jenkins got\nits start - but 58% now also use it for their deployment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image left\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2015-community-survey/2016-survey-blog-strongbutler.png\" alt=\"2016 survey blog strongbutler\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When the 2012 community survey was conducted, container technology was not as\nwell understood as it is today,  and many didn&#8217;t know what a “Docker” was. A\nshort four years later, 96% of survey respondents who use Linux containers are\nusing Docker.  Container technology has seen impressive adoption and arguably is\nrevolutionizing the way application infrastructure is delivered.  When coupled\nwith Jenkins as an automation engine, containers help accelerate software\ndelivery by providing rapid access to lightweight environments.  The Jenkins\ncommunity has recognized and embraced the power of containers by\n<a href=\"/solutions/docker\">providing plugins for Docker</a> and Kubernetes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins improvements which survey respondents desired the most were\nquality/timely bug fixes, a better UI and more documentation/examples.\nInterestingly, Jenkins 2.0 - which is just about to officially launch,\nprovides UI improvements and the new Jenkins.io website\nprovides improved, centralized documentation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image right\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2015-community-survey/2016-survey-blog-bb8.png\" alt=\"2016 survey blog bb8\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Finally, the respondents favorite Star Wars character was R2-D2, followed by\nObi-Wan and Darth Vader. Yoda and Han Solo also got a fair amount of votes. The\nvotes for Jar-Jar Binks and Jabba the Hutt left us puzzled. Notably, BB-8 had a\nwrite-in vote despite the fact the new Star Wars movie hadn&#8217;t been released yet.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As to where the community is headed, our prediction is that by the next Jenkins Community Survey:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>More Jenkins users will have transitioned from just continuous\nintegration to continuous delivery with some evening practicing continuous\ndeployment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pipeline plugin adoption and improvements will continue, leading to\npipeline-as-code becoming an essential solution for automating the software\n(and infrastructure) delivery process</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There will be a significant increase in use of the Docker plugin to support\nelastic Jenkins infrastructure and continuous delivery of containers using\nsoftware development best practices</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>BB-8 will be the next favorite Star Wars character! &lt;3</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>See you at Jenkins World, September 13-15, in Santa Clara, California!\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home\">Register now</a> for the largest Jenkins event on the planet in 2016 – and get the Early Bird discount.
