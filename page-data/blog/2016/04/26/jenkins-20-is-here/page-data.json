It is quite remarkable for a project that\noriginally started as a hobby project under a different name. I&#8217;m very proud.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Around this time last year,\n<a href=\"/blog/2015/02/09/jenkins-celebration-day-is-february-26/\">we&#8217;ve</a>\ncelebrated 10 years, 1000 plugins, and 100K installations. That was a good time\nto retrospect, and we started thinking about the next 10 years of Jenkins and\nwhat&#8217;s necessary to meet that challenge.  This project has long been on a\nweekly \"train\" release model, so it was useful to step back and think about a\nbig picture.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>That is where three pillars of Jenkins 2.0 have emerged from.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>First, one of the challenges our users are facing today is that the automation\nthat happens between a commit and a production has significantly grown in its\nscope. Because of this, the clothing that used to fit (aka \"freestyle project\",\nwhich was the workhorse of Jenkins) no longer fits. We now need something that\nbetter fits today&#8217;s use cases like \"continuous delivery pipeline.\" This is why\nin 2.0 we&#8217;ve added the <a href=\"/doc/pipeline\">pipeline capability</a>. This 2 year old effort allows you\nto describe your chain of automation in a textual form. This allows you to\nversion control it, put it alongside your source tree, etc. It is also actually\na domain specific language (DSL) of <a href=\"http://groovy-lang.org/\">Groovy</a>, so when your pipeline grows in\ncomplexity/sophistication, you can manage its complexity and keep it\nunderstandable far more easily.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Second, over time, Jenkins has developed the \"assembly required before initial\nuse\" feeling. As the project has grown, the frontier of interesting development\nhas shifted to plugins, which is how it should be, but we have left it up to\nusers to discover &amp; use them. As a result, the default installation became very\nthin and minimal, and every user has to find several plugins before Jenkins\nbecomes really functional. This created a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice\">paradox of choice</a> and unnecessarily\nhurt the user experience. In 2.0, we reset this thinking and tried to create\nmore sensible out of the box experience that solves 80% use cases for 80% of\npeople. You get something useful out of the box, and you can get some\nconsiderable mileage out of it before you start feeling the need of plugins.\nThis allows us to focus our development &amp; QA effort around this base\nfunctionality, too. By the way, the focus on the out of the box experience\ndoesn&#8217;t stop at functionality, either. The initial security setup of Jenkins is\nimproved, too, to prevent unprotected Jenkins instances from getting abused by\nbotnets and attacks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Third, we were fortunate to have a number of developers with UX background\nspend some quality time on Jenkins, and they have made a big dent in improving\nvarious parts of Jenkins web UI. The setup wizard that implements the out of\nthe box experience improvement is one of them, and it also includes other parts\nof Jenkins that you use all the time, such as job configuration pages and new\nitem pages. This brings much needed attention to the web UI.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As you can see, 2.0 brings a lot of exciting features on the table, but this is\nan evolutionary release, built on top of the same foundation, so that your\nexisting installations can upgrade smoothly. After this initial release, we&#8217;ll\nget back to our usual weekly release march.  Improvements will be made\nto those pillars and others in coming months and years continuously.

There are\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/graphs/contributors\">too many of you</a>\nto thank individually, but you know who you are. I wanted to thank CloudBees in\nparticular for sponsoring the time of many of those people. Ten years ago, all I\ncould utilize was my own night &amp; weekend time. Now I&#8217;ve got a team of smart\npeople working with me to carry this torch forward, and a big effort like 2.0\nwouldn&#8217;t have been possible without such organized effort.</p>\n</div>","id":"8d1a1951-ad97-5021-a398-24ee5d471516","title":"Jenkins 2.0 is here!","date":"2016-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/04/26/jenkins-20-is-here/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2016/05/10/jenkins-20-vjam/","previous":"/blog/2016/04/22/pipeline-2.x/","id":"8d1a1951-ad97-5021-a398-24ee5d471516"}},
