In\nmany cases when people talk about \"scaling Jenkins\" they&#8217;re talking about\n\"Jenkins as a Service\" or \"Continuous Delivery as a Service\" which introduces a\nmuch broader scope, and also more organization-specific requirements, to the\nproblem.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>One of my favorite parts of a big conference like\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home\">Jenkins World</a> is getting to\nsee how other people are solving similar problems at different organizations,\nin essence:\n\"<a href=\"https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/120739/a-peek-into-the-sausage-factory\">how\nthe sausage is made</a>.\" This year&#8217;s Jenkins World will be no different, with a number\nof sessions by developers and engineers from the companies leading the way,\nscaling continuous delivery and Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonitionblock caution\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"icon\">\n<i class=\"fa icon-caution\" title=\"Caution\"></i>\n</td>\n<td class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Register for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home\">Jenkins World</a> in\nSeptember with the code <code>JWFOSS</code> for a 20% discount off your pass.</p>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the realm of \"scaling Jenkins\" the following sessions stand-out to me as\n\"must-attend\" for those interested in the space:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsops-initiative-streamline-and-automate-jenkins\"><strong>JenkinsOps:\nAn Initiative to Streamline and Automate Jenkins</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><em>September 14th 4:15 PM - 5:00 PM, Exhibit Hall A-1</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image right\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/scaling-jenkins-at-jenkinsworld/159px-National_Public_Radio_logo.svg.png\" alt=\"159px National Public Radio logo.svg\"></span>\nNPR’s Digital Media team uses Jenkins to build, test and deploy code to various\nstaging and production environments.

But which cluster technology should be used? Docker\nSwarm? Apache Mesos? Kubernetes? How do they compare? All of them can be used\nto dynamically run jobs inside containers. This talk will cover these main\ncontainer clusters, outlining the pros and cons of each, the current state of\nthe art of the technologies and Jenkins support.

Next, we\nwill do experiments scaling some individual sub-components of Jenkins in\nisolation and see what challenges we will face when integrated. The famous\nlarge, distributed systems undoubtedly faced problems scaling - and we can\nlearn from them, too. The result will be recipes for building Jenkins\nclusters with different scaling capabilities. After all of this, you can\nbuild the biggest Jenkins cluster in the world…or maybe just make your own\nJenkins cluster more efficient.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n&#8212; Stephen Connolly of CloudBees\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-splunk-and-splunking-jenkins\"><strong>Jenkins at\nSplunk and Splunking Jenkins</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><em>September 15th 3:45 PM - 4:30 PM, Exhibit Hall A-1</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image right\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/scaling-jenkins-at-jenkinsworld/splunk-logo-300x100.gif\" alt=\"splunk logo 300x100\"></span>\nThis session will highlight how Splunk uses Jenkins to provide an end-to-end\nsolution in the development CI system.
