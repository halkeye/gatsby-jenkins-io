It will be one big party for\neverything Jenkins, from users to developers, from the community to vendors.\nThere will be more of what people always loved in past user conferences, such\nas technical sessions from users and developers, the Ask the Experts booth and\nplugin development workshop, and even more has been added, such as Jenkins\ntraining pre-conference, workshops and the opportunity to get certified for\nfree. Jenkins World is a not-to-be-missed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For me, the best part of Jenkins World is the opportunity to meet other Jenkins\nusers and developers face-to-face. We all interact on IRC, Google Groups or\nGitHub, but when you have a chance to meet in person, the person behind the\nGitHub ID or IRC name, whose plugin you use every day, becomes a real person.\nYour motivation might be a little different from mine, but we have the breath\nin the agenda to cover everyone from new users to senior plugin developers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This year, you’ll have more opportunities than ever before to learn about\nJenkins and continuous delivery/DevOps practices, and explore what Jenkins has\nto offer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are travelling from somewhere, you might as well get a two-day Jenkins training course to be held onsite, starting Monday.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Tuesday, you can attend your choice of workshops, which gives you more hands-on time to go deeper, including:</p>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The DevOps Toolkit 2.0 Workshop</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Let’s Build a Jenkins Pipeline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preparing for Jenkins Certification</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intro to Plugin Development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CD and DevOps Maturity for Managers</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Wednesday, the formal conference kicks off. Throughout Wednesday and\nThursday, you can choose from sessions spread across five tracks and covering\na diverse range of topics like infrastructure as code, security, containers,\npipeline automation, best practices, scaling Jenkins and new community\ndevelopment initiatives.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At Jenkins World, you’ll be exposed to projects going on in the community such\nas <a href=\"/projects/blueocean\">Blue Ocean</a>, a new Jenkins UX project. You can\nlearn more about <a href=\"/2.0/\">Jenkins 2</a> - a major release for the project, and based on the\nhuge number of downloads we saw in the weeks following its introduction at the\nend of April, it was a big +1. At Jenkins World, you will be immersed in\nJenkins and community, and leave knowing that you are part of a meaningful open\nsource project that, with your involvement, can do anything!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This year there will only be one Jenkins World conference, so that everyone\ninvolved in Jenkins can get together in one place at one time and actually see\neach other. I understand that it might be a bit more difficult for Jenkins\nusers outside of the US to make it to Jenkins World, but hopefully we made the\nevent worth your visit. As the final push on the back, CloudBees has created a\nspecial <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/juc/international-program\">international program</a>\nfor those who are coming from outside the United States.  You&#8217;ll have\ntime to talk with all of the other Jenkins users who have made the journey from\nacross the globe, you’ll be able to attend exclusive networking events and\nmore.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I hope to see you September 13th through 15th in Santa Clara at\n<a href=\"https://jenkinsworld.com\">Jenkins World</a> in Santa Clara!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonitionblock caution\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"icon\">\n<i class=\"fa icon-caution\" title=\"Caution\"></i>\n</td>\n<td class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Register for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home\">Jenkins World</a> in\nSeptember with the code <code>JWFOSS</code> for a 20% discount off your pass.</p>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>","id":"61a711c9-9de6-5990-b29e-67f3bac971b1","title":"Join me for Jenkins World 2016","date":"2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/07/26/join-me-at-jenkinsworld/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2016/08/03/st-petersburg-jam-3-4-report/","previous":"/blog/2016/07/19/blue-ocean-update/","id":"61a711c9-9de6-5990-b29e-67f3bac971b1"}},
