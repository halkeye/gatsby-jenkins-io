Many of the features we have been working on have\ncome a long way in the past few months but here&#8217;s a few highlights:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"goodbye-page-refreshes-hello-real-time-updates\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#goodbye-page-refreshes-hello-real-time-updates\"></a>Goodbye page refreshes, Hello Real Time updates!</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Building upon\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomfennelly\">Tom</a>'s great work on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/sse-gateway-plugin\">Server Sent Events</a> (SSE) both\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cliffmeyers\">Cliff</a> and\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomfennelly\">Tom</a> worked\non making the all the screens in Blue Ocean update without manual\nrefreshes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events\">SSE is a great technology</a>\nchoice for new web apps as it only pushes out\nevents to the client when things have changed on the server. That means\nthere’s a lot less traffic going between your browser and the Jenkins\nserver when compared to the continuous AJAX polling method that has been\ntypical of Jenkins in the past.</p>\n</div>\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AEnByFwPYaE?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\"\nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"new-test-reporting-ui\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#new-test-reporting-ui\"></a>New Test Reporting UI</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kzantow\">Keith</a> has\nbeen working with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vivekpandey\">Vivek</a> to\ndrive out a new set of extension points that allow us to build a new\nrest reporting UI in Blue Ocean. Today this works for JUnit test reports\nbut can be easily extended to work with other kinds of reports.</p>\n</div>\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QEeSOBCYY4o?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\"\nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"pipeline-logs-are-split-into-steps-and-update-live\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#pipeline-logs-are-split-into-steps-and-update-live\"></a>Pipeline logs are split into steps and update live</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThorScherler\">Thorsten</a> and\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophistifunk\">Josh</a> have\nbeen hard at work breaking down the log into steps and making the live\nlog tailing follow the pipeline execution - which we’ve lovingly\nnicknamed the “karaoke mode”</p>\n</div>\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ew13TjclNME?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\"\nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"pipelines-can-be-triggered-from-the-ui\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#pipelines-can-be-triggered-from-the-ui\"></a>Pipelines can be triggered from the UI</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomfennelly\">Tom</a> has\nbeen on allowing users to trigger jobs from Blue Ocean, which is one\nless reason to go back to the Classic UI :)</p>\n</div>\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kdT02vPTxQI?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\"\nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"blue-ocean-has-been-released-to-the-experimental-update-center\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#blue-ocean-has-been-released-to-the-experimental-update-center\"></a>Blue Ocean has been released to the experimental update center</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Many of you have asked us questions about how you can try Blue Ocean\ntoday and have resorted to building the plugin yourself or running our\nDocker image.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We wanted to make the process of trying Blue Ocean in its unfinished\nstate by publishing the plugin to the experimental update center - it&#8217;s\navailable today!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So what is the Experimental Update Center? It is a mechanism for the\nJenkins developer community to share early previews of new plugins with\nthe broader user community. Plugins in this update center are\nexperimental and we strongly advise not running them on production or\nJenkins systems that you rely on for your work.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>That means any plugin in this update center could eat your Jenkins data,\ncause slowdowns, degrade security or have their behavior change at no\nnotice.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>You can learn how to\n<a href=\"/blog/2013/09/23/experimental-plugins-update-center/\">activate\nthe experimental update center on this post</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"ce2c6f83-1ed8-521b-a608-5f3680ad5166","title":"Blue Ocean July development update ","date":"2016-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/07/19/blue-ocean-update/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"i386","html":"","id":"i386","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"James Dumay","slug":"/blog/authors/i386","twitter":"i386"}]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2016/07/26/join-me-at-jenkinsworld/","previous":"/blog/2016/07/18/pipeline-notifications/","id":"ce2c6f83-1ed8-521b-a608-5f3680ad5166"}},
