It is possible that your team might\nhave recognized the benefits that Docker provides in building microservices and\nthe advantages the technology could bring to development, testing, integration\nand, ultimately, production. However, you must create a comprehensive build\npipeline before deploying any containers into a live environment. Integrating\ncontainers into a CD pipeline is far from easy. Along with the benefits Docker\nbrings, there are challenges both technically and process-related. This\npresentation attempts to outline the steps you need to take for a\nfully-automated Jenkins pipeline that continuously builds, tests and deploys\nmicroservices into a Docker Swarm cluster.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n&#8212; Viktor Farcic\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/no-you-shouldnt-do-lessons-using-pipeline\"><strong>No,\nYou Shouldn&#8217;t Do That!
