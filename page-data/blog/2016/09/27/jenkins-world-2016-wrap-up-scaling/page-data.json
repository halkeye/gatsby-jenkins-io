From a single Jenkins controller with one or two agents to a\nmultiple controller with thousands of agents, from a team of only a few people\nto a whole company with multiple disparate departments and organizations,\nyou&#8217;ll find space where Jenkins is used.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Like any software or organization,\nthere are common challenges for increasing scale with Jenkins and some common best practices, but\nthere are also some unique solutions.  A big conference like\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home\">Jenkins World</a> brings users\nfrom all scales together to see how people in other organizations at similar or\ngreater scale are solving similar problems.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Here&#8217;s a recap of the some of the sessions on scaling Jenkins,\nwith links to slides and videos shared by <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>:</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image right\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/scaling-jenkins-at-jenkinsworld/159px-National_Public_Radio_logo.svg.png\" alt=\"159px National Public Radio logo.svg\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/milespj\">Paul Miles</a> and\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jgrantd\">Grant Dickie</a> of\n<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/\">NPR</a> talked about\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsops-initiative-streamline-and-automate-jenkins\"><strong>JenkinsOps: An Initiative to Streamline and Automate Jenkins</strong></a>.\nThey shared ways their team has used Jenkins to automate many of the\nadministrative tasks related to managing feature code branches,\nhandling deployments, running tests, and properly configuring their environments.\nThey also showed code samples and talked about future challenges in their quest\nto achieve\n<a href=\"https://puppet.com/blog/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment-what-s-diff\">continuous deployment</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/sites/default/files/2016-jenkins-world-jenkinsops_at_npr_-_final.pdf\"><strong>Download Presentation</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/qrAf5fjDTXI\"><strong>Stream Presentation</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image left\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/scaling-jenkins-at-jenkinsworld/Riot_Games_logo.png\" alt=\"Riot Games logo\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxfields\">Maxfield F Stewart</a> of\n<a href=\"https://www.riotgames.com\">Riot Games</a> showed how they built an\nintegrated Docker solution using Jenkins in\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/thinking-inside-container-continuous-delivery-story\"><strong>Thinking Inside the Container: A Continuous Delivery Story</a></strong>\nHe showed how their system allows engineers around the company to\nsubmit Docker images as build environments.\nThis has let their containerized farm now create over 10,000 containers per week\nand handles nearly 1,000 jobs at a rate of about 100 jobs per hour.\nAnd they have done this using readily available, open\nsource Jenkins plugins.
