There, as with previous years, we&#8217;ll have a table in the expo hall with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/status/662718638135181313\">plenty of\nstickers</a> and <em>perhaps</em> some other forms of swag available for devotees to\ncollect.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The expo hall will be open January 23rd and January 24th, and a few Jenkins\ncontributors will be there to ask questions to, talk about CI/CD and hand out\nstickers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://github.com/rtyler\">I</a> have a presentation on\nSaturday, January 23rd titled\n\"<a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/continuous-delivery-infrastructure-jenkins\">Continuous\nDelivery of Infrastructure with Jenkins</a>\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<div class=\"title\">Talk abstract</div>\n<p>\"\"\nIn this talk we will review continuous delivery concepts and put them into\npractice by building a continuous delivery pipeline with Jenkins to test, stage\nand deploy to infrastructure code to production. Reducing the effort, error\nrate and time it takes to deploy a configuration to change to production means\nless time fighting fires and more time doing what you want.\n\"\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>During the talk I&#8217;ll be highlighting some of the positive, and negative,\npatterns used by the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra\">Jenkins\ninfrastructure</a> team to manage, test and deliver the Jenkins project&#8217;s own\ninfrastructure. Sort of a followup from my\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqLGKa4QwA\">2014 PuppetConf talk</a> about\nmigrating Jenkins infrastructure from controllerless\n<a href=\"https://puppetlabs.com\">Puppet</a> to a\n<a href=\"https://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/index.html\">Puppet Enterprise</a> oriented\ninstallation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you&#8217;re in the LA area, we hope to see you for <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x\">SCaLE 14X</a> in Pasadena!</p>\n</div>","id":"384f4bba-69ff-5581-81d1-4fe0ea905976","title":"Jenkins at SCaLE 14x","date":"2016-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/01/04/jenkins-at-scale14x/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2016/01/05/new-website/","previous":"/blog/2015/12/21/december-jam-world-tour-toulouse-france/","id":"384f4bba-69ff-5581-81d1-4fe0ea905976"}},
