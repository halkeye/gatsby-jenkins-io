We have\n<a href=\"/project/conduct\">adapted the covenant</a> to meet the unique needs of a multifaceted\nproject like Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The document itself is broken down into three sections, all of which I\nencourage you to read:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"/project/conduct#code-of-conduct\">code of conduct</a> itself</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/project/conduct#reporting\">Instructions on how to report problems</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/project/conduct#handling-of-violations\">An outline of how violations will be handled</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Similar to many other process and philisophical documents in the Jenkins\nproject, the document is not etched in stone and is therefore intended to be\nupdated.
