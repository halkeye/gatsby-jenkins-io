Between <a href=\"https://fosdem.org\">FOSDEM</a>\n<a href=\"https://socallinuxexpo.org\">Southern California Linux Expo</a>  (also known as\nSCaLE) we seem to hand out more stickers during the last week in January than\nany other week of the year.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This year&#8217;s SCaLE 14X conference finally outgrew the LAX Hilton in Los Angeles,\nwhere it had been hosted in years past, and moved over to the Pasadena\nConvention Center in Pasadena California. While the organizers of the\nconference expanded their scope, so did the Jenkins project!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In addition to our normal Jenkins stickers, we also had some special edition\nstickers with <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logo\">special\nlogos</a> to give away this year, namely:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Angry Jenkins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>General Jenkins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Superhero Jenkins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"Cute\" Jenkins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ninja Jenkins</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To accompany the stickers we also had both blue Jenkins and red \"Angry Jenkins\"\npins. Savvy Jenkins users might recognize \"Angry Jenkins\" from the Jenkins\nserver&#8217;s internal 500 page; fortunately however very few people that came by\nthe booth to say 'hello' were familiar with Angry Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"talking-points\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#talking-points\"></a>Talking Points</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Aside from talking about the cool stickers and pins, we spent the vast\nmajority of time talking about Jenkins to two groups of people:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p>those who never had actually used Jenkins, even if they had heard of it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>users who knew plenty about Jenkins but hadn&#8217;t actually heard about some of\nthe <a href=\"/content/jenkins-20-proposals\">Jenkins 2.0 Proposals</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Anecdotally, it seemed like most of the people that I talked to about \"Jenkins\n2.0\" were pretty excited about the <code>Jenkinsfile</code> idea and starting to define\ntheir <a href=\"/solutions/pipeline\">build processes and delivery pipelines as code</a>\nin their source repositories.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Perhaps more importantly though, we spoke with many users about where Jenkins\nis causing them pain or frustration. Speaking directly with users at events\nlike SCaLE or Jenkins Area Meetups is always fun, having a high-bandwidth\nconversation about what we can do better and/or offering solutions/workarounds\nto hopefully relieve some pain-points.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In one such case, a contributor approached me and complained that he had\nemailed the developers' mailing list and frustratingly never actually received\na response. Comically enough, neither of us were able to find the email he had\nsent the mailing list (whoops!) but because of the dynamic nature of booth-duty\nat SCaLE, we got him squared away with a repository to contribute a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-charm\">Jenkins Charm</a> for the Juju\nconfiguration management tool.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"jammin\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#jammin\"></a>Jammin'</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Among the booth-duty highlights was meeting a few folks who were interested on\nstarting a southern California Jenkins meetup. Over the days following the\nconference, and a brief discussion on the\n<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/jenkinsci-jam/a071f664-30ab-44eb-b65f-a6f19cfbfdf5%40googlegroups.com.\">jenkinsci-jam@\nmailing list</a>, and the\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/\">Los Angeles\nJenkins Area Meetup</a></strong> was born!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the meetup growing over the next couple months and\nhelping build a stronger local Jenkins community in Southern Califonia for the\nother 51 weeks a year that SCaLE isn&#8217;t happening.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://socallinuxexpo.org\">SCaLE</a> is one of my more favorite\nopen source conferences, the positive community in attendance, a kid-friendly\natmosphere (\"Game Night\" was a blast) and the broad spectrum of sessions\navailable make it a great way to spent the weekend in southern California.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We hope to see you there again next year!</p>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"9cf2e2c2-42c4-541c-a75c-dd611f27f560","title":"SCaLE 14x Conference Report","date":"2016-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/02/06/scale14x-conference-report/","authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
