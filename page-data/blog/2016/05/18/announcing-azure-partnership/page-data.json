The partnership comes\nat an important time, after the recent launch of <a href=\"/2.0/\">Jenkins 2.0</a>,\nJenkins users are more readily adopting <a href=\"/solutions/pipeline\">Pipeline as\nCode</a> and many other plugins at an increasing rate, elevating the importance of\nJenkins infrastructure to the overall success of the project. That strong and\ncontinued growth has brought new demands to our infrastructure&#8217;s design and\nimplementation, requiring the next step in its evolution. This partnership helps\nus grow with the rest of the project by unifying our existing infrastructure\nunder one comprehensive, modern and scalable platform.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In March we\n<a href=\"http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-meeting/2016/jenkins-meeting.2016-03-30-18.00.html\">discussed\nthe potential partnership</a> in our regularly scheduled\n<a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda\">project\nmeeting</a>,\nhighlighting some of the infrastructure challenges that we face:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Currently we have infrastructure in four different locations, with four\ndifferent infrastructure providers, each with their own APIs and tools for\nmanaging resources, each with varying capabilities and capacities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Project infrastructure is managed by a team of volunteers, operating\nmore than 15 different services and managing a number of additional external\nservices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our current download/mirror network, while geographically distributed, is\nrelatively primitive and its implementation prevents us from using more modern\ndistribution best practices.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In essence, five years of tremendous growth for Jenkins has outpaced our\norganically grown, unnecessarily complex, project infrastructure. Migrating to\nAzure simplifies and improves our infrastructure in a dramatic way that would\nnot be possible without a comprehensive platform consisting of: compute, CDN,\nstorage and data-store services. Our partnership covers, at minimum, the next\nthree years of the project&#8217;s infrastructure needs, giving us a great home for\nthe future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Azure also enables a couple of projects that <a href=\"https://github.com/rtyler\">I</a>\nhave long been dreaming of providing to Jenkins users and contributors:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>End-to-end TLS encrypted distribution of Jenkins packages, plugins and\nmetadata via the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cdn/\">Azure CDN</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More complete build/test/release support and capacity on\n<a href=\"https://ci.jenkins.io\">ci.jenkins.io</a> for plugin developers using\n<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/\">Azure\nContainer Service</a> and generic VMs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins infrastructure is <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra\">all open\nsource</a> which means  all of our Docker containers, Puppet code and many of our\ntools are all available <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra\">on GitHub</a>. Not\nonly can you watch the migration process to Azure as it happens, but I also\ninvite you to <strong>participate</strong> in making our project&#8217;s infrastructure better (join\nus in the <code>#jenkins-infra</code> channel on <a href=\"https://freenode.net\">Freenode</a> or our\n<a href=\"http://lists.jenkins-ci.org/mailman/listinfo/jenkins-infra\">mailing list</a>).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Suffice it to say, I&#8217;m very excited about the bright [blue] future for the\nJenkins project and the infrastructure that powers it!</p>\n</div>","id":"3098cab4-cd65-52ec-a4a9-2b36e2ac20d7","title":"Partnering with Microsoft to run Jenkins infrastructure on Azure","date":"2016-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/05/18/announcing-azure-partnership/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[]}},"pageContext":{"next":"/blog/2016/05/23/external-workspace-manager-plugin/","previous":"/blog/2016/05/17/state-of-jam/","id":"3098cab4-cd65-52ec-a4a9-2b36e2ac20d7"}},
