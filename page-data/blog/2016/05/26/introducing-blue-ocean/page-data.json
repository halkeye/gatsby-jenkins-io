This shift represents a higher standard of design and user\nexperience that Jenkins needs to rise to meet.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We are excited to share and invite the community to join us on a project we’ve\nbeen thinking about over the last few months called Blue Ocean.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Blue Ocean is a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modelling\nand presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information that&#8217;s\nimportant to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still\nstaying true to the extensibility that is core to Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean/pipeline-run.png\" alt=\"Pipeline execution\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>While this project is in the alpha stage of development, the intent is that\nJenkins users can install Blue Ocean side-by-side with the Jenkins Classic UI\nvia a plugin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Not all the features listed on this blog are complete but we will be hard at\nwork over the next few months preparing Blue Ocean for general use. We intend\nto provide regular updates on this blog as progress is made.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Blue Ocean is <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudbees/blueocean\">open source today</a>\nand we invite you to give us feedback and to contribute to the project.</p>\n</div>\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3dITffteCD4?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\"\nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Blue Ocean will provide development teams:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"new-modern-user-experience\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#new-modern-user-experience\"></a>New modern user experience</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The UI aims to improve clarity, reduce clutter and navigational depth to make\nthe user experience very concise. A modern visual design gives developers much\nneeded relief throughout their daily usage and screens respond instantly to\nchanges on the server making manual page refreshes a thing of the past.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean/pipeline-dashboard.png\" alt=\"Project dashboard\"></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"advanced-pipeline-visualisations-with-built-in-failure-diagnosis\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#advanced-pipeline-visualisations-with-built-in-failure-diagnosis\"></a>Advanced Pipeline visualisations with built-in failure diagnosis</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"/solutions/pipeline\">Pipelines</a> are visualised on screen along with the\nsteps and logs to allow simplified comprehension of the continuous delivery\npipeline – from the simple to the most sophisticated scenarios.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Scrolling through 10,000 line log files is a thing of the past. Blue Ocean\nbreaks down your log per step and calls out where your build failed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean/failing-pipeline.png\" alt=\"Failing Pipeline\"></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"branch-and-pull-request-awareness\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#branch-and-pull-request-awareness\"></a>Branch and Pull Request awareness</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Modern pipelines make use of multiple Git branches, and Blue Ocean is designed\nwith this in mind. Drop a <a href=\"/doc/pipeline\"><code>Jenkinsfile</code> into your Git\nrepository</a> that defines your pipeline and Jenkins will automatically discover\nand start automating any  Branches and validating Pull Requests.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins will report the status of your pipeline right inside Github or\nBitbucket on all your commits, branches or pull requests.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean/pr-view.png\" alt=\"Pull request view\"></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"personalised-view\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#personalised-view\"></a>Personalised View</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Favourite any pipelines, branches or pull requests and see them appear on your\npersonalised dashboard. Intelligence is being built into the dashboard. Jobs\nthat need your attention, say a Pipeline waiting for approval or a failing job\nthat you have recently changed, appear on the top of the dashboard.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/blueocean/personalized-dashboard.png\" alt=\"Personalized dashboard\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>You can read more about Blue Ocean and its goals on the\n<a href=\"/projects/blueocean\">project page</a> and developers should watch the\n<a href=\"/content/mailing-lists\">Developers list</a> for more information.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For Jenkins developers and plugin authors:</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"jenkins-design-language\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#jenkins-design-language\"></a>Jenkins Design “Language”</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins Design Language (JDL) is a set of standardised React components and\na style guide that help developers create plugins that retain the look and feel\nof Blue Ocean in an effortless way. We will be publishing more on the JDL,\nincluding the style guide and developer documentation, over the next few weeks.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"modern-javascript-toolchain\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#modern-javascript-toolchain\"></a>Modern JavaScript toolchain</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins plugin tool chain has been extended so that developers can use\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/5-javascript-bad-parts-that-are-fixed-in-es6-c7c45d44fd81\">ES6</a>,\n<a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">NPM</a>\nin their plugins without endless yak-shaving. Jenkins\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/js-modules\">js-modules</a> are already in use in\nJenkins today, and this builds on this, using the same tooling.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"client-side-extension-points\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#client-side-extension-points\"></a>Client side Extension points</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Client Side plugins use Jenkins plugin infrastructure. The Blue Ocean libraries\nbuilt on ES6 and React.js provide an extensible client side component model\nthat looks familiar to developers who have built Jenkins plugins before. Client\nside extension points can help isolate failure, so one bad plugin doesn’t take\na whole page down.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"server-sent-events\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#server-sent-events\"></a>Server Sent Events</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events\">Server Sent Events</a>\n(SSE) allow plugin developers to tap into changes of state on the server and make\ntheir UI update in real time (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EttzK5OOpv0\">watch this for a\ndemo</a>).</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To make Blue Ocean a success, we&#8217;re asking for help and support from Jenkins\ndevelopers and plugin authors.
