Azure is Microsoft&#8217;s\npublic cloud offering and one of the many tools available to Jenkins users for\nadding elastic compute capacity, among other things, to their build/test/deploy\ninfrastructure. While our presentations are applicable to practically\nany cloud-based Jenkins environment, Thiago Almeida and Oguz Pastirmaci from\nMicrosoft were also on-hand and presented some interesting Azure-specific\nofferings like\n<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/\">Azure\nContainer Service</a> with Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>While we do not have video from the meetup, Brian and I did record\n<a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/TECHPOSITORY/Scaling-Jenkins-on-Azure\">a\nsession</a> with Thiago and Oguz for <a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com\">Channel9</a>\nwhich covers much of the same content:</p>\n</div>\n<center>\n  <iframe src=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/TECHPOSITORY/Scaling-Jenkins-on-Azure/player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowFullScreen frameBorder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</center>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To kick-off the meetup we asked attendees a few polling questions and\nreceived very telling responses:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How big is your Development/IT organization?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is your role?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By show of hands do you practice CI/CD/DevOps/etc?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At what scale (tooling and practice)?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The responses indicated that the majority of attendees were from small to medium\norganizations where they practiced Continuous Delivery across multiple teams. A\nnotable 25% or greater attendees considered themselves \"fullstack\" or\nparticipating in all of the roles of Developer, QA, and Operations. Interesting\nwhen paired with the high number (~80%) of those who practice CD.  This is\nlikely because modern teams, with mature CD practices, tend to blur the\ntraditional lines of Developer, QA and Operations. However, In my experience,\nwhile this is often the case for small to medium companies in large\norganizations team members tend to fall into the traditional roles, with CD\nproviding the practice and platform to unify teams across roles.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n&#8212; Brian Dawson\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After gauging the audience, Thiago and Brian reviewed Continuous Delivery (CD)\nand implementing it at scale. They highlighted the fact that CD is being rapidly\nadopted across teams and organizations, providing the ability: to deliver a demonstrably\nhigher quality product, shipping more rapidly than before, and to keep team members happier.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However, when organizations fail to properly support CD as they scale, they run\ninto issues such as: developers acting as administrators at the cost of\nproductivity, potential lack of security and/or exposure of IP and difficulty in\nsharing best practices across teams.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Thiago then highlighted that properly scaling CD practices in the organization\nalong with the infrastructure itself can alleviate these issues, and discussed\nthe benefits of scaling CD to on cloud platforms to provide \"CD-as-a-Service.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Overall I found the \"theory\" discussion to be on point, continuous delivery is\nnot just a technology nor a people problem. Successful organizations scale their\nprocesses and tooling <em>together</em>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The slides from our respective presentations are linked below:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>(Brian) <a href=\"/files/sf-jam-azure/Scaling%20Jenkins%20for%20CD%20with%20Azure.pdf\">Scaling Jenkins for Continuous Delivery</a> (.pdf)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Tyler) <a href=\"/files/sf-jam-azure/Scaling%20Jenkins%20with%20Azure.pdf\">Scaling Jenkins with Azure</a> (.pdf)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I hope you join us at future\n<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/\"><strong>San Francisco\nJAM</strong></a>s!</p>\n</div>","id":"16aeac16-1357-5d74-85da-84ef71ddbaa2","title":"SF JAM Report: Scaling Jenkins for Continuous Delivery with Azure","date":"2016-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/05/12/sf-jam-jenkins-and-azure/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
