From very simple and light certifications\nto very heavy and complex ones. In the \"light\" category you can usually be\ncertified on the basis of a short quiz at the end of an online training. At the\nother end of the spectrum, certifications are based on a proctored\nmultiple-choice questionnaire-based exam and/or hands-on labs. In some\nindustries, certifications are even more demanding. For instance, to become a\nCertified Public Accountant in the US, you have to pass a standard examination\nand, on top of this, each state/jurisdiction has its own set of education and\nexperience requirements that individuals must meet.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"creating-the-jenkins-certification\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#creating-the-jenkins-certification\"></a>Creating the Jenkins certification</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When we started our internal discussions at CloudBees regarding a certification\nprogram for Jenkins, we were aware of this broad set of certification\ndefinitions. Therefore, our first goal was to define what type of certification\nwe wanted to develop and for what purpose. We quickly agreed on the fact that it\nshould be <em>a professional-grade certification, whose purpose would be to provide\na professional standard for the Jenkins ecosystem,</em> benefiting both individuals\nand organizations, thanks to a common, respected and well-known body of\nknowledge and practice. \"Professional\" means that you have the expected level of\nskills and experience in order to leverage them in a professional environment,\nfor example in enterprise projects or as a consultant.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Many members of the CloudBees team have firsthand experience with certification\nprograms developed in other IT ecosystems such as telecoms (Cisco),\ninfrastructure (Microsoft, Red Hat) or business applications (SAP), to name a\nfew. This was definitely the type of professional certification we wanted to\nbring to Jenkins. We knew it would represent a substantial investment but we\nalso knew that the whole Jenkins ecosystem would benefit. Whether at the overall\ncommunity or individual level, as well as IT organizations, system integrators\nor recruiting firms looking for qualified Jenkins personnel.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I have had the privilege to supervise the creation and implementation of the\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-certification\">Jenkins Certification Program</a>\nat CloudBees. The program is comprised of two certifications: \"Certified Jenkins\nEngineer\" (CJE) for Jenkins certification, and Certified CloudBees Jenkins\nPlatform Engineer (CCJPE) for certification on the CloudBees Jenkins Platform.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We started by creating a Certification Advisory Board whose members are:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kohsuke\">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a>, Jenkins creator and CTO at\nCloudBees; <a href=\"https://github.com/harpreetsingh\">Harpreet Singh</a>, VP Products at\nCloudBees; <a href=\"https://github.com/olivergondza\">Oliver Gond≈æa</a>, initially\nrepresenting the Jenkins community; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsin\">Jason Shawn</a>,\nsenior director DevOps at Ellucian, representing the CloudBees customer\nconstituency; and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alvarezjj1\">Jose Alvarez</a>,\nmanaging director at Zivra, representing the CloudBees partner ecosystem.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This dedicated group helped us first to create the certification blueprint which\ndefines the main sections of the exam and their relative importance in the\noverall scoring. This blueprint also provides the high-level table of contents\nof the certification\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/sites/default/files/cje_study_guide_final.pdf\">study guides</a>.\nThey also helped to define the Jenkins Engineer profile that the certification\nassesses.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>With this blueprint in hand, we put together a team of 40 Jenkins subject-matter\nexperts (SMEs), mostly from CloudBees with a few from partners. Together they\nworked for several months on the creation of hundreds of exam questions, doing\niterative peer reviews, filtering out any irrelevant or ambiguous questions and\nnarrowing down the pool of questions to the best questions for each section.\nAll this, plus a thorough analysis and balancing exercise to make sure the level\nof difficulty was evenly distributed across each section of the exam.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The big lesson from the exam creation experience is that creating a\nprofessional-grade exam is hard! And it requires very specific experience. In\nshort, being a subject-matter expert is definitely not enough and we&#8217;re glad to\nhave collaborated with <a href=\"https://www.prometric.com/\">Prometric</a>'s\ncertification specialists who guided us through this process. The result is\ndefinitely worth the effort. Either of the two certifications offered within the\nJenkins Certification Program are truly what we would consider\n\"professional-grade certifications.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"what-does-certification-get-you\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-does-certification-get-you\"></a>What does certification get you?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Getting certified means being recognized for your skills and experience as a\nJenkins professional. However, like any exam-based recognition, its actual value\ndepends on three criteria: the level of difficulty of the exam, its quality and\nits integrity.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As far as <strong>difficulty</strong> is concerned, it is clear that not everyone will pass and\nthat is expected from a professional-grade certification, as mentioned earlier.\nWe have definitely created an exam that is demanding. It does not only measure\nyour theoretical knowledge of Jenkins but also your hands-on practical\nexperience. To ensure its <strong>quality</strong>, we have applied best-industry practices\nregarding the exam&#8217;s creation and review process, working with certification\nspecialists. It includes the weighing of questions, the distribution of easy,\nmedium and difficult ones, the removal of any ambiguous wording, as well as\nalpha and beta final test procedures, in order to only keep the most appropriate\nquestions. We are also putting in place a formal maintenance process to capture\nany \"bug\" in the exam and adapt the questions to Jenkins evolutions over time.\nLast but not least, we ensure the exam&#8217;s <strong>integrity</strong> by working with Prometric\nfor the administration of exams. Tests are taken in fully secured and proctored\ntest rooms, without any access to any human or electronic resource and\nwithout any doubt about who takes the test. Thanks to Prometric&#8217;s hundreds\nof test centers around the world, this integrity is ensured in any location.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Beyond this external recognition, getting certified is also a process that lets\nyou take a step back from your day-to-day practice of Jenkins and assess your\nskills and knowledge. You start this reassessment process by reading the Study\nGuides for the certifications. Then, by taking the test itself, you can identify\nyour strengths and weaknesses in a very practical way. In short, a certification\ngives you a measurable goal to achieve.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-certification\">here</a> for more\ninformation on the Jenkins Certification Program by CloudBees.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"e4799557-0475-5632-9141-cbf1a6b0bd10","title":"Introducing Jenkins Certification","date":"2016-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/2016/03/15/jenkins-certification/","links":{"discourse":""},"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"fdechery","html":"","id":"fdechery","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Francois Dechery","slug":"/blog/authors/fdechery","twitter":"francoisdechery"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e4799557-0475-5632-9141-cbf1a6b0bd10"}},
