Attendees learned the values of\nBlue Ocean, a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modeling\nand presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information that\nis important to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still\nstaying true to the extensibility that Jenkins always has had as a core value.\nThank you <a href=\"https://github.com/i386\">James Dumay</a> for stopping by to take part in\nthe inauguration.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/monthly-jam-nov-2016/melbourne.png\" alt=\"Melbourne JAM\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"singapore-singapore-jam\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#singapore-singapore-jam\"></a>Singapore, Singapore JAM</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>One of the members  who had several years of experience using Jenkins (since\nHudson days in fact) to present some basics on Continuous Integration with\nGitHub. It was targeted at new members who are starting out with Jenkins. We\nunderstand that we cannot always serve advanced topics to cater to the\nexperienced users and neglect the newbies so this session was targeted to help\ngive new users an introduction to Jenkins. It went well with about 15-20\nattendees and we hope to run some hands-on workshops in 2017. Some members were\nlooking forward to freebies like stickers and T-shirts too!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/monthly-jam-nov-2016/singapore-prep.png\" alt=\"Singapore JAM prep\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/monthly-jam-nov-2016/singapore-jam.png\" alt=\"Singapore JAM\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"moscow-russia-jam\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#moscow-russia-jam\"></a>Moscow, Russia JAM</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Moscow JAM leaders,\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tolkv\">Kirill Tolkachev</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://github.com/oleg-nenashev\">Oleg Nenashev</a>\nled the inaugural meeting with\na packed full agenda. Oleg began the meeting with an update on Jenkins 2 what improvements users can expect and what\nenhancements are in the works within the Jenkins project. Following Oleg, Kirill shared\nhow his team in Alfa Laboratory used Jenkins to improve CD/DevOps in their\nprojects (with Jenkins Pipeline, Job DSL and\n<a href=\"/projects/blueocean\">Blue Ocean</a>\n), the problems they experienced and how they fixed them. Then Oleg talked\nabout Jenkins Pipeline internals, main features and recent changes in the\necosystem.

All this may be due to Fannie Mae’s story\n- the success of how they used Jenkins for CI/CD as part of their DevOps\nadoption.
