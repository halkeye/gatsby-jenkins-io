href=\"/blog/2020/11/10/major-changes-in-weekly-releases/\">Major changes in the weekly release line</a> blog post, this release improves key user interface components. Configuration user interfaces now use html <code>div</code> markup to present a better layout than the previous html <code>table</code> layout. Configuration pages are now easier to read, easier to understand, and work better on a wide range of screens. See the <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=20741\">Jenkins issue tracker</a> for a list of plugins known to have issues with the change. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As described in the <a href=\"/blog/2020/11/10/spring-xstream/\">Spring and XStream updates (breaking changes!)</a> blog post, this release updates and replaces outdated internal components. The Acegi security library used for authentication has been replaced by Spring Security (<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/227/README.adoc\">JEP-227</a>). See the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/227/compatibility.adoc\">Spring Security compatibility table</a> for the latest plugin compatibility status. A fork of the XStream library used to read and write XML files has been replaced by the upstream version of XStream (<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/228/README.adoc\">JEP-228</a>). See the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/228/compatibility.adoc\">XStream compatibility table</a> for the latest plugin compatibility status. <p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Known Issues</b>If your Jenkins instance was created before Jenkins 2.4 or 2.7.1 LTS, a Setup Wizard may appear on the startup after the upgrade. In such a case, a Jenkins admin may need to skip the plugin installation.
