years ago, the Jenkins ruby-runtime was first released. It was an experiment to let\nplugins be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main\nJava Virtual Machine runtime with help of JRuby.\nA similar extension was made to allow plugins to be written in Python but still integrated into the Java Virtual Machine with Jython.\n\nOver the years though, the experiments are no longer being maintained and the\nplugins that use the non-Java runtimes take a lot of compatibility effort.\nIn addition, the Jenkins ruby runtime does not support Java 11.\nSpecifically, the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins\ncore developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and\nprocesses to keep the non-Java runtimes barely working.\nExamples of the experienced issues include compatibility with jep:200[Switch Remoting/XStream blocklist to a permitlist] where we had to allow many Ruby Runtime classes in the Jenkins core to support serialization of data.\n\nIn 2018 we discussed the future of the Ruby Runtime based plugins.\nThere was a consensus that we want to deprecate and remove the plugins so that Jenkins users do not experience issues .\nDaniel Beck created jep:7[Deprecation of ruby-runtime] for that.\nOver the years, the functionality provided by Ruby plugins has been largely replaced by other implementations,\nand hence we have decided to proceed with the deprecation\n( discussion).\n\nOne month from now, January 22nd, 2022, the default Jenkins update center will stop distributing\nthe Ruby runtime plugin, the plugins that use the Ruby runtime, the Python runtime plugin, and the plugin that uses the Python runtime.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nIf you are one of the few users who are using the following plugins, there will be no impact on your existing instances. The\nonly change will come for new installs. Suspended plugins will stay\ninstalled, but can not be newly installed without manually downloading\nreleases or using custom update centers.\n\nJenkins plugin management tools and distributions may be affected as well if they use the default update center to download the plugins and/or their metadata.\nIt includes but is not limited to the official Docker images,\nHelm charts,\nJenkinsfile Runner,\nCustom Jenkins WAR Packager,\nand the Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool.\nNote that all these tools allow custom update sites to be configured if required.\n\nThe lists below provide additional information about the plugins based on the Ruby Runtime and the Python Runtime.\nPlease plan your transition away from these plugins.\nThey will be removed from the official Jenkins update centers on January 22, 2022.\n\nAffected plugins\n\nGitlab Hook\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nContains multiple security vulnerabilties.\nSuggestion: Use the GitLab plugin and the GitLab Branch Source plugin.\n\nCucumber\n\nLast released 9 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run cucumber from the command line.\n\npyenv\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run pyenv from the command line.\n\nRvm\n\nLast released 5 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run rvm from the command line.\n\nCapitomcat\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Install Ruby and Capistrano and use sh or bat to invoke them from the command line.\n\nCommit Message Trigger\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh, bat, or other scripts to read git commit messages and conditionally execute Pipeline steps.\n\nGit notes\n\nLast released 10 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh, bat, or other scripts to run git to annotate commits.\n\nrbenv\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run rbenv from the command line.\n\nChef\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run chef from the command line.\n\nCI Skip\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the GitHub Commit Skip SCM Behaviour, Bitbucket Commit Skip SCM Behaviour, or SCM Skip to skip builds based on the content of commit messages.\nAlternately, use sh, bat, or other scripts to read git commit messages and conditionally execute Pipeline steps.\n\nInstallShield\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh, bat, or other scripts to run InstallShield.\n\nMySQL Job Databases\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use Jenkins Job Database Manager Plugin for MySQL.\n\nPathignore\n\nLast released 10 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the path ignore features of various plugins or use sh, bat, or other scripts to read git commit messages and conditionally execute Pipeline steps.\n\nPerl\n\nLast released 9 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run perl from the command line.\n\npry\n\nLast released 10 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the Jenkins groovy console and its interface from the Jenkins command line interface.\n\nSingle Use Agent\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use cloud agents ( Fargate, Azure Container Instances, Docker, etc.) to allocate agents for a single use and then release them.\n\nTravis YML\n\nLast released 5 years ago.\nSuggestion: Rewrite the travis.yml file as a Jenkinsfile, a Jenkins Templating Engine file, a Pipeline as YAML, or a Jenkins Modular Pipeline Library.\n\nYammer\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the Yammer REST API to post messages.\n\nDevStack\n\nLast released 9 years ago.\n\nIkachan\n\nLast released 10 years ago.\n\nJenkinspider\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\n\nPerl Smoke Test\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\n\nbuddycloud\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank all contributors and maintainers who contributed to the Ruby Runtime based plugins and the Python Runtime based plugin.\nWe also thank those who participated in development of new plugins replacing the functionality.\nThese contributors helped millions of Jenkins users while the ecosystem was supported over the past 10 years\nand it is not taken for granted.\nNow we need to move on so that we can keep expanding the Jenkins architecture and developers tools.\nWe invite all contributors to participate in this effort and to help us to migrate the plugins to supported JVM-based platforms for plugins.\n\nMy instance is affected, what to do next?\n\nIf you do not use the affected plugins, the recommendation is to remove them.\nOtherwise, it is recommended to start migration out of the plugins to alternatives providing similar functionality.\n\nNot all plugins have alternatives.\nAt the moment the Jenkins core team does not plan to provide a replacement, but any contributions are welcome.\nIf you depend on the functionality,\nwe recommend reaching out to the community in the developer mailing list so that\nyou can coordinate the replacement with other affected users.","title":"Deprecating non-Java

confirmed that Log4j is not used in Jenkins core.\nJenkins plugins may be using Log4j.\nYou can identify whether Log4j is included with any plugin by running the following Groovy script in the Script Console :\n\norg.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup.class.protectionDomain.codeSource\n\nIf this results in the following error, Log4j is not included in any installed and enabled plugin:\n\ngroovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: org for class: Script1\n\nOtherwise, the script output will print one location where Log4j is found, which includes the plugin name

mitigation status are listed in the Jenkins issue tracker.\nSee this Jira Epic for components known to be affected.\n\nLog4j in web application containers\n\nIf you are hosting your Jenkins in a separate web application container like Tomcat, Websphere, or Glassfish, check with the providers of those containers to assess if they are using a vulnerable version of Log4j.\n\nWhen Jenkins runs from the Docker image, a native installer package (deb, rpm, msi), or is invoked with java -jar jenkins.war, it is not running inside a separate web application container.\nIt is using the built-in Jetty web application container that is bundled inside Jenkins and does not include Log4j.\n\nLog4j in Jenkins project infrastructure\n\nThe Jenkins infrastructure team is currently checking all Jenkins project infrastructure for the presence of vulnerable versions of the Log4j library.\nThis work is ongoing.\nWe may decide to disable some services temporarily out of an abundance of caution.\nYou can see the status of services on the status page.","title":"Apache Log4j 2 vulnerability

continuous integration environment is a mixed bag of machines, platforms, build toolchains and operating systems.\nIdeally, you want as much flexibility as possible in managing these environments.\nYou want your build machines to be interchangeable and you don’t want to tie your builds to a particular machine.\nUsing containers as build agents is an effective way to get the flexibility you need to create applications faster and more effectively.\n\nMost modern software organizations recognize the benefits of deploying and managing applications as containers.\nAnd now more organizations are using containers to unify their build and test environments across machines, and to provide an efficient mechanism for deploying applications.\n\nIf you’re new to containers, think of it as the next step beyond virtualization.\nIt consists of a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.\nA container image contains everything it needs to run independently of the server on which it lives: It contains a copy of the operating system, along with your application.\nThat could include a database, code, configuration files, dependencies, and so forth.\n\nContainerization is a great way to simplify migration of Jenkins instances to different machines, as well as simplify ongoing maintenance and upgrades.\nStarting with versions 2.5 and higher, Jenkins Pipeline has built-in support for interacting with Docker from within a Jenkinsfile.\n\nAlthough you can install and upgrade Jenkins using OS-installable packages, the container images of Jenkins take installation and upgrades to a new level, removing a lot of the complications with maintaining the Jenkins installation.\nThat’s one of the main reasons you should prefer the container images of Jenkins over OS-specific installation packages.\n\nUsing containers as build agents for greater Pipeline flexibility\n\nWhat about using containers in your build agents? You’ll recall that Jenkins agents are the \"workers\" that perform operations requested by the Jenkins controller.\n\nWhat is a Jenkins agent?\n\nMany of you have been writing Jenkins pipelines for awhile, but you’ve been constrained by the tooling that’s available on your agent.\nBut what if you no longer had to be constrained by specific versions of specific tools on specific agents? And that you had full control over the tooling that you’re using just by having Docker available on your agents?\n\nWell, that is exactly what’s possible by using containers as build agents for Jenkins.\nTo learn how to set up your agents with Docker, watch this step-by-step video.\n\nHow to Setup Docker Containers As Build Agents for Jenkins\n\nSo why would you want to use a container as your build agent? As a pipeline author, it gives you the ability to define the tools and the specific versions of those tools that you want to use in your pipeline so that those items are not being mandated or managed by others.\n\nSecondly, if in your environment, someone else has to install the tools for you on your agent, you can completely bypass all of that because you’re able to dynamically bring in the tools that you want or need at runtime.\n\nFinally, it gives you the chance to experiment with different tools without having to make a long-term commitment to those tools.\nBecause if you have a dependency on someone else installing tools for you, that might take a long time.\nBut by running it as a container, you can test it out, and if it works, great! Then you have the option to work with somebody else to get static versions of those tools installed on your agents, or you can just stay with your container-based build agents.\n\nThanks to our

year, the Duchess community embraced a new challenge:\nworking on women’s presence in Open Source while participating in Jenkins during the Hacktoberfest, a yearly event.\n\nHuge congrats to all the contributors! 🥳\n\nNote: This blog is a translation, the source blog post is located here https://www.duchess-france.org/duchess-hacktoberfest-2021/\n\nAnne-Laure Gaillard Interview\n\nHello Anne-Laure, can you introduce yourself?\n\nLinkedIn\n\nAfter a PhD in Computer Science and a few years in Software Development, I specialized in software quality assurance, and particularly in the testing domain.\nI’m a supporter of the doctrine: “Quality is everyone’s business”. Fond of agility, I’m part of the organization committee of the Agile Tour Bordeaux since 2020.\n\nI also like to engage in sporting challenges: I swam across the Garonne (a big river in the south of France) and finished 2 triathlons.\nKeeping the best for the end: I’m the mother of two kids who taught me it’s possible to speak about Pokemon with one, while drawing a unicorn with the other.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nDuring my studies, I met quite a lot of “nerds / geeks” contributing to Linux distributions (Gentoo & Debian).\nTheir technical skills seemed higher than mine and the Open Source universe looked inaccessible to me.\nConcerning Jenkins, I am a user (now contributor) of it, but not an administrator.\n\nWhat motivated you to participate in that hackathon?\n\nI dared to participate thanks to the Duchess (and mainly Angélique, thanks to her).\nHaving the support and backing of the community was my motivation.\n\nWhat will you remember from this experience?\n\nFrom a professional point of view, I perfected my knowledge of Git, and I had a chance to overview part of the quality processes from Open Source projects.\nMy first Pull Request was approved by… 9 people!\nThe fourth reviewer did find an issue.\nWho can tell me code review isn’t useful now?\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I remember two things.\nThe first one: Open Source communities are not elitist communities.\nEvery contribution matters, even small ones.\nThe people I met were positive and benevolent.\nThe second one could be illustrated by a quote from Grace Hopper: “If it’s a good idea, go ahead and do it. It’s much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.”.\n\nDo you have anything more to say?\n\nAfter Jenkins, I also submitted Pull Requests to others Open Source projects.\nThe problem: with such a diversity of Open Source projects, how to organize your time?\n\nAnne-Laure Gaillard contributions during hacktoberfest\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5779\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5785\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5804\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5806\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5807\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5808\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5822\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5823\n\nhttps://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/pull/25\n\nhttps://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/pull/23\n\nhttps://github.com/sarequl/Netflix-Helper/pull/6\n\nBertha Torres Interview\n\nTwitter: @tatoberres\n\nLinkedIn\n\nHello Bertha, can you introduce yourself?\n\nComing from a literature training and as a language teacher for more than 15 years, it’s while moving to a high mountain area that a need to explore other skills set in.\n\nThus, a self-taught training followed by a validated file for financing diploma training followed one another and confirmed to me that life is too short to waste it on what does not make sense to us.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nParticipating in Open Source appeared to me in that exploratory process like a learning opportunity…\nwhich I thought was inaccessible of course!

bundles Guava, a core Java library from Google.\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.320 (released on November 10, 2021), Jenkins has upgraded the Guava library from\n11.0.1 (released on January 9, 2012) to\n31.0.1 (released on September 27, 2021).\nPlugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nUse the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\n\nMotivation\n\nMany security-conscious organizations using, or planning to use, Jenkins run off-the-shelf security scanners to look for known vulnerabilities.\nThese commonly flag the obsolete Guava library as susceptible to a serialization-related vulnerability ( CVE-2018-10237) and recommend upgrading.\nWhile Jenkins uses JEP-200 to form an explicit list of allowed classes for deserialization,\nand the two Guava classes affected by CVE-2018-10237 are not and will never be added to the list,\nit is time-consuming for the security team to respond to purported security reports\nand for users to justify exemptions from policy to use Jenkins anyway.\n\nFurthermore, the decade-old version of Guava has long been a maintenance burden for Jenkins developers.\nIn a world where Dependabot offers upgrades to libraries released just hours before,\nit is unpleasant to be working with dependencies that are many years old.\n\nFor more information, see JEP-233.\n\nUpgrading\n\nThe vast majority of plugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nJenkins users need only upgrade plugins to compatible versions as documented in the \"Released As\" field in Jira.\nIt is critical to use the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\nFailure to upgrade plugins to compatible versions may result in ClassNotFoundException, NoClassDefFoundError, or other low-level Java errors.\n\nReporting issues\n\nIf you find a regression in a plugin, please file a bug report in Jira:\n\nOpen JEP-233 issues\n\nWhen reporting an issue, include the following information:\n\nUse the JEP-233 label.\n\nProvide the complete list of installed plugins as suggested in the bug reporting guidelines.\n\nProvide the complete stack trace, if relevant.\n\nProvide steps to reproduce the issue from scratch on a minimal Jenkins installation; the scenario should fail when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.320 or later and pass when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.319 or earlier.\n\nIf you maintain a Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nthen please check if there is a pull request awaiting merge or release.\nIf you use an unmaintained Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nconsider stepping up and adopting the plugin to release a compatible version.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe expect to see a bit of disruption from these changes\nbut hope that in the long run they will save time for core and plugin developers\nand lead to a more secure and stable tool.\nPlease reach out on the developers' list with any questions or suggestions.","title":"Guava library upgrade (breaking

project started the migration of plugin documentation to GitHub almost two years ago.\nHacktoberfest 2021 identified 40 candidate plugins to migrate their documentation to GitHub.\nDan Heath,\nDeepak Gupta,\nAvinash Upadhyaya K R,\nRajan Kumar Singh, and\nDheeraj Singh Jodha provided a total of 29 pull requests migrating plugin documentation to GitHub.\n\nSpecial thanks to the contributors and to the plugin maintainers that merged and released documentation migration pull requests.\nEight plugins have fully migrated their documentation to GitHub through Hacktoberfest contributions.\nAn additional thirteen plugins have merged the documentation change and will complete the migration with their next plugin release.\n\nThe plugin documentation migration was coordinated through a worksheet.\nA tutorial video describing the documentation migration process is also available.\n\nImplementing Content Security Policy\n\nWadeck Follonier provided a tutorial to prepare Jenkins for a broader implementation of Content Security Policy.\nSix contributors provided pull requests to Jenkins core to create separate JavaScript files from JavaScript that was previously implemented inside the Jenkins 'jelly' files.\nMoving JavaScript into separate files prepares Jenkins to implement Content Security Policy protections against JavaScript embedded in HTML.\n\nJenkins Architecture Diagrams\n\nAngélique Jard provided architectural diagrams showing a dataflow view of Jenkins and a high level view of Jenkins.\nThose diagrams help others understand the internal structure of Jenkins and how it interacts with users and with other systems.\n\nModernizing Plugins Video Series\n\nDarin Pope created five videos illustrating some of the small steps that a new contributor can use to help modernize a plugin.\nAdditional plugin modernization and adoption ideas are included in the\"Contributing to Open Source\" workshop from DevOps World 2021.\n\nModernizing Jenkins

common CI/CD use-cases a lot of the space is consumed by test reports.\nThis data is stored within JENKINS_HOME,\nand the current storage format requires huge overheads when retrieving statistics and, especially, trends.\nIn order to display trends, each report has to be loaded and then processed in-memory.\n\nThe main purpose of externalising Test Results is to optimize Jenkins performance and storage\nby querying the desired data from external storages.\n\nI’m please to announce that the JUnit Plugin external storage is now available for use.\n\nGetting started\n\nInstall your database vendor specific plugin, you can use the Jenkins plugin site to search for it:\n\nhttps://plugins.jenkins.io/ui/search/?labels=database\n\ne.g. you could install the PostgreSQL Database plugin.\n\nWe currently support PostgreSQL or MySQL, but can support others, just create an issue or send a pull request.\n\nFrom Jenkins UI\n\nNavigate to: Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Junit\n\nIn the dropdown select 'SQL Database'\n\nNow configure your Database connection details.\n\nSearch for 'Global Database' on the same 'Configure System' page.\n\nSelect the database implementation you want to use and click 'Test Connection' to verify Jenkins can connect\n\nClick 'Save'\n\nConfiguration as code\n\nIf you want to configure the plugin via Configuration as Code then see the below sample:\n\nunclassified:\n  globalDatabaseConfiguration:\n    database:\n      postgreSQL:\n        database: \"jenkins\"\n        hostname: \"${DB_HOST_NAME}\"\n        password: \"${DB_PASSWORD}\"\n        username: \"${DB_USERNAME}\"\n        validationQuery: \"SELECT 1\"\n  junitTestResultStorage:\n    storage: \"database\"\n\nUsing the plugin\n\nNow run some builds, here’s an example pipeline configuration to get you started if you’re just trying out the plugin:\n\nnode {\n  writeFile file: 'x.xml', text: '''\n\n'''\n  junit 'x.xml'\n}\n\nYou will see a test result trend appear like below on the builds project page:\n\nIf you check on the controller’s file system you will see no junitResult.xml for new builds.\n\nIf you connect to your database and run:\n\nSELECT * FROM caseresults;\n\nYou will see a number of test results in the database.\n\nWhat happens to existing test results?\n\nExisting test results will stay on disk but will not be loaded.\n\nCurrently there is no migration scripts or plugin functionality to do this, if you need it then please raise an issue.\n\nHow are test results cleaned up\n\nWhen a job or build is deleted the related test results are removed.\n\nThis is expected to be done as part of a 'Build Discarder'.\n\nIf you wish to keep your results longer than this you can disable this feature by enabling:\n\nSkip cleanup of test result on build deletion on the system configuration page.\n\nIf you need more complex cleanup strategies built into the plugin then please raise an issue.\n\nAPI\n\nThe API is defined at:\n\njenkinsdoc:junit:io.jenkins.plugins.junit.storage.JunitTestResultStorage[]\n\njenkinsdoc:junit:io.jenkins.plugins.junit.storage.JunitTestResultStorageDescriptor[]\n\njenkinsdoc:junit:io.jenkins.plugins.junit.storage.TestResultImpl[]\n\nJunitTestResultStorage#load is passed a job name and build which can be used to construct an instance of the external storage implementation.\n\nThis implementation will then act on that job and build except for the optimised calls that act across all builds.\n\nThe API contains the basic methods like getFailCount, getSkipCount, but also APIs that are optimised for retrieving data for the trend graphs on the job page and the test result history page.\n\nThese allow single API calls to be made for what used to be a lot of work for Jenkins to look up before.\n\nFeedback\n\nI would love to hear your feedback & suggestions for this feature.\n\nPlease create an issue at https://github.com/jenkinsci/junit-plugin or provide feedback on https://community.jenkins.io","title":"Introducing external storage for

Pipeline (or simply Pipeline with a capital P) is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.\nThis allows you to automate the process of getting software from version control through to your users and customers.\n\nPipeline code works beautifully for its intended role of automating build, test, deploy, and administration tasks.\nBut, as it is pressed into more complex roles and unexpected uses, some users have run into snags.\nUsing best practices – and avoiding common mistakes – can help you design a pipeline that is more robust, scalable, and high-performing.\n\nWe see a lot of users making basic mistakes that can sabotage their pipeline.\n(Yes, you can sabotage yourself when you’re creating a pipeline.)\nIn fact, it’s easy to spot someone who is going down this dangerous path – and it’s usually because they don’t understand some key technical concepts about Pipeline.\nThis invariably leads to scalability mistakes that you’ll pay dearly for down the line.\n\nDon’t make this mistake!\n\nPerhaps the biggest misstep people make is deciding that they need to write their entire pipeline in a programming language.\nAfter all, Pipeline is a domain specific language (DSL).\nHowever, that does not mean that it is a general-purpose programming language.\n\nIf you treat the DSL as a general-purpose programming language, you are making a serious architectural blunder by doing the wrong work in the wrong place.\nRemember that the core of Pipeline code runs on the controller.\nSo, you should be mindful that everything you express in the Pipeline domain specific language (DSL) will compete with every other Jenkins job running on the controller.\n\nFor example, it’s easy to include a lot of conditionals, flow control logic, and requests using scripted syntax in the pipeline job.\nExperience tells us this is not a good idea and can result in serious damage to pipeline performance.\nWe’ve actually seen organizations with poorly written Pipeline jobs bring a controller to its knees, while only running a few concurrent builds.\n\nWait a minute, you might ask, “Isn’t handling code what the controller is there for?”\nYes, the controller certainly is there to execute pipelines.\nBut, it’s much better to assign individual steps of the pipeline to command line calls that execute on an agent.\nSo, instead of running a lot of conditionals inside the pipeline DSL, it’s better to put those conditionals inside a shell script or batch file and call that script from the pipeline.\n\nHowever, this raises another question: “What if I don’t have any agents connected to my controller?”\nIf this is the case, then you’ve just made another bad mistake in scaling Jenkins pipelines.\nWhy? Because the first rule of building an effective pipeline is to make sure you use agents.\nIf you’re using a Jenkins controller and haven’t defined any agents, then your first step should be to define at least one agent and use that agent instead of executing on the controller.\n\nFor the sake of maintaining scalability in your pipeline, the general rule is to avoid processing any workload on your controller.\nIf you’re running Jenkins jobs on the controller, you are sacrificing controller performance.\nSo, try to avoid using Jenkins controller capacity for things that should be passed off to an agent.\nThen, as you grow and develop, all of your work should be running agents.\nThis is why we always recommend setting the number of executors on the master to zero.\n\nUse Just Enough Pipeline to Keep Your Pipeline Scalable\n\nAll of this serves to highlight our overarching theme of “using just enough pipeline.”\nSimply put, you want to use enough code to connect the pipeline steps and integrate tools – but no more than that.\nLimit the amount of complex logic embedded in the Pipeline itself (similarly to a shell script), and avoid treating it as a general-purpose programming language.\nThis makes the pipeline easier to maintain, protects against bugs, and reduces the load on controllers.\n\nAnother best practice for keeping your pipeline lean, fast, and scalable is to use declarative syntax instead of scripted syntax for your Pipeline.\nDeclarative naturally leads you away from the kinds of mistakes we’ve just described.\nIt is a simpler expression of code and an easier way to define your job.\nIt’s computed at the startup of the pipeline instead of executing continually during the pipeline.\n\nTherefore, when creating a pipeline, start with declarative, and keep it simple for as long as possible.\nAnytime a script block shows up inside of a declarative pipeline, you should extract that block and put it in a shared library step.\nThat keeps the declarative pipeline clean.\nBy combining declarative with a shared library, that will take care of the vast majority of use cases you’ll encounter.\n\nThat said, it’s not accurate to say that declarative plus a shared library will solve every problem.\nThere are cases where scripted is the right solution.\nHowever, declarative is a great starting point until you discover that you absolutely must use scripted.\n\nJust remember, at the end of the day, you’ll do well to follow the adage: “Use just enough pipeline and no more.”\n\nThanks to our Sponsor\n\nMark and Darin both work
