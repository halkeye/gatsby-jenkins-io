are many ways to set up your Jenkins environment, and depending on the configuration you choose, there are different best practices and options to optimize your environment.\nIn this blog, I‚Äôm going to focus on Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees as a way to fine-tune your environment.\nIt‚Äôs a free tool that can help administrators understand and manage their Jenkins controller.\nIf you‚Äôre a CloudBees customer, the tool automatically comes with CloudBees CI.\nHowever, it‚Äôs also available as a free open source tool to anyone who uses Jenkins.\nThe Jenkins Health Advisor tool can make your life easier, because it can arm you with the information you need to keep your Jenkins environment running smoothly.\n\nA Bit of Background\n\nThe CloudBees support team originally created the tool as a way to help customers troubleshoot Jenkins issues.\nWith the tool, our support engineers could gather information from a customer‚Äôs Jenkins controller about the configuration of the controller and agents, the operating system, stats from web requests, and the like.\nOur tech support teams used this data to help customers pinpoint problems, such as security vulnerabilities, performance problems, and plugin version issues.\nVery quickly, our support tooling team saw the bigger-picture benefits of the diagnostic tool as an opportunity for people to proactively manage their controller.\nWith that bit of background, let‚Äôs dive into the Jenkins Health Advisor tool so you understand how it can help you.\n\nThe Problem ‚Äî Lack of Visibility into Controller Environment\n\nBecause of the open-source nature of Jenkins and the vast array of plugins that you can deploy in your Jenkins installation, downstream code changes to plugins and corresponding dependencies can inadvertently impact your environment, which slows productivity, causes confusion, and impacts the quality of your software delivery.\nWhen problems arise, Jenkins administrators need to quickly pinpoint the root cause of an issue, and that can be quite a challenge.\n\nThe Solution ‚Äî Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees\n\nWhen an issue arises, you need razor sharp insight to help you quickly sift through lines upon lines of data about your Jenkins controller and your plugins to identify the problem.\nAnd, that‚Äôs exactly what Jenkins Health Advisor does.\nIt gives you specific information about potential problems in your environment so you can resolve issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen you first install the Jenkins Health Advisor tool in your environment, you‚Äôll receive a report that lists everything it detects in your system.\nYou‚Äôll then receive report emails only when something changes that could impact your environment or when the tool identifies an issue that could be problematic.\nIf there are no issues in your environment, you don‚Äôt receive an email.\nIt‚Äôs really that simple.\n\nThe Power is in the Insight ‚Ä¶ and the CloudBees Support\n\nOk, so let‚Äôs explain how Jenkins Health Advisor uses data to help you optimize your environment.\nThe tool actually generates a support bundle every 24 hours.\nWe don‚Äôt want to bog down your email inbox with redundant reports emails, so we don‚Äôt send every report to you‚Äîonly the reports that indicate an issue with your environment.\nHowever, CloudBees receives every support bundle from every user.\nWe are constantly monitoring all of this active Jenkins controller data with external Jenkins and open source data about known issues, plugin updates, security vulnerabilities, etc.\nIf the Jenkins Health Advisor tool identifies an issue that could impact your system, you‚Äôll receive an email so you can proactively address the problem.\nAt the same time, CloudBees engineering teams are continually working to enhance the detection capabilities of the Jenkins Health Advisor tool, so you can work as proactively as possible to manage your environment.\n\nThe emails you receive identify potential problems, and they also include supporting information to help you resolve issues, with links to solutions and recommended resolutions as well as articles to understand the problem.\n\nHelpful Tips to Gain Value from Jenkins Health Advisor\n\nImprove Troubleshooting\n\nIf you need to troubleshoot a particular issue, you can manually generate a support bundle to give you point-in-time information on your environment.\nYou can filter the support bundle data on different system parameters, like the build queue, dump agent export tables, and garbage collection logs, so you get the specific information you need.\n\nGenerate Anonymized System Data\n\nAt any time, you can change the settings on your tool to anonymize the data in your support bundles.\nYou may want to do this if you don‚Äôt want to share sensitive project data with CloudBees.\nOur support and engineering teams can still gain valuable insight from your generic system data.\nThis is also a helpful feature if you need to share system data with a partner or vendor, and you don‚Äôt want to share project or personnel data.\n\nJenkins Health Advisor Tool Updates and Support\n\nAs we mentioned above, the CloudBees support tooling team is constantly working to enhance the tool.\nTo ensure it‚Äôs always as current as possible, we release updates to the tool every two weeks.\nUsually these updates won‚Äôt impact your Jenkins environment.\nHowever, if there are changes to the tool that might affect your system, you‚Äôll receive a notification email so there are no surprises.\nAnd, if you need help with the Jenkins Health Advisor tool, our support engineers are available to answer your questions.\n\nStart Using Jenkins Health Advisor Today\n\nGiven the vast Jenkins community, it‚Äôs impossible to know everything that may impact your environment, even if you look at your control panel every day and scour open source forums on a regular basis to stay on top of new issues and vulnerabilities.\nThe Jenkins Health Advisor tool is designed to streamline the work effort of your daily routine by automatically telling you when there‚Äôs an issue that may impact your Jenkins environment.\nWith the proactive Jenkins Health Advisor notifications, you can spend your time on more strategic tasks.\n\nInstall the plugin and enroll your controller with

you‚Äôve been following JenkinsIsTheWay.io, you‚Äôve read some fantastic stories from the Jenkins user community about the great stuff they are building with Jenkins.\nWith over 200,000 installations to date, Jenkins remains the most widely used open-source automation server.\nAnd story after story, we hear what a critical role Jenkins plays in building robust, secure CI/CD pipelines.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that in many of the back (and remote) offices of Fortune 500 companies, developers are turning to Jenkins to help make their lives easier with automation while also giving their engineers more time to innovate.\nWith this in mind, I invite you to read the latest ebook focused on the behind-the-scenes development activities underway in large-scale enterprises.\n\nJenkins

all,\n\nTime flies and the Jenkins elections period is here.\n\nThis year, two board seats and all officer positions are up for election.\nThanks, Oleg Nenashev and Ullrich Hafner who led the Jenkins project as board members for the last two years.\nThanks, Tim Jacomb, Daniel Beck, Mark Waite for your dedication as officers over the past year.\n\nWe already had two successful editions in a row. I want us to continue on that path.\nThis is a tremendous opportunity for community members to influence the direction of the project for the next two years.\nTo make this year‚Äôs election even better, we slightly modified the process by leveraging our new community platform aka community.jenkins.io.\n\nTo participate in the election, we ask every Jenkins community member to have an account on community.jenkins.io.\nYou can either reuse your Github account or create a new discourse account specific to community.jenkins.io.\nThe second requirement is to be able to showcase at least one contribution done before the first of September 2021.\nAs mentioned on jenkins.io.io/participate, they are many different ways to contribute to Jenkins and for many of them, it‚Äôs very difficult to measure.\nTherefore we‚Äôll trust participants and will not require that they provide evidence of contribution as part of their voter registration. We reserve the right to ban the specific account from the election process if we identify abuse.\nThe election works in three stages:\n\nIdentify voters and nominees\n\nVoting period\n\nAnnounce results\n\nVoters\n\nTo invite participants to vote, we need a list of email‚Äôs addresses that we would share with the Condorcet Internet Voting Service.\nTherefore we ask every community member who matches the requirements to join the group election-voter on community.jenkins.io.\nThe group will be open for joining during the registration period after we‚Äôll close registration during the voting period.\nWe‚Äôll use emails from the ‚Äúelection-voter‚Äù group members.\n\nNominees\n\nDuring the same period, we invite every community member to nominate candidates by sending a message to the group election-committee mentioning the position and the motivation.\nOn the 31 of October, the nomination period will end. We‚Äôll notify all the nominees and get confirmation that they are interested in running as a candidate.\nThe list of candidates will be announced on the 7th of November.\n\nEverybody can nominate candidates.\n\nThis year we are looking for nominees for the following positions:\n\nBoard members\n\nDocumentation Officer\n\nEvents Officer\n\nInfrastructure Officer\n\nRelease Officer\n\nSecurity Officer\n\nMore information about the different roles can be found on jenkins.io/project/team-leads.\n\nElection\n\nOn the 7th of November, once voters and candidates are identified, we‚Äôll invite everybody by email to vote using civs.cs.cornell.edu.\nAt this stage of the election, nobody will be allowed to register.\nVoting deadline is the 30th of November.\n\nResult\n\nAs soon as we have the election results, we‚Äôll publish them.\nElected members will begin their official roles on the 3rd of December 2021.\n\nKey Dates\n\nSep 20: Nomination and voter registration begin\n\nOct 31: Nomination deadline\n\nNov 07: Candidates announced, Registration deadline, voting start\n\nNov 30: Voting deadline\n\nDec 03: Results announced\n\nKey Information:\n\nEverybody can suggest candidates by sending a private message to the group election-committee.\n\nVoters register for the election by joining the public group election-voter.\n\nEmail participants will be shared with Condorcet Voting System to send voting invitations.\n\nNobody can register for the election once we send invitations to Condorcet Voting System.\n\nOnce the election is over, every member of the group\"election-voter\" will get a badge on https://community.jenkins.io as a ‚Äú2021 Election Participant‚Äù.\n\nOnce the election is over, every nominee will get the badge ‚Äú2021 Election Nominee‚Äù.\n\nCheers,","title":"Jenkins Election

this week the Jenkins infrastructure team identified a successful attack against our deprecated Confluence service.\nWe responded immediately by taking the affected server offline while we investigated the potential impact.\nAt this time we have no reason to believe that any Jenkins releases, plugins, or source code have been affected.\n\nThus far in our investigation, we have learned that the Confluence CVE-2021-26084 exploit was used to install what we believe was a Monero miner in the container running the service.\nFrom there an attacker would not be able to access much of our other infrastructure.\nConfluence did integrate with our integrated identity system which also powers Jira, Artifactory, and numerous other services.\n\nThe trust and security in Jenkins core and plugin releases is our highest priority.\nWe do not have any indication that developer credentials were exfiltrated during the attack.\nAt the moment we cannot assert otherwise and are therefore assuming the worst.\nWe are taking actions to prevent releases at this time until we re-establish a chain of trust with our developer community.\nWe have reset passwords for all accounts in our integrated identity system.\nWe are improving the password reset system as part of this effort.\n\nAt this time, the Jenkins infrastructure team has permanently disabled the Confluence service, rotated privileged credentials, and taken proactive measures to further reduce the scope of access across our infrastructure.\nWe are working closely with our colleagues at the Linux Foundation and the Continuous Delivery Foundation to ensure that infrastructure which is not directly managed by the Jenkins project is also scrutinized.\n\nIn October 2019 we made the Confluence server read-only effectively deprecating it for day-to-day use within the project.\nAt that time, we began migrating documentation and changelogs from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\nThat migration has been ongoing, with hundreds of plugins and many other documentation pages moved from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\n\nWe are grateful for those of you who followed our responsible disclosure procedure and reached out to us about this vulnerability affecting the Jenkins project.\n\nWe will continue to take proactive measures to improve the security of our infrastructure and encourage you to follow us on Twitter for further updates.","title":"Jenkins project Confluence instance

Thus, Jetstack/cert-manager is used to provision TLS certificates and establish connection between Kubernetes API and webhook.\n\nImplementaion\n\nOperator-SDK takes care of creating a new webhook and appending it to the manager and creating handlers.\nTls certificates are managed using cert-manager.\n\nValidation Logic:\n\nProposed Implementations: Iterate through the list of plugins to be installed and fetch warnings for each plugin from the plugin center API and check if the version of that plugin has any of those warnings.\n\nCaveats: Webhooks add latency to an API request, hence they should evaluate as quickly as possible thus having max allowed timeout of 30s. In the earlier approach I was fetching the security warnings from the plugin site API in the validator interface itself, and since network operations are slow, it was causing a timeout in the case of validating a larger number of plugins or when the Internet connection was not good.\n\nUpdated Implementaion: Instead of fetching information for each plugin, the information about all the plugins is downloaded and cached at the start of the operator and updated periodically, thus eliminating network calls and finishing validation in less than a second.\n\nEvaluation Phase 1:\n\nScaffoled a new validation webhook\n\nAdded manifests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, certificates and volumes, and updated Makefile\n\nImplemented the validator interface\n\nUpdated helm charts\n\nEvaluation Phase 2:\n\nReimplemented the validator interface.\n\nAdded unit tests for internal functions\n\nAdded e2e tests along with helm tests\n\nUpdated helm charts\n\nResources\n\nPull Requests\n\nAdded validation webhook,manifests,and updated Makefile\n\nImplemented validation logic,added tests and updated helm charts\n\nPhase 1 demo\n\nUser Guide\n\nThe webhook feature is completely optional for the user. It can be easily deployed using Helm Chart by setting webhook.enabled in values.yaml and in the Operator command line flag.\n\nwebhook.enabled=true\n\nTo enable security validation in the jenkins custom resource set\n\njenkins.ValidateSecurityWarnings=true\n\nNote: The webhook takes some time to get up and running, also when helm renders the template, the validating webhook configuration is applied last, hence if the user wants to deploy the Jenkins Custom Resource with validation turned on, he needs to wait for some time. After the webhook is up and running the user can deploy the Jenkins Custom Resource using helm or kubectl\n\nFuture work\n\nImplementing a post-install hook in the helm charts that checks whether the webhook is up and running.\n\nAdding validation for required core version of plugin and core version of Jenkins.\n\nMigrating other validation logic from controller to the webhook.\n\nAdding validation for the dependencies of the plugins.","title":"Security Validator for Jenkins Operator for

Jenkins project provides Docker images for controllers, inbound agents, outbound agents, and more.\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.307 released August 17, 2021 and Jenkins 2.303.1 released August 25, 2021, the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project will use Java 11 instead of Java 8.\n\nControllers use Java 11 by default\n\nIf you are running one of the Jenkins Docker controller images that does not include a JDK version in its label, the Java runtime will switch from Java 8 to Java 11 with the upgrade.\n\nFor example:\n\nJenkins 2.306 running as jenkins/jenkins:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.307 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:latest, it will use Java 11\n\nJenkins 2.289.3 running as jenkins/jenkins:lts uses Java 8.\nWhen Jenkins 2.303.1 or later is run with jenkins/jenkins:lts, it will use Java 11\n\nThe Docker image tags affected by this upgrade include:\n\nalpine\n\ncentos7\n\nlatest\n\nlts\n\nslim\n\nUsers that need to remain with Java 8 may use a

next 1-2 weeks (Aug 17, 2021 - Aug 31, 2021), the Jenkins agent images will be updated to use Java 11 instead of Java 8.\n\nFor example:\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.9-1 uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.10-1 it will use Java 11.\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:latest uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:latest after the agent change, it will use Java 11.\n\nUsers that need to remain with Java 8 may use a different Docker image tag to run with Java 8.\n\nRunning a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.9-1 uses Java 8.\nWhen running a Jenkins agent from Docker image jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.10-1-jdk8 it will also use Java 8.\n\nDocker tag updates stopped\n\nThe Jenkins project will no longer update the Docker images that are based on CentOS 8.\nThe CentOS project has changed direction to track just ahead of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux release rather than tracking after a release.\nThey are no longer publishing updates for CentOS 8 Docker images.\n\nUsers running Jenkins 2.306 or earlier with the jenkins/jenkins:centos tag will need to switch to use a different tag.\nThey may consider
