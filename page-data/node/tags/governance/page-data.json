I want us to continue on that path.\nThis is a tremendous opportunity for community members to influence the direction of the project for the next two years.\nTo make this year’s election even better, we slightly modified the process by leveraging our new community platform aka community.jenkins.io.\n\nTo participate in the election, we ask every Jenkins community member to have an account on community.jenkins.io.\nYou can either reuse your Github account or create a new discourse account specific to community.jenkins.io.\nThe second requirement is to be able to showcase at least one contribution done before the first of September 2021.\nAs mentioned on jenkins.io.io/participate, they are many different ways to contribute to Jenkins and for many of them, it’s very difficult to measure.\nTherefore we’ll trust participants and will not require that they provide evidence of contribution as part of their voter registration. We reserve the right to ban the specific account from the election process if we identify abuse.\nThe election works in three stages:\n\nIdentify voters and nominees\n\nVoting period\n\nAnnounce results\n\nVoters\n\nTo invite participants to vote, we need a list of email’s addresses that we would share with the Condorcet Internet Voting Service.\nTherefore we ask every community member who matches the requirements to join the group election-voter on community.jenkins.io.\nThe group will be open for joining during the registration period after we’ll close registration during the voting period.\nWe’ll use emails from the “election-voter” group members.\n\nNominees\n\nDuring the same period, we invite every community member to nominate candidates by sending a message to the group election-committee mentioning the position and the motivation.\nOn the 31 of October, the nomination period will end. We’ll notify all the nominees and get confirmation that they are interested in running as a candidate.\nThe list of candidates will be announced on the 7th of November.\n\nEverybody can nominate candidates.\n\nThis year we are looking for nominees for the following positions:\n\nBoard members\n\nDocumentation Officer\n\nEvents Officer\n\nInfrastructure Officer\n\nRelease Officer\n\nSecurity Officer\n\nMore information about the different roles can be found on jenkins.io/project/team-leads.\n\nElection\n\nOn the 7th of November, once voters and candidates are identified, we’ll invite everybody by email to vote using civs.cs.cornell.edu.\nAt this stage of the election, nobody will be allowed to register.\nVoting deadline is the 30th of November.\n\nResult\n\nAs soon as we have the election results, we’ll publish them.\nElected members will begin their official roles on the 3rd of December 2021.\n\nKey Dates\n\nSep 20: Nomination and voter registration begin\n\nOct 31: Nomination deadline\n\nNov 07: Candidates announced, Registration deadline, voting start\n\nNov 30: Voting deadline\n\nDec 03: Results announced\n\nKey Information:\n\nEverybody can suggest candidates by sending a private message to the group election-committee.\n\nVoters register for the election by joining the public group election-voter.\n\nEmail participants will be shared with Condorcet Voting System to send voting invitations.\n\nNobody can register for the election once we send invitations to Condorcet Voting System.\n\nOnce the election is over, every member of the group\"election-voter\" will get a badge on https://community.jenkins.io as a “2021 Election Participant”.\n\nOnce the election is over, every nominee will get the badge “2021 Election Nominee”.\n\nCheers,","title":"Jenkins Election

would like to announce changes in the Jenkins Governance Board.\nAs it was announced earlier this month, Marky Jackson has decided to step down from his elected roles.\nOn behalf of the Jenkins community, we would like to thank Marky for all contributions and for the continued participation in the Jenkins community.\nAs an active Jenkins contributor and community leader, Marky helped a lot of initiatives to happen:\n Jenkins and Kubernetes ecosystem, terminology changes, GSoC and GSoD, pipeline authoring SIG and many more activities.\nThank you Marky!\n\nThe governance board has followed the interim procedure\nto nominate the new governance board member until the end of the term.\nThe board decided to respect the results of the 2020 elections and\nto nominate Ewelina Wilkosz who received the most of the votes after the elected candidates.\nShe has accepted the nomination, and on March 10th the Governance Meeting has confirmed it.\nWe are happy to welcome Ewelina Wilkosz as a new Governance Board Member!\n\nEwelina will join other governance Board Members:\nKohsuke Kawaguchi,\nUllrich Hafner,\nOleg Nenashev, and\nGavin Mogan.\nThe term will last until December 2022.\n\nAbout Ewelina Wilkosz\n\nEwelina has been a Jenkins Contributor since 2017, when she got involved in Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin development.\nVoted Most Valuable Jenkins Contributor in 2018.\nShe has 14 years of experience in IT, working as a CI/CD consultant since the beginning of 2017.\nIn that role she’s trying to solve numerous issues Jenkins users are facing daily - as developers, administrators, maintainers.\n\nHere is Ewelina’s statement from the elections:\n\nAs a consultant I support my customers with their Jenkins issues since the beginning of 2017.\nAnd almost from the start it was some kind of \"as code\" approach.\nThe experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.\nI consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.\nI appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is.\n\nI am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience\nwith Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.\nEvery day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.\nAs a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.\n\nThanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development\nI had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations\nwhere I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.\nHere are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:\nblogpost,\ncdCON presentation,\npodcast recording.\nSo my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,\nso I actually know what they need and why.\n\nWhat’s next for the Jenkins Governance Board?\n\nIn February we had the Jenkins Contributor Summit.\nThere we discussed many topics related to the Jenkins evolution and its roadmap.\nWe identified several initiatives we would like to focus on,\nincluding but not limited to improving user experience, contributor onboarding, and securing Jenkins delivery pipelines.\nThese initiatives will be a key focus until the next contributor summit we plan to organize in June.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and facilitating contributions to the project.\n\nParticipating in Jenkins Governance\n\nJenkins Governance Board has just a representative function in the community.\nThe project and the community have a long history of open and inclusive governance driven by many contributors.\nWe invite all community members to participate in the project by joining the\ngovernance meeting,\nparticipating in the mailing list conversations,\nand joining special interest groups driving particular topics.\n\nSee this page to know more about contributing to Jenkins in general.","title":"Welcome Ewelina Wilkosz - new Jenkins Governance Board

Jenkins community congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!\nLet’s take a look at some changes this year.\nWe would like to thank all awesome Jenkins users and contributors who have been with us during this year.\n\nHighlights\n\nSome of the key highlights:\n\nHundreds of first-timer contributors joined the community\n\nMajor UI/UX improvements in the Jenkins core, including the landing page, plugin manager, dark theme, and read-only configurations support\n\nOutreach programs like Google Summer of Code (7 projects), Google Season of Docs, UI/UX hackfest, etc.\n\nPublic roadmap for the project\n\nTerminology changes in the project, new Code of Conduct\n\nTechnical debt cleanup: XStream unforking, Acegi Security replacement, etc.\n\nContinued evolution of the plugin ecosystem, especially in the area of Cloud Native solutions and tool integrations\n\nContinued documentation cleanup, great progress with plugin documentation migration\n\nGraduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins User Interface and User Experience\n\nThis year there were many activities around Jenkins user experience and long-anticipated user interface changes.\nThis is a coordinated effort being led by the User Experience SIG, and by many contributors to the project.\nKey project highlights:\n\nLook & Feel updates of the Jenkins Web UI, including styling rework, new typography and layouts\n\nMajor rework of plugin management UI/UX\n\nDark theme for Jenkins\n\nAccessibility improvements\n\nSupport for read-only configuration pages\n\nIn May we also organized a Jenkins UI/UX hackfest where we worked on some key stories improving user experience.\n\nJenkins security\n\nIn 2020 the Jenkins security team has released 19 advisories for the Jenkins core, plugins and other components.\nIn total 198 vulnerabilities were fixed, and 72 plugin vulnerabilities were announced without a fix at the time of advisory publishing.\nAs a project, we are receiving a continuous flow of new reports and continue to provide corrections.\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were the most popular type this year, followed by unprotected credentials.\n\nThere have also been developer tooling improvements,\nincluding GitHub CodeQL evaluation for targeted security issues search\nand Find-Sec-Bugs adoption for static analysis of the plugin and Jenkins core code.\nAlong with wider adoption of Dependabot and automated dependency scanning on GitHub.\n\nDocumentation\n\nJenkins Documentation SIG is working on creating more documentation for Jenkins on different platforms,\nincluding cloud platforms.\nJenkins on Kubernetes was one of the key stories this year for the SIG,\nalong with documentation migration to jenkins.io and wider adoption of Documentation-as-code in plugins.\n95% of the 200 most installed Jenkins plugins have moved to \"documentation as code\" or have a pending pull request with updates.\nIn total, almost 600 plugins have already been migrated.\nThere were major updates in Jenkins documentation on jenkins.io, with a lot of content being moved from the old Jenkins Wiki.\n\n2020 was the first year when Jenkins participated in Google Season of Docs (GSoD).\nThis program brings together open-source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nThis year’s student, Zainab Abubakar,\ndid an amazing job documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nNow Jenkins users can find official documentation about deploying and scaling Jenkins in Kubernetes.\nSee the project report by Zainab here.\n\nJenkins Release Automation\n\nThe Jenkins project has delivered weekly and long term support releases since it was formed in 2011.\nThose releases were delivered by Kohsuke Kawaguchi from his release infrastructure.\n\nBeginning in April 2020, those releases are delivered by the new release automation setup.\nIt is hosted within the Jenkins’ Kubernetes cluster, with fully automated management and continuous delivery of services within the setup.\nWe transitioned to new build processes, new code signing certificates, and new release automation jobs.\nThanks to Olivier Vernin and all Infrastructure sub-project contributors for the successful completion of the release automation project!\n\nMoreover, there is ongoing work on continuous delivery of Jenkins plugins ( JEP-229) and on re-designing other Jenkins instances within the project (infra-ci, trusted-ci, and ci.jenkins.io for plugins).\nIn the next few months these stories should provide Jenkins contributors with a modern environment for CI and CD of all Jenkins components.\n\nTerminology updates\n\nSince July, we have officially replaced the old \"master\" terminology with the \"controller\" term.\nIt is a follow-up to the \"agent\" terminology introduced in 2016.\nWe have also deprecated usages of the “blacklist/whitelist” terminology in all components.\nCurrently the community is working on the cleanup of the remaining occurrences in the codebase and documentation, and we invite everyone to contribute.\n\nAs a part of the terminology cleanup, last spring we announced the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.\nAs a reminder, it does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.\n\nSee more information about terminology updates here and here.\n\n“Jenkins is the Way” program\n\nThis year the Advocacy and Outreach SIG started the “Jenkins is the Way” initiative which focuses on promoting user success stories.\nOver the year, the team published 54 user stories and six case studies on https://jenkinsistheway.io/ as well as a significant amount of community marketing.\nWe also published a number of testimonial videos advertising user stories,\nincluding this Introduction to \"Jenkins is the Way\" video.\n\nSee all the stories HERE\n\nEvents\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nIn 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.\nWe had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.\nAs usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.\nThe projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes needed for the long-term evolution of Jenkins.\n\nThis is the first-ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.\nIt was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!\n\nRead more: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/22/gsoc-report/\n\nJenkins in Hacktoberfest 2020\n\nIn October we participated in Hacktoberfest.\nOur featured projects included the Jenkins core, jenkins.io website and plugins.jenkins.io, Helm charts, and multiple plugins.\nWe also encouraged contributors to participate in the Documentation as Code and terminology cleanup across the entire Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nSee the details in the Hacktoberfest page.\n\nIn total we received 226 pull requests from Hacktoberfest participants.\nSome stats per Jenkins GitHub organization:\n\n'jenkinsci', PRs: 189, Hacktoberfest contributors: 61\n\n'jenkins-infra', PRs: 100, Hacktoberfest contributors: 40\n\n'jenkins-zh', PRs: 37, Hacktoberfest contributors: 2\n\nJenkins at DevOps World\n\nThe annual DevOps World,\nformerly known as DevOps World | Jenkins World held on Sept 22-24, with workshops on Sept 25.\nJust like other events in 2020, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that didn’t mean there was a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There were over 50 Jenkins/open-source.\nAnd a special congratulations is in order to this year’s Jenkins Contributor Award winners:\n\nJames Holderness - Jenkins security MVP\n\nMarky Jackson - Most valuable Jenkins advocate\n\nTim Jacomb - Most valuable Jenkins contributor\n\nBelow are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :\n\nJenkins Where It Is and Where It Is Going\n\nOne Jenkins to Rule them All\n\nJenkins UI Gets a Makeover\n\nJenkins Pipeline and DevSecOps for API Security\n\nGraduation at Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.\nIn August the project announced that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).\nThanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!\nBelow you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:\n\nWe introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.\nThis roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.\nIt makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters, and at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.\nThe roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in JEP-14.\n\nA new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.\nThis list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,\nincluding ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.\nPlease do not hesitate to add your company there!\n\nWe passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.\nThis certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices and to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).\nIt also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.\nDetails are on the Jenkins core page.\n\nJenkins Code of Conduct was updated to the new version of Contributor Covenant.\nIn particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.\n\nMore information can be found HERE, and HERE.\n\nPublic Roadmap\n\nThe Jenkins project now has a public, community-driven project roadmap.  Roadmap items are major initiatives and are considered as official plans.\nThe roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all areas of the project.\n\nMany of the 2020 released roadmap items are mentioned elsewhere in this document, including release automation, Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification,\nuser interface improvements, read-only configuration pages,\nand Google Summer of Code projects like the GitHub Checks API or External Fingerprint Storage.\n\nOther roadmap items include mirror infrastructure improvements, a new Windows installer,\nand preview releases of pluggable storage for external fingerprints, build logs, and unit test results.\n\nJenkins 2020 Elections\n\nIn October-December the Jenkins community held the regular elections.\nThis year we were  electing for 2 governance board members and for all five officer positions, namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation. These roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being. We thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.\n\nKey results:\n\nGavin Mogan and Marky Jackson joined the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nTim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer\n\nMarky Jackson became the new Events Officer\n\nOlivier Vernin, Daniel Beck, and Mark Waite will continue as Infrastructure, Security and Documentation officers\n\nFull election results: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/03/election-results/\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project,\nit is just a slice of the key highlights mentioned by the contributors.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day. We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size. Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc. THANKS A LOT TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTechnical changes. 2021 will be another busy year for the Jenkins community.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want Jenkins to succeed.\nThere are many areas on the roadmap : UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nThere will also be a continued cleanup of old dependencies and technical debt.\nSeveral key changes are expected to land in the March LTS baseline: update to Spring Security, XStream unforking, JQuery update, etc.( announcement).\nIn addition to that, we will keep working on expanding platform support in Jenkins, including provisioning support for new Java versions and official images for more architectures like Arm.\n\nDocumentation. Documentation efforts will continue in the next year,\nwith a focus on documenting Jenkins usage on modern platforms and and automation use-cases.\nWide adoption of documentation-as-code will also continue for plugins By this time almost 600 plugins have been migrated, but there are hundreds more plugins to go.\n\nSecurity. Another important area is Jenkins security. Automation tools like Jenkins are a key part of the software delivery process in organizations, and their security is essential for the security of products.\nMisconfigured or outdated systems are a common attack vector, but there are also areas for improvement on the project’s side.\nBe sure there will be security advisories and vulnerability fixes in 2021.\nWe plan to keep adopting best security development and software delivery practices, and to improve dependency management and developer tools in the project. These areas will be in the spotlight for the project next year.\n\nEvents. Next month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a virtual Jenkins stand there.\nThere will also be a CI/CD devroom.\nIf you are interested to meet Jenkins contributors, it is a great opportunity. We also plan to continue all outreach programs and on onboarding more contributors.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement).\nWe are also ready to consider other non-coding project ideas as a part of CommunityBridge.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nJoin us in 2021!\n\nWe are always looking for more contributors, regardless of the profile and experience.\nJenkins is a vast ecosystem which includes many modern technologies.\n\nWe invite Jenkins users and contributors to participate in the community and to move these initiatives forward!\nJoin us in the mailing lists and special interest groups,","title":"2020 A Year Like No Other","tags":["community","new-year-blogpost","governance"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

Jenkins community has recently completed the 2020 elections.\nOn behalf of the Jenkins community and the elections committee,\nwe congratulate all newly elected board members and officers!\nWe also thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.\n\nElection results:\n\nGavin Mogan and Marky Jackson will join\nKohsuke Kawaguchi, Ullrich Hafner and Oleg Nenashev\non the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nTim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer\n\nMarky Jackson will become the new Events Officer (uncontested)\n\nOlivier Vernin will continue in the role of Infrastructure Officer for another term (uncontested)\n\nDaniel Beck will continue in the role of Security Officer for another term (uncontested)\n\nMark Waite will continue in the role of Documentation Officer for another term (uncontested)\n\nThe board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being,\nand we are excited to see contributors taking these roles.\nIf you are interested to learn more, please see the blog post below.\n\nGovernance Board election details\n\nThis year we had nine candidates participating in Jenkins Governance Board elections:\nAndrey Falko, Ewelina Wilkosz, Frederic Gurr, Gavin Mogan, Justin Harringa,\nMark Waite, Marky Jackson, Steven Terrana, and Zhao Xiaojie (Rick).\nAll of them are awesome community leaders who actively contribute to the Jenkins project and\nrepresent its users.\nIt would be an honor to have them on the Jenkins board.\nRegardless of the election results, we appreciate their participation and the time they invested in these elections.\n\nThis year we were electing 2 governance board members.\nWe were using the Condorcet Internet Voting Service that allows voters to rank their choices rather than just picking their one favorite choice.\nYou can find full voting results here :\n\nMark Waite  (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nMarky Jackson loses to Mark Waite by 48–12\n\nGavin Mogan loses to Mark Waite by 51–10, loses to Marky Jackson by 31–20\n\nEwelina Wilkosz  loses to Mark Waite by 48–14, loses to Gavin Mogan by 29–28\n\nJustin Harringa  loses to Mark Waite by 51–11, loses to Ewelina Wilkosz by 35–16\n\nSteven Terrana  loses to Mark Waite by 47–16, loses to Justin Harringa by 20–19\n\nZhao Xiaojie (Rick)  loses to Mark Waite by 57–5, loses to Steven Terrana by 25–24\n\nFrederic Gurr  loses to Mark Waite by 52–10, loses to Zhao Xiaojie (Rick) by 25–24\n\nAndrey Falko  loses to Mark Waite by 56–6, loses to Frederic Gurr by 26–13\n\nAlthough Mark Waite came first in the voting results,\nbeing on the board would violate the Corporate Involvement clause which states that\n\"the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%\".\nMark will continue to be Documentation officer.\nRegardless of his official role, Mark has been leading many initiatives and helping a lot with various aspects of the community governance.\n\nCongratulations to Marky and Gavin, and thanks to all candidates!\nAll new board members are elected for a 2-year term unless they decide to step down earlier.\nThe estimated end of the term for them is December 02, 2022.\nWe would also like to thank Alex Earl and R. Tyler Croy who step down from the Jenkins Governance Board this year.\nThanks to them for all contributions and for continued community leadership.\n\nStatement from Marky Jackson:\n\nIt is a tremendous honor to be elected to this roles. I am so humbled.\nBeing part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.\nMy goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.\nI look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.\n\n— Marky Jackson, Jenkins Governance Board Member and Events Officer\n\nStatement from Gavin Mogan:\n\nGavin here. I’m still in shock that I got voted in for the Jenkins board.\nIt felt like yesterday I just got started helping people randomly on IRC. This is truly exciting.\nI plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.\nThis is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.\nMy specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.\n\n— Gavin Mogan, Jenkins Governance Board Member\n\nOfficer election details\n\nAll 5 officer positions were up for election this year.\nThese roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2021.\nAfter the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,\n4 officer positions were uncontested:\n\nOlivier Vernin - Infrastructure officer.\n\nMarky Jackson - Events officer.\nMarky inherits this role from Alyssa Tong\nwho decided to step down from the officer role and to focus on the Jenkins community marketing,\nincluding Jenkins Is The Way and many other initiatives started by Alyssa.\n\nMark Waite - Documentation officer.\n\nDaniel Beck - Security officer.\n\nThanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!\nOfficers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.\nIt requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.\n\nRelease Officer election results\n\nTim Jacomb won the biggest support as a Release officer ( voting results).\nTim will replace in this role Oliver Gondža\nwho has been leading the Release Team and the release processes since 2016 when the role was officially introduced.\n\nTim Jacomb (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nBaptiste Mathus  loses to Tim Jacomb by 40–23\n\nVictor Martinez  loses to Tim Jacomb by 38–25, loses to Baptiste Mathus by 32–31\n\nHere is a statement from Tim Jacomb:\n\nI’m excited for the year ahead, let’s see where we can take the Jenkins release area in the future.\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation, ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team,\nand ensure that responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.\n\n— Tim Jacomb, Jenkins Release Officer\n\nThanks to Alyssa Tong and Oliver Gondža for their long-time service as Jenkins officers!\nWe are looking to continue working with them in the Jenkins community.\nAnd congratulations to Tim Jacomb and Marky Jackson for joining the team!\n\nStatistics\n\nThis year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.\nIt is significantly lower than in the 2019 elections when we had almost 350 voters.\nIt can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.\nThis year we decided to not use the previous voter registration system,\nand we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.\nThis is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nThe last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.\nWith help of many contributors and with the renewed board,\nwe have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,\nfor example hosting contributor summits,\npublishing the public roadmap,\nCode of Conduct update,\nterminology changes,\nand graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.\nThere is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.\n\nIn short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.\n\nThere are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:\nlong-anticipated features and architecture changes,\nchanging the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process,\ncreating better communication channels with Jenkins users,\nand onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to contribute!\n\nFeedback\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe will appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process so that we can improve the process.\nWe have started a Retrospective document for these elections.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\nThere will be also a public retrospective review at the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meeting on Dec 17.\n\nIf you have any private feedback you would like to share,\nplease send an email to the Jenkins Board.\nIf you would like to raise any issues about the election process,\nplease contact one of the elected Governance Board members.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2020 election

As a member of the governance board,\nI’ll bring a fresh perspective by asking questions, providing feedback,\nand finding opportunities for others to contribute.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nLinkedIn\n\nAffiliations: Stripe\n\nEwelina Wilkosz\n\nAs a consultant I support my customers with their Jenkins issues since the beginning of 2017.\nAnd almost from the start it was some kind of \"as code\" approach.\nThe experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.\nI consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.\nI appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is.\n\nI am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience\nwith Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.\nEvery day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.\nAs a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.\n\nThanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development\nI had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations\nwhere I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.\nHere are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:\nblogpost,\ncdCON presentation,\npodcast recording.\nSo my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,\nso I actually know what they need and why.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nLinkedIn,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: Eficode (former Praqma)\n\nFrederic Gurr\n\nI started to use Jenkins back in 2008, when it still had a different name.\nIn 2011 I started to contribute and created my first little plugin called\nextra-columns.\nSince then, using and administering Jenkins servers has become a major part of my work life,\nwhile getting involved with the Jenkins community\nkickstarted my interest and involvement with open source software and communities.\n\nI’ve been working as a release engineer at the Eclipse Foundation since 2016,\nsupporting 250+ Jenkins instances for various open source projects.\nI’d be honored to bring a user and admin oriented perspective to the Governance Board and help\nshape the future of Jenkins.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: Eclipse Foundation\n\nGavin Mogan\n\nI got started with Jenkins early on when I was just getting started with testing.\nI knew there had to be a way to run the tests automatically and report on them back to people.\nI started hacking my own tools before I came across Jenkins (then Hudson) and was hooked ever since.\nOver the years I’ve managed to install and configure Jenkins at various jobs,\nand even was employed making internal and external plugins and integrations.\nYou’ll often find me on the Jenkins IRC and Gitter channels as well as the subreddit giving a hand to people who are stuck.\nI also try to get involved with Jenkins Infrastructure projects as much as I can.\nI currently maintain the plugin site, plugin site API, Jenkins Wiki exporter, and a bunch of other minor projects.\nI also help run Vancouver’s chapter of Nodeschool.\n\nIf elected, I would like to address improving commercial support avenues.\nRight now it’s a lot of people flailing in isolation.\nI would like to not only improve things so people can find easier ways to get help,\nbut also encourage more users to help others, and push for a\ncentralized source of companies providing commercial support.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: Digital Ocean, Nodeschool Vancouver\n\nJustin Harringa\n\nThe nomination is quite an honor for me.\nI have been a Hudson/Jenkins user since around 2009/2010 when\nI started working through driving continuous integration in a corporate environment at John Deere.\nAs time went on, I began contributing some small fixes to plugins such as the Job DSL Plugin, OpenID Plugin, and the Workflow Job Plugin.\nEventually, I ended up helping maintain Salesforce’s Chatter plugin and then open sourcing plugins such as the Config-Driven Pipeline Plugin with Andrey Falko.\nMore recently, I have also had the extreme pleasure of mentoring in 2 Jenkins projects for Google Summer of Code\n(Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab in 2019 and Git Plugin Performance Improvements in 2020).\n\nI have learned so much from working with Jenkins and I would love to give back to the project further.\nHaving introduced Jenkins at both small and large companies,\nI would love to help contribute to the direction of the project through the Roadmap/SIGs/JEPs and encourage others to also contribute / improve Jenkins.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nLinkedIn\n\nAffiliations: Salesforce, Spinnaker SIG for Azure\n\nMark Waite\n\nI’m a Jenkins contributor, a member of the Jenkins core team,\none of the leaders of the Platform Special Interest Group,\nand leader of the Documentation Special Interest Group.\nI’ve served as the Jenkins Documentation Officer since 2019.\nI was a mentor for Google Season of Code 2020 and am one of the maintainers of the Git plugin for Jenkins.\n\nIf elected and allowed to serve on the Jenkins Board, I’ll work to increase community involvement and community development.\nI’m deeply interested in tooling and environments that support the Jenkins project,\nincluding the Jenkins CI environments, issue tracker, artifact repository, and source code repositories.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nLinkedIn,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nMarky Jackson\n\nI have been involved in the Jenkins project for many years.\nI started out as a plugin maintainer, SIG member and general helper.\nI moved to a SIG lead, speakers and Google Summer of Code and Docs org admin and mentor.\nMy current goals are to help continue the work of the public roadmap as well and gain most community members by continuing to be a champion of the community.\n\nFor me, being on the Jenkins Board is another opportunity to improve upon the great work\nwe have all done as well as work toward branching out our efforts to have more women, people of color and LGBTQIA members.\nI would be honored to have this opportunity.\n\nProfile

contributor since 2018.\nI am the primary maintainer of the Jenkins Templating Engine,\na plugin that allows users to create truly templated Jenkins pipelines that can be shared across teams.\nThrough that work, I’ve had the great pleasure of helping to organize the Pipeline Authoring Special Interest Group,\ncontributing to the Jenkins Pipeline documentation, and contributing bug fixes to various plugins\n(including the pipeline plugin and workflow-cps library).\n\nAs a Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador,\nI’ve enjoyed doing what I can to advance the community’s approach to CI/CD and simplifying DevSecOps adoption within large organizations.\nIt would be a privilege to serve on the Jenkins Governance Board and offer my support wherever I can.\n\nProfile

process of contributing.\nI even became a Jenkins hero in my city.\nThe most exciting thing I want to do is help more new users of Jenkins get started, and let more contributors feel comfortable.\nI always love to host a JAM no matter if it’s online or offline.\n\nPlans: improve the experience of using Jenkins in different\ncountries; reorganize the knowledge of Jenkins, for example the tutorial\nby text or video format; help other SIG leaders to organize meetings.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: N/A\n\nRelease Officer\n\nBaptiste Mathus\n\nI have been using and contributing to Jenkins for so long that it is difficult for me to check when it started exactly.\nMy first pull-request to Jenkins was in 2011 and I had started to use it long before it.\nThroughout the years, I have contributed to various areas:\ncreated our local Jenkins Area Meetup with Michaël Pailloncy,\nhelped users and developers on our mailing lists and IRC channels,\ncontributed to the Jenkins infrastructure, the website,\nprocessing plugins hosting requests, worked full time on Jenkins Evergreen,\nand I am still present today.\n\nFor all these reasons, it would be an honor to serve as the Release Officer for the Jenkins Project.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nTim Jacomb\n\nI have been a user of Jenkins for the last 8 years and a regular contributor since 2018.\nI began with maintaining the Slack plugin and over the last couple of years I have since expanded that to many more plugins and the Jenkins core.\nThese are some of the components I maintain when I have time: Slack, Azure Key Vault, Junit,\nmost of the Database plugins, Dark theme, Plugin installation manager, Jenkins Helm chart, Configuration as code plugin.\nI am also a member of the Jenkins infrastructure team,\nand I was involved in the release automation project and the mirrors modernisation effort,\nalong with the day to day support helping people regain access to accounts etc.\n\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation,\nease onboarding of new contributors to the release team, and ensure that\nresponsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: Kainos\n\nVictor Martinez\n\nI have been involved in the Jenkins project since 2011 by different means, as a user, as an administrator, as a contributor\n(bug reporting, plugin development, documentation, hackfest),\nbeing active in the different Jenkins forums such as the Jenkins-dev and Jenkins-user mailing lists,\nworking with the jenkins-infra shared library and so on.\nI’m also an advocate for the Jenkins project through some presentations anytime that I had the opportunity such as\nDevOps World 2020 and\nJenkins World 2017.\n\nI’ve been happily nominated for the Release officer role which matches not just my area of professional expertise that\nI’ve been doing for the last 14 years in different roles for different companies but also that’s an area of personal interest\nwhere I’d like to spend time with the Jenkins community to understand, document and automate the process\nin a way we can keep the project sustainable for a long term as it’s today,\nit’s not just about what I can bring for the community but also about growing together.\n\nIf elected as a Release officer I would aim to focus on the following areas:\nproceed with the existing responsibilities for this role;\ndocument and automate the release process;\nbeing an enabler for the Continuous Delivery not just for the plugins but also for the core.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nLinkedIn\n\nAffiliations: Elastic\n\nSecurity Officer - uncontested\n\nDaniel Beck\n\nI’ve been a Jenkins user since 2011, contributor since 2013, and core maintainer since 2014.\nIn 2015, I took on the scheduling and authoring of security advisories and have been doing that ever since,\nworking with reporters, maintainers, and the Jenkins security team to deliver security fixes.\nBeyond that, I regularly contribute to Jenkins and project infrastructure.\n\nSince I’ve started in the Security Officer role, we’ve made significant\nimprovements:\nPlugins no longer allow ordinary users to run arbitrary scripts (no sandbox!) as a regular feature. I introduced fine-grained permission management\nfor our GitHub repositories and\nthe Maven repository hosting our releases.\nWarnings directly in Jenkins inform admins when an installed component has known security issues (and their UX was improved earlier this year).\nThe Jenkins project is now a CVE Numbers Authority,\nto ensure timely and high-quality information in the CVE vulnerability database.\nWorking with Tyler, I added telemetry to Jenkins,\nwhich allowed us to deliver multiple large-scale security fixes with\nminimal impact.\nMore recently, I’ve started writing code scanning rules for common problems in Jenkins and\ninvited maintainers to sign their plugins up,\nwhich is something I hope to properly publish and roll out more widely soon.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nEvents Officer -

uncontested\n\nOlivier Vernin\n\nI have been actively contributing to the Jenkins project for the past four years with contributions across many areas,\nand infrastructure is one of my favorite topics.\nOver my previous mandate as a Jenkins infrastructure officer, I focused on improving contribution experience,\nand let community members opportunities to take ownership of the different services.\nI worked on various sponsoring initiatives to make the Jenkins infrastructure more sustainable.\nWe provided a new environment for releasing Jenkins core (and one plugin!), and also many more things.\n\nFor the coming year, It is hard to make commitments on what it will look like as we have things we know,\nlike services that need some attention (“ci.jenkins.io/) and the things we don’t know yet.\nAnyway, It’s important to me to have a transparent project where everybody could read, learn, participate,\nand understand how the Jenkins project manages infrastructure and I want to continue down that path.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nDocumentation Officer -

The governance board has also met and there will be more information coming regarding removal of offensive terminology.\nLast week we took another step towards removing offensive terminology within the project by updating previous blog posts and removing offensive terminology in old blogs, cleaning up some references in Jenkins built-in documetation and localization, etc.\nThe meeting minutes are available here and a recording of the meeting here\nThere is more work to do.
