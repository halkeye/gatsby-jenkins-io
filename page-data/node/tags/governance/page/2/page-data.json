The governance board has also met and there will be more information coming regarding removal of offensive terminology.\nLast week we took another step towards removing offensive terminology within the project by updating previous blog posts and removing offensive terminology in old blogs, cleaning up some references in Jenkins built-in documetation and localization, etc.\nThe meeting minutes are available here and a recording of the meeting here\nThere is more work to do. The core team is working to address terms such as \"Master\", \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" as well addressing git branching terminology.\n\nWe could use your help\nWe continue to do this much needed work and would like to remind everyone that the Jenkins project is governed by the Code of Conduct.\n\nSincerely,\nMarky Jackson","title":"On Jenkins Terminology Updates","tags":["community","opensource","governance","documentation"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

project congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!\nLet’s take a look at some changes this year.\n\nHighlights\n\nWe celebrated 15 years of Jenkins\n\nWe had first ever Governance Board and Officer elections\n\nJenkins project joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)\n\nWe released Java 11 support in Jenkins\n\nJenkins X has graduated as a Jenkins sub-project and became a new project under umbrella of CDF\n\nIn October 2019 we reached the record high number of contributions: 915 unique contributors, 124 of them were first-timers\n\nWe started new special interest groups for Documentation and User Experience.\n\nA new position of the Documentation officer was introduced to highlight an important role of documentation in the project\n\nWe ran multiple mentorship programs with 12 mentees in total: Google Summer of Code, Hacktoberfest and Outreachy\n\nIf you are interested to know more about Jenkins features introduced in 2019,\nstay tuned for a separate blog post about it (coming soon!).\n\nProject updates\n\nHighlights above do not cover all advancements we had in the project.\nBelow you can find slides from the Jenkins contributor summit in Lisbon.\nThere we had project updates by officers, SIG and sub-project leaders.\nSee the slide deck to know about: Jenkins Core, Pipeline, Configuration-as-Code, Security, UX Overhaul, Jenkins Infrastructure, platform support and documentation.\n\nSome stats and numbers\n\nIf this section seems to be too long for you, here is some infographic prepared by Tracy Miranda.\nAs you may see, Jenkins is pretty big :)\n\nCommunity.\nOver the past year we had 5433 contributors in GitHub repositories (committers, reviewers, issue submitters, etc.).\nWe had 1892 unique committers who created 7122 pull requests and 45484 commits, bots excluded.\nContributors represent 273 companies and 111 countries, 8% of contributors are recognized as independent.\nThe most active repositories were Jenkins Core and jenkins.io.\nThe most active month was October 2019 when we reached the record high number of contributions: 915 unique contributors, 124 of them were first-timers, thanks to Hacktoberfest!.\n\nJenkins core.\nIn 2019 Jenkins core had 54 weekly and 13 LTS releases with several hundreds of notable fixes/enhancements.\nThere was a login screen extensibility rework, many update manager and administrative monitors improvements.\nWe also introduced support for user timezones, not speaking of emojis support 🥳.\nThere was also a lot of housekeeping work: better APIs, codebase refresh, cleaning up static analysis warnings and removing deprecated features like Remoting CLI.\nThe core’s components also got major updates.\nOnly Jenkins Remoting got 11 releases with stability improvements and new features like support of inbound connections to headless Jenkins controllers.\nThere are also major incoming features like jep:222[WebSocket Services support], UI look&feel updates, jira:JENKINS-12548[Readonly system configuration support], Docker images for new platforms like Arm.\nTo facilitate further changes we created a new Core pull request reviewers team and added 9 contributors there.\n\nPlugins.\nThere were 2654 plugin releases, and 157 NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.\nJenkins ecosystem got a lot of new integrations with Development and DevOps tools.\nAlso, warm welcome back to the Scriptler Plugin which was depublished in 2017 due to security issues.\nIf you are afraid about such plugin numbers and dependency management, there is a new Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool which should help Jenkins users to manage plugins more efficiently.\n\nSecurity.\nIt was a hot year for the Jenkins Security Team.\nThere were 5 security advisories for the core and 20 - for plugins.\nIn total we disclosed 288 vulnerabilities across the project, including some backlog cleaning for unmaintained plugins.\nScript Security Plugin was the hottest plugin with 10 critical fixes addressing various sandbox bypass vulnerabilities.\nPlain text storage and unprotected credentials were the most popular vulnerability type 120 disclosures in 2019.\nIt was made possible by hundreds of reports submitted by contributors after code surveys,\nspecial thanks to Viktor Gazdag who reported the most of the issues and became the Jenkins 2019 Security MVP (check out his story here).\n\nInfrastructure.\nGot Jenkins? If so, you rely on Jenkins update centers, website and issue tracker.\nAll these and many other services are maintained by the Jenkins Infrastructure Team.\nThis year the team handled more than 400 requests in the bugtracker, and many other informal requests.\nIn total, more than 30 people contributed to Jenkins infrastructure this year (website content is excluded).\nWe also deployed 4 new services, migrated 7 services from Azure Container Service to Azure Kubernetes Service and updated many other services.\nMore changes will happen in the next months, and we are looking for new INFRA team members!\n\nDocumentation.\nOnly last quarter we had 178 contributors to Jenkins documentation. It includes jenkins.io and other documentation hosted on GitHub, Wiki is not included.\nThere is also ongoing migration plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub ( announcement).\nSince the beginning of the project in Sep 2019, more than 150 plugin were migrated, and they got significant documentation revamp during the migration.\nYou can see the current status here.\nWe also work on introducing changelog automation in the project.\n123 plugins have already adopted the new changelog tools, powered by Release Drafter.\nAlso, we had more than 60 technical blog posts published on jenkins.io.\n\nConfiguration as Code was one of the most popular areas this year.\nJenkins Configuration as Code Plugin had more than 30 releases with new features and bug fixes.\nMore than 50 plugins have been also updated in order to offer better configuration-as-code support.\nAs a result, the JCasC Plugin got massive adoption this year (from 2000 to almost 8000 installations),\nand now it becomes a de-facto standard for managing Jenkins as code.\nThis year we also ran our very first CommunityBridge project devoted to JCasC Schema validation and developer tools.\n\nEvents and outreach programs.\nIn 2019 we participated in multiple conferences, including FOSDEM, DevOps World | Jenkins World, SCALE.\nMore than 40 Jenkins Area Meetups were organized across the world, and there were many other meetups devoted to Jenkins.\nWe also kept expanding our outreach programs.\nIn total we had 12 students who participated in Google Summer of Code, Outreachy and newly introduced Community Bridge.\nWe also had the biggest ever Hacktoberfest with 664 pull requests and 102 participants.\nThese outreach programs help us to deliver new features in Jenkins.\nFor example, this year we added Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab and a new Plugin Installation Manager Tool during GSoC,\nand Outreachy resulted in a new Audit Log Plugin.\n\nWhere did we get those stats?\nGitHub stats came from the CDF DevStats service.\nThese stats include all repositories in the jenkinsci organization and most popular repositories in jenkins-infra, Jenkins X and other organizations/repositories within the project are not included.\nOther stats came from project reports, component changelogs, Jenkins usage statistics service, plugin releases history.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nYear 2020 will be pretty busy for the Jenkins project.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want the project to succeed.\nAs it was written Board elections blogpost,\nthere are many areas to consider: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nIn the coming months there will be a lot of discussions in mailing lists and special interest groups,\nand we invite all teams to work on their roadmaps and to communicate them in the community.\n\nNext month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a Jenkins stand there.\nOn January 31st we will also host a traditional contributor summit in Brussels,\nwhere we will talk about next steps for the project, in terms of technical roadmaps and the project governance.\nIf you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join us at the summit!\nSee this thread for more information.\n\nWe also plan to continue all outreach programs.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement),\nand we will be also interested to consider non-coding projects as a part of other programs like CommunityBridge.\nWe also work on improving contribution guidelines for newcomers and expert contributors.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day.\nWe are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size.\nEverything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc.\nTHANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!","title":"Happy New Year!

Tyler Croy on the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nDaniel Beck was elected as Security Officer\n\nAlyssa Tong was elected as Events Officer\n\nNominations for Infrastructure, Release and Documentation officer positions were uncontested.\n\nOlivier Vernin was elected as Infrastructure Officer (uncontested)\n\nOliver Gondža was elected as Release Officer (uncontested)\n\nMark Waite was elected as Documentation Officer (uncontested)\n\nIf you are interested to learn more, please see the blog post below.\n\nBoard election details\n\nThe voting results are:\n\nOleg Nenashev (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nMark Waite loses to Oleg Nenashev by 181–127\n\nUllrich Hafner loses to Oleg Nenashev by 198–115, loses to Mark Waite by 171–133\n\nAlex Earl loses to Oleg Nenashev by 225–82, loses to Ullrich Hafner by 168–128\n\nOliver Gondža loses to Oleg Nenashev by 227–76, loses to Alex Earl by 151–136\n\nZhao Xiaojie (aka Rick) loses to Oleg Nenashev by 233–82, loses to Oliver Gondža by 160–131\n\nAlthough Mark Waite came second in the voting results, being on the board would violate the Corporate Involvement clause which states that \"the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%\".\nBased on that rule, the third seat Alex Earl will join the Jenkins board.\nAt the same time, Mark Waite will take the newly introduced role of Documentation officer.\n\nAll new board members are elected for a 2-year term, unless they step down earlier.\nThe estimated end of term for them is December 02, 2021.\nThe actual date will depend on the election schedule in 2021.\n\nOfficer election details\n\nWe have reelected all 5 officers for the new 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2020.\n\nAlyssa Tong won the biggest support as an Events officer ( voting results)\n\nDaniel Beck won the biggest support as a Security officer ( voting results)\n\nWhen an officer position has only one candidate that is willing to accept the nomination, there is no reason to vote on that position.\nThis year some nominees declined the nominations before the election happened, and 3 officer nominations were finally uncontested:\nOlivier Vernin - infrastructure officer,\nOliver Gondža - release officer,\nMark Waite - documentation officer.\n\nStatistics\n\nHere are some voting stats from these elections:\n\nTotal number of eligible accounts: 91,015\n\nTotal number of registered voters: 831\n\nTotal number of votes: 343\n\nThis election was hosted on the Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS).\nWhile preparing for the elections, we discovered that CIVS is unable to support our large number of eligible voters.\nWe created a voter registration system to identify voters and then registered those voters with CIVS.\nThe workaround required a slight voting delay.\nSpecial thanks to Olivier Vernin and Tracy Miranda who made it possible!\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nIn short term, the renewed board will focus on running the Jenkins governance processes (meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining next steps towards improving the project.\nOne of the priorities will be to organize knowledge and permission transfers to new board members so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThere are also pending activities like Jenkins' transition to Continuous Delivery Foundation which require attention from board members.\n\nFor longer term, there are some ideas floating around:\n  roadmap for key components,\n  long-anticipated architecture changes (UX revamp, pluggable storage, cloud native Jenkins),\n  adopting Linux Foundation best practices like Core Infrastructure Initiative,\n  contributor onboarding,\n  etc.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for further evolvement of the Jenkins project,\nand the board could help to facilitate them in the community.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to do so!\n\nFeedback\n\nWe will also also plan to conduct a public retrospective at one of the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meetings.\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process.\nPlease use the following channels for feedback and suggestions:\n\nThere is a Retrospective document in Google Docs.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\n\nFor ideas about the project improvements and next steps for the board,\nplease use the Jenkins Developers mailing list.\n\nFor private feedback, please send an email to the Jenkins Board or to Tracy Miranda.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2019 election announcement\n\n2019 election updates on Nov 08\n\nRetrospective

Jenkins community is conducting the 2019 elections for Board and Officer positions.\nThe call for nominations has concluded.\nWe received many nominations.\nBased on the people who are willing to accept their nomination and the uncontested officer positions, we will have 3 votes:\n\nA vote to elect 3 board members\n\nA vote to elect the Jenkins security officer\n\nA vote to elect the Jenkins events officer\n\nCandidates\n\nEach candidate has provided a statement to help guide voters on why they should vote for the candidate.\nRefer to the candidate statements for more details.\nThe candidates running for a board position are:\n\nAlex Earl\n\nOliver Gondza\n\nUllrich Hafner\n\nOleg Nenashev\n\nMark Waite\n\nZhao Xiaojie (a.k.a. Rick to many of you)\n\nThe candidates running for Security Officer are:\n\nDaniel Beck\n\nWadeck Follonier\n\nThe candidates running for Events Officer are:\n\nAlyssa Tong\n\nZhao Xiaojie (a.k.a. Rick to many of you)\n\nVoter Registration\n\nThis is the first time in a while that we are running a Jenkins election; we are learning as we go.\nJenkins elections aim to be very inclusive.\nWe do not restrict elections to just code committers.\nAnyone who has a Jenkins account registered before September 1, 2019 is eligible to vote.\nJenkins, being the successful project it is, has  approximately 100 000 accounts that meet that criteria.\nAs a result we are contacting eligible voters and requesting that they explicitly ‘opt-in’ to participate in the voting.\n\nIf you meet the criteria, you will receive an email at your registered jenkins.io email address.\nIt will be from elections@jenkins.io with the title ‘ 2019 Jenkins Election - Invitation to Participate ’.\nThe email will provide election details and will include an \" I want to participate\" button.\n\nVoter Confirmation\n\nOnce you click on the link, you should see a confirmation screen as follows:\n\nIf you do not receive the email by November 14, 2019 or if you have any problems voting, please comment on the Jenkins Election 2019 Jira issue.\n\nVoting\n\nThe voting will officially open on November 11, 2019.\nCandidates will receive an email from the Condorcet internet voting sent by Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\nOne email will be sent for each vote (so 3 in total: 1 for board, 1 for event officer and 1 for security officer).\nThe vote will ask to rank the candidates using a screen like this:\n\nElection Dates\n\nHere is a summary of the key election dates:\n\nDate\nEvent\n\nNow\nVoter registration ongoing\n\nNov 11, 2019\nVoting begins\n\nNov 17, 2019\nVoter registration closes\n\nNov 24, 2019\nVoting closes a 5:00 PM Pacific Time\n\nDec 3, 2019\nNew representatives announced\n\nElection results will be posted to the Jenkins developer mailing list, followed by an announcement blog post on jenkins.io.\n\nIf there are any delays to the proposed dates we will aim to communicate that as soon as we can.\nThank you very much for all the candidates showing the Jenkins spirit of service to their community.\nWe encourage everyone to register to vote and participate in the Jenkins community.\n\nUncontested Officer Positions\n\nWhen an officer position has only one candidate that is willing to accept the nomination, there is no reason to vote on that position.\nThe individual becomes an officer as the sole candidate for the position.\n\nUncontested officers include:\n\nName\nRole\n\nOlivier Vernin\nInfrastructure Officer\n\nOliver Gondza\nRelease Officer\n\nMark Waite\nDocumentation Officer\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\nAnnouncement in the developer mailing list\n\n2019 elections proposal in
