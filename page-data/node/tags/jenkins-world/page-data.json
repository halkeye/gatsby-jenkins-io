The sound isn’t great but it was a truly visionary talk:\n\nFinally the event finished with swag presentations and a fun Kahoot quiz to wrap things up.\n\nContributor Appreciation Event\n\nAfter the summit, contributors were invited to join at the after party at Spin.\nSpin was a unique venue in San Francisco where attendees could socialise and also play ping-pong!\nWhile some took it seriously most enjoyed the relaxed way to get to know their fellow contributors.\n\nSee you in Nice\n\nThe event was a lot of fun and the contributor summit in Nice will follow a very similar structure.\nAll levels of contributor are welcome, there will be lots of opportunity for in-depth discussions and you can even do an ignite talk!\nWhile we won’t be repeating the ping pong event there will be something equally unique to follow on from the summit.\n\nAttending is free, and no DevOps World | Jenkins World ticket is needed, but RSVP if you are going to attend to help us plan.\nSee you there!\n\nAs long as you’re in Nice for the Contributor Summit,\njoin Tracy, Kohsuke, and hundreds of other Jenkins users at\nDevOps World - Jenkins World on October 22-25.\nRegister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"What to Expect at the Jenkins Contributor
