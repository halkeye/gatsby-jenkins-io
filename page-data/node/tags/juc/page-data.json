This is the first JUCC in Beijing and we are overwhelmed by the interest and love for Jenkins. The conference had sessions in DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Jenkins X, Pipeline, and Container. The GreatOps community, event host, invited John Willis, a thought leader of DevOps to deliver the keynote speech. John’s topic was \"DevOps: Almost 10 years - What A  Strange Long Trip It’s Been.\" It was very insightful to learn of the history of DevOps and John’s point of view on the practice.\n\nLily Lin from Micro Focus presented, \"How to practice CI/CD for large-scale micro service based on Jenkins Pipeline.\"\n\nJames Rawlings, one of the core Jenkins X contributors traveled from the United Kingdom to present, \"Jenkins X for the future, Easy CI/CD for Kubernetes.\"\n\nAfter James’ presentation, there were many questions about Jenkins X, Jenkins users in China are very interested in Jenkins X. We all posed Jenkins \"X\" gesture.\n\nWe also invite Shuwei Hao from Alibaba, Michael Hüttermann who is the author of DevOps for Developers, Xiang Lu from CPI.\n\nMr Huaqiang Li and Xiaojie Zhao ran a workshop for help attendees master Jenkins Pipeline and Jenkins X in the cloud environment.\n\nHere are additional pictures from our event\n\nSpecial THANKS to BC who is the co-organizer of JUCC to host the main track and Alyssa and Maxwell for your help with our event.\n\nNext up, Jenkins User Conference China Shenzhen in November.\nLet’s Jenkins X and DevOps!","title":"Jenkins User Conference China Beijing Recap","tags":["event","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Forest runs\nthe <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/\">Shanghai Jenkins Area Meetup</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bagevent.com/event/jenkins-user-conference\">Jenkins User Conference China</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"fjing","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Forest Jing","slug":"/blog/author/fjing","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","id":"052134b8-bf47-5261-8b6e-17041407d5e3","slug":"/blog/2017/12/04/jenkins-user-conference-china-recap/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Forest Jing, who runs\nthe Shanghai Jenkins Area Meetup\n\nThe first Jenkins User Conference China was held on November 19, 2017 in\nShanghai, China. It was an amazing conference for Jenkins users in China. There were\nalmost 450 attendees to enjoy a lovely day with Jenkins creator, Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\n\nThere were 12 wonderful presentations, 1 workshop and 1 open space to set the stage for JUC China.\nThe day began with Kohsuke, welcomed to the stage by all the attendees here with their warm\napplauses. All of them are fans of Jenkins and Kohsuke.  Thanks to Kohsuke, he made a wonderful presentation to show the past, present and future of Jenkins for Chinese Jenkins users.\n\nThe co-founder of DevOps Times community, Le Zhang released a report of adoption of Deployment Pipeline in Chinese IT organization.\nThe report shows that Jenkins is the most popular tool for DevOps and CD in China.\n\nIt also has proven that “If it hurts, do it more often!” is right because the IT organization who deploy more frequently, deployment  failure would be less.\n\nThe Three Musketeers of DevOps in China (Le Zhang, Xuefeng Shi,Forest Jing) have demonstrated a DevOps pipeline based on Jenkins and many open-source software such as Kubernetes, Gitlab, etc.\n\nAfter the presentation, lots of fans waited in line to take pictures with Kohsuke.\n\nHere are some photos of the JUC China. We really enjoyed it.\n\nLastly, as an organizer for JUC China, I would like to thank Kohsuke Kawaguchi, Alyssa Tong, Sam Van Oort and so many friends from CloudBees and Jenkins community to have given us so many help to make the first JUC China an amazing and successful conference for Jenkins users in China. We look forward to organizing many more JUC China.","title":"Jenkins User Conference China Recap","tags":["event","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/8d248/alyssat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/c004c/alyssat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/9e67b/alyssat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/22924/alyssat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/89767/alyssat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/40d97/alyssat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/5028e/alyssat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":166}}},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"/blog/author/alyssat","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","id":"54daf997-6adf-5784-ac6a-b0973df0dead","slug":"/blog/2015/09/03/jenkins-user-conference-west-day-1/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CN6MLZnUsAAj0RD.jpg[image,width=300] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nBoy, what a day!

If you are a long-time user, you might even view the configuration page with that same reassuring nostalgia seeing a Facebook post from your ugly room mate induces. ‘Yup,he is still ugly and backwards, but we had some good times, back then.’ If you are a newer Jenkins user, it may well send you off to search the web for a viable alternative tool. +\n\n+\nThe good news is that CloudBees, in cooperation with the greater Jenkins community, is looking to make some long overdue progress sorting through this user interaction in a way that is both approachable to new users and amenable to existing users who have grown comfortable with a great tool and a ‘stalwart friend’ in a world of otherwise clunky world of IT tools. ( that really is the swiss army knife of build automation.) +\n\n+\n\nIf you happen to have had the opportunity to have attended any of the recent Jenkins User Conferences in Washington, DC, or London, you may have seen Tom and my presentation, which served as our initial introduction of this effort to the Jenkins Community. In this article and the associated video, I will be focusing specifically on the Create and Configuration screens in Jenkins, discussing some of the larger proposed changes, providing some context for the changes and examining their possible repercussions on existing plugins and future plugin development.\n\n+\n+\n\nHistory of Jenkins\n\n+\n\n+\nFor newer Jenkins users, I have found the following visual a helpful guide to understanding the history of Jenkins and how its graphical user interfaces has evolved:\n\n+\n +\nimage:/sites/default/files/images/history-jenkins_590.jpg[Jenkins timeline: a long history] +\n\n+\nThe first thing to notice here, is that Jenkins has been around for a long time and in a lot of ways is really fundamental to the art of creating software. Back in 2005, the then Hudson project was using pretty much the same cave chalk as everyone else. 6 years later, the code and community underwent its most substantial transformation to date, as Jenkins emerged as the dominant fork of the Hudson project. If you look closely, you will see the GUI reflected that transformation by….. changing the picture of the butler. In recent times, the interface has taken a few additional steps forward, most notably by moving to a responsive CSS driven layout from its table based origin, but the pace of these changes has been very much akin to the pace of evolution. Slow. +\n\n+\nIn our next phase of graphic interface development, however, Tom and I are looking to be a little more directed in our efforts and push the GUI toward a blend of strategic and tactical advancements that will help Jenkins take advantage of some of the advances in web design and browser technologies that have happened over the last 10 years. Our first major push will be in the job creation and configuration tasks. +\n\n+\n\nCreating and Configuring\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nIn addition to a bit of a refresh of the look of these forms, this new effort focuses on the importance of dividing information and presentation into clear categories that ideally are meaningful to both new and veteran users of Jenkins alike.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn some cases, Jenkins has these categories already in the GUI, but misses the mark in clarification and emphasis. In other cases, additional categorizing concepts will need to be added. Compare the above screens to the existing screens.\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\nThe first thing you are likely to notice when comparing these two sets of screens is that in the existing screens, there is very little in the way of visual markers segmenting the form input choices on either the item type selection screens (fig 4 vs 2) or the configuration pages (fig 5 vs 3). Adding each new plugin progressively aggravates the situation, and consequently, as your Jenkins installation grows in sophistication and robustness, the average users ability to find the fundamental configuration settings in the sea of ad-hoc options diminishes. While adding functionality typically adds some amount of additional complexity to a UI, by giving each configuration option a visually distinguishable space in the form, the challenge can be greatly diminished and the pattern of creating an ever growing scrolling of toilet paper list of form elements can be avoided.\n\n+\n\nFor figures 2 and 4, you might also notice that I have chosen Jenkins instances that already have several plugins installed as the basis for my example screens. You might rightly argue that for a basic install, there are not a lot of item types to create, so categorizing them adds a needless layer of complexity. Fair enough. It is my belief, though, that our software can be smart enough to count the item types available for creation and count the number within each category and handle the categorization as necessary. Counting and sorting is something that computers do incredibly well and is not the sort of thing busy people need to be overly burdened with.\n\n+\n\nIn addition to the code being intelligent about when to present grouping categories to the user, The screen interaction can be similarly intelligent in how it enables the user to selectively show and hide the categories of interest. The following screenshot shows the configuration page focused in on CVS a particular option configuration in the source code management section of the configuration page. It, in turn, has its own sub settings for additional modules and locations (see fig 6).\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\n…​and wait for it…​ …​for comparison, here is today’s CVS settings page…​\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\nDespite some serious indentation, the existing page offers significantly less clarity about which settings pertain specifically to CVS instead of other aspects of a Jenkins job.\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\nIdentifying which settings go with which segment becomes all the more confusing when sub-sections can be re-ordered. To show you what I mean and fit the screen on a single printed page, I am needing to muck with the aspect ratio of today’s screen.\n\n+\n\nThe image on the left (fig 7) shows a 2 step build process, each with sub parameters.\n\n+\n\nThere are some fascinating looking red delete buttons in here, I hope I know exactly what part of the build step I am about to blow away…​. Did I mention these segments can be re-ordered? Care to guess which form inputs will move with which steps?\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\nBy contrast, the above screen shows the same 2 build steps with the same parameters. We still have our friend, Mr. Red Delete button, but now it is a good bit clearer who will get blown away.\nAlso, it is considerably clearer which block will be reordered, should I choose to do so.\n\n+\n\nWhat about plugins?\n\n+\n\nIf you are a long-time Jenkins user, you may have a guess as to why some of these changes have been slow in coming, and if you are a plugin developer, you definitely know. These input controls have a lot of extension points in them that allow plugins to influence the content of this configuration screen. As a result, how plugins will respond to even the most minor layout changes is somewhat of a mystery. Further, the GUI control elements that make up the form are available to plugin authors to embed as they see fit in their own GUI elements. As a consequence, we have some serious compatibility issues ahead. These challenges are not at all trivial.\n\n+\n\nFortunately, however, I believe with some careful manipulation and diligent testing we can overcome these challenges. The first set of changes are likely to revolve around a file called “hudson-behavior.js”. This file does most of the Jenkins client-side UI magic. If there is data to be bound to a control, this is the file that is likely to handle it. The difficulty with this file stems from two factors, its age (it is written following Yahoo UI framework patterns which have since been abandoned by Yahoo and the rest of the industry), and a presumption that the page layout will be governed by a single giant HTML table (likely due to the table renaissance happening around the same time, thanks to the emergence of GWT). Regardless of this bit of history trivia, these two issues combine to make changes to the HTML DOM structure of any Jenkins page problematic. Methods such as “findFollowingTR” assume a very rigid parent-child element positioning based on page layout rather than on the logical relationship between the data elements. The good news here is that despite some of their unfortunate names, can be refactored to both find the relevant element based on today’s table structure as well as a future logical nesting of related elements. With that change in place, Jenkins will continue to function as it always has and a future configuration DOM structure can share the same infrastructure.\n\n+\n\n+\nThe second step here will be finding efficient ways to integrate more modern Javascript libraries, such as JQuery and Bootstrap into the Jenkins GUI. We will want these libraries to be easier and cleaner for plugin authors to access than PrototypeJS and Yahoo UI are today. Likely this will involve using a Browserify/Requirejs like pattern to control script inclusion in page to avoid naming conflicts, excessively file attachment and global space pollution.\n\n+\n\nThe final step would then be to begin amending, replacing and augmenting the Jelly based form control set, and thus, transforming the look and behavior of the Jenkins UI. As always, Jenkins is an open community, and we at CloudBees view that as a cherished cornerstone of our own corporate culture. Thus, at every phase of this undertaking we are eager to solicit feedback from and encourage participation by you the members of the community. Feel free to comment directly on this article. Additionally, I am maintaining and active thread on the Jenkins Developer group ( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/6BdWZt35dTQ).
