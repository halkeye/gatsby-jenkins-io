I have this impression that Israeli people form a close-knit community on their own (somewhat like Japanese people do), perhaps because of the difference in the language or the culture. One of the great things about those communities are that people are well connected, and so reaching the right ears and spreading the ideas are easier. JUC Israel turns out to be the biggets JUC we had this year. Shlomi told me that some 230 people registered and 240 people showed up, and this negative last-minute cancellation ratio is unheard of! We had booths from sponsors, 2 concurrent tracks of technical talks, and wonderful Israeli food, in a nice hotel by the beach. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/296/category/5/created-monthly-list-2012-7[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712090747-e447b7c7.jpg[image] +\n] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nFor me, the conference started the night before, when JFrog folks took us to the Hudson restaurant, which was a wonderful steak house. Needless to say I took a lot of pictures. Hudson was great, and I got a wet-wipe in the end to wipe my hands off with Hudson. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/324/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712091422-d48662cb.jpg[image] +\n] +\n\n+\n+\n+\n\n+\nAs for the hightlights from the sessions. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/363/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712092442-6b807f97.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nAfter I and Shlomi have done the keynote, Amir from HP did a wonderful job showing off how he uses the multi-configuration project type (AKA \"matrix project\".) This is one of the areas where we made a lot of improvements lately, and one that I highlighted in my talk. I've always been feeling that this feature needs to be advertised more, so it was just perfect in that regard. It was also very useful for me personally, as I got some inspirations about improvements while he talks. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/384/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093014-62a9271b.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nSacha then talked about why the future of server-side applications are in PaaS. He had this one point where he said increasing the failure rate of software projects isn't necessarily a bad thing — if in a time frame of a year, you can do 10 projects and 2 succeed, then while that's only 20% success rate, it's better than doing 4 projects in the same time and having only 1 succeed. IOW, a machine-gun does a far more damage than a pistol, even though their accuracy can be much lower. And PaaS/Continuous-delivery plays a central role here becauses those are what lets you deliver 10 features in a year, instead of 4. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/397/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093400-c7816855.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nEyal from RedHat and Ronen from Ginger did two sessions showing off their use of Jenkins. One of the common theme in them is to use a text format (Puppet for Eyal and Groovy DSL for Ronen) to manage definitions of a large number of jobs. I think there's a lot of value in managing job definitions outside the current GUI, and I'm going to encourage Ronen to move his Groovy DSL project into the Jenkins CI project. I also felt that the template feature in Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees was validated, as it provides a similar capability (and in my opinion more easily deployable.) +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/391/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093221-0c896346.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nAnother talk that made a strong impression on me was the introductory plugin development talk from Noam, who works for JFrog and develops the Jenkins Artifactory plugin. I expected there to be only like 20-30 people, but it turns out about half the audience is there, indicating the high degree of interest to customizing Jenkins! In the past, all my favorite JUC talks came from those who I call \"super Jenkins admins\" who not only figure out how to combine some plugins, but also developed a few glue plugins. And those those extra finish makes all the difference! +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/411/category/5[ +\nimage:https://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/07/12/20120712093759-5aec89e0.jpg[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThe conference concluded with a social in the garden looking a sunset into the Mediterranean sea.

A hundred other like-minded continuous integration enthusiasts and I packed a very posh Marriott Marquis for a full day of Jenkins excitement.\n\nFamed Hudson and Jenkins founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi delivered the opening address to a crowded room.\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zONIv2yCm1s/T7pLy0yCalI/AAAAAAAAANg/hXadCIg5XC0/s1600/kohsuke.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zONIv2yCm1s/T7pLy0yCalI/AAAAAAAAANg/hXadCIg5XC0/s320/kohsuke.jpg[image,width=239,height=320]]\n\n+\nI'm sure everyone knows the statistics by now, that Jenkins adoption and development continues at an unbridled pace. Pushing past all the mailing list users and posts, the JIRAs opening and closing, the Twitter followers, the *five* Jenkins User Conferences scheduled for this year, the unprecedented number of installations reporting anonymous usage, the native availability for *nine* different OSes, in pushing past all of that.. +\n +\nFor me, the most impressive number was that on average there was about 1 plugin created every day over the past year. Let me reiterate that: *1 plugin created every day for a year*. If that isn't the best testament to the versatility, extensibility, and just plain usefulness of a piece of software, then I don't know what would be! +\n +\nAnnounced at the conference was the general availability of https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees BuildHive], this is a mechanism for quickly and easily obtaining access to cloud-based Jenkins. If you have projects on https://github.com/[GitHub], you can effortlessly log in to BuildHive via GitHub OAuth, import your projects with literally a single click, and start benefiting from the powerful promise of the cloud. You'll no longer have to worry about managing infrastructure, you'll just get all that great Jenkins CI capability for your projects immediately. +\n +\n +\n +\nWith BuildHive enabled projects, if a user of your project creates a pull request, then it will automatically pre-test that request before it hits the master tree -- https://github.com/jenkinsci/naginator-plugin/pull/2#issuecomment-5732481[commenting inside the pull request] whether or not the change broke the build. If a developer wants to test some changes before pushing them to the master tree, there's the https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb[Validated Merge feature], which can be used to screen commits before they land in master. Both of these features are wickedly awesome, to not use them would be a mistake for any F/OSS community. +\n +\nI would encourage you to try out BuildHive, it's already active for most/all of the Jenkins plugins. There's also an existing https://groups.google.com/d/topic/jenkinsci-dev/kqPAOziY1as/discussion[RFC thread] which is in discussion for making this the de facto location for Jenkins plugin on Jenkins testing. Please give it a shot and then post your comments. +\n +\nAside from this major announcement, I think the most interesting perspective I took away from the conference was the sheer diversity of Jenkins exploitation. People are using it on all sorts of hardware platforms, from mobile to cloud, on all sorts of languages from Java and C/C++ to Python and Ruby. I was also impressed with how many teams are using Jenkins as part of their mission critical business process. +\n +\nFinally, I'd like to thank all the Jenkins developers and users for making it the best continuous integration software available today.
