The JUC agenda has been expanded this year to cover two days! That means you get twice as many opportunities to learn how others are using Jenkins and to network with other Jenkins users.\n\n+\n+\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS IS OPEN FOR ALL JUC CONFERENCES\n\n+\n+\n\nWe need JUC speakers! The Call for Papers is open now and you can apply here. This is an opportunity for YOU to give back to the community by sharing your Jenkins knowledge and success. Jenkins speakers contribute significantly to the overall JUC experience.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn return for speaking, you will receive free admission to the conference and fame/fortune within the Jenkins community. OK, we can’t guarantee the latter, but we can guarantee the former! Hurry and apply now, because the Call for Papers deadline for US East and Europe expires on March 22, 2015.\n\n+\n+\n\nNot interested in speaking? Another way to contribute to the community is by letting us know who you want to hear from. Nominate or refer that amazing speaker and we’ll do the rest.

Any organization can do this – whether a vendor that sells into the Jenkins ecosystem or a company that has received value from Jenkins and wants to give back to the community. You can find out more here.

Sponsors would like to know more about attendees, but attendees are often weary of getting contacted. Our past few JUCs have been run by making it opt-in to have the contact information passed to sponsors, but the ratio of people who opt-in is too low. So we started thinking about adjusting this. +\n +\n\n+\nSo our current plan is to reduce the amount of data we collect and pass on, but to make this automatic for every attendee. Specifically, we'd limit the data only to name, company, e-mail, and city/state/country you are from. But no phone number, no street address, etc. We discussed this in http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2014/jenkins.2014-07-09-18.02.html[the last project meeting], and people generally seem to think this is reasonable. That said, this is a sensitive issue, so we wanted more people to be aware. +\n +\n\n+\nBy the way, https://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb[the call for papers to JUC Bay Area] is about to close in a few days.
