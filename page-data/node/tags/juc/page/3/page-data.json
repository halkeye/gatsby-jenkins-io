With 1001 seats, it was the largest, most modern and most popular film theatre in the former GDR and has since been extensively modernized in line with the requirements of historically listed buildings.\n\nWe have an excellent line-up of speakers filling up two conference tracks.\n\nOnce again, we have some fabulous sponsors to thank. Without them, there would be no JUC.\n\nThis year weâ€™ve introduced a new Community sponsorship level, which allows non-corporate groups like JUGSs to help support the conference as well. (Drop a note to juc-oc-ext AT cloudbees DOT com if your group is interested).\n\nWe are very grateful to all of our sponsors â€“ thank you! Hopefully see everyone at JUC.\n\nPS â€“ if you are coming to Berlin for JUC, check out the CD Summit on June 24 at the same venue. Thereâ€™s also one on June 19 in NYC.
