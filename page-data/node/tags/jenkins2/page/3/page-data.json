For months we have had builds\navailable from the jenkins_2.0\nbranch of development, but the \"alpha\" builds mark Jenkins 2.0 being\nofficially made available for testing and feedback.\n\nDownload 2.0-alpha now\n\nJenkins 2.0 Highlights\n\nPipeline as Code\n\nThe new Pipeline functionality in Jenkins allows you\nto define configuration as code, which can be checked in and version controlled\nalong with the rest of your project’s source code.\n\nDefining your pipeline’s configuration as code makes it easier to create a\nsimple \"build and test\" pipeline, while enabling more advanced and complex\npipelines through the expressive Groovy-based domain specific language.\n\nOut of the box experience\n\nFor new users, Jenkins 2.0 starts off with set of recommended plugins, seen in\nthe image above,  to help get you started with the right set of tools to get up\nand running with Jenkins quickly.\n\nFor the more adventurous users, the Jenkins 2.0 initial setup process\nalso allows you to pick and choose exactly the plugins you want to meet\nyour specific needs.\n\nTotally backwards compatible\n\nJenkins 2.0 is a drop-in replacement of the Jenkins 1.x series of releases\nand fully backward compatible. There will be practically no reason not to\nupgrade once 2.0 is released in the next couple of months.\n\nTell us what you think!\n\nWe’re very interested in your feedback on what you think of the Jenkins 2.0\npreview releases.\n\nIf you use Twitter, you can leave us some feedback\non\nTwitter\n\nOur jenkinsci-users\nmailing list is also available for feedback in\nthis thread\n\nAnd of course, since this is a preview release, if you find any issues please\nreport them to our\nissue tracker\nto the JENKINS project.","title":"Jenkins 2.0 alphas released","tags":["core","jenkins2"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
