to all GSoC students who have made it through the first half of the GSoC 2021 coding phase!\n\nThis year, the Jenkins project has been participating in GSoC as part of the Continuous Delivery Foundation‚Äôs GSoC org.\nTo celebrate our GSoC students and the fantastic work they have been doing, the CDF is hosting an online meetup where students will present their work.\nStudents will be showcasing what they have learned and accomplished thus far in GSoC, demoing their work, and discussing their goals and plans for the second coding phase.\n\nThe CDF Google Summer of Code Midterm Demos will be held online on July 20th, 13:00 UTC - 15:00 UTC.\n\nSign up here: Meetup Event\n\nSpeakers\n\nAkihiro Kiuchi - Jenkins Remoting Monitoring\n\nAkihiro is a student in the Department of information and communication engineering at the University of Tokyo.\nHe is improving the monitoring experience of Jenkins Remoting during Google Summer of Code 2021.\n\nAffiliation: The University of Tokyo and Jenkins project\n\nGitHub: Aki-7\n\nTitle: Jenkins Remoting Monitoring with OpenTelemetry\n\nIn this talk, he will discuss the problems in maintaining Jenkins agents and how to support Jenkins admins in troubleshooting them.\nAs one of the solutions, he will introduce the new Remoting monitoring with OpenTelemetry plugin that collects Jenkins Remoting monitoring data and troubleshooting data using OpenTelemetry.\nWhat kind of data the plugin will collect and how we will be able to visualize them using available open-source monitoring tools will be demonstrated.\n\nShruti Chaturvedi - CloudEvents Plugin for Jenkins\n\nShruti is an undergrad student of Computer Science at Kalamazoo College.\nShe is developing a CloudEvents integration for Jenkins, allowing other CloudEvents-compliant CI/CD tools to communicate easily.\nShruti is also the Founding Engineer of a California-based startup, MeetKlara, where she is building serverless solutions and advocating for developing CI/CD pipelines using open-source tools.\n\nAffiliation: Kalamazoo College and Jenkins project\n\nGitHub: ShrutiC-git\n\nLinkedIn: Shruti Chaturvedi\n\nTitle: CloudEvents Plugin for Jenkins: Moving Towards Interoperability\n\nIn this talk, we will look at interoperability as an essential element in building workloads across several services.\nWe will also talk about how CloudEvents solves one of the biggest challenges in achieving interoperability between systems: lack of normalization/standardization.\nWithout any standard definition, in order to achieve interoperability, services have to develop adapters specific to a particular system.\nThat, however, is complex because services are always changing the way data/events are emitted.\nCloudEvents solves this problem by defining a standard format for events, which can be emitted/consumed agnostically, thereby achieving indirect interoperability.\nShruti will demonstrate the workings of CloudEvents Plugin for Jenkins; she will walk us through how Jenkins can be configured as a source and a sink, emitting and consuming CloudEvents-compliant events in a platform-independent manner.\n\nDaniel Ko - try.spinnaker.io\n\nDaniel is studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.\nHe is developing a public Spinnaker sandbox environment for Google Summer of Code 2021.\n\nAffiliation: University of Wisconsin - Madison and Spinnaker project\n\nGitHub: ko28\n\nTitle: try.spinnaker.io:  Explore Spinnaker in a Sandbox Environment!\n\nThe talk will go through a brief explanation of Spinnaker and the challenges that users face during the installation process.\nHe will discuss the infrastructure of this project and how a public multi tenant spinnaker instance will be managed and installed.\nWe will end with a demo of the site so far and the various features implemented, including Github authentication, K8s manifest deployment, AWS Load Balancer Controller to expose deployments, private ECR registry and the blocking of all public images, and auto resource cleanup.\n\nAditya Srivastava - Conventional Commits Plugin for Jenkins\n\nAditya is a curiosity driven individual striving to find ingenious solutions to real-world problems.\nHe is an open-source enthusiast and a lifelong learner.\nAditya is also the Co-Founder and Maintainer of an Open Source Organization - Auto-DL, where he‚Äôs leading the development of a Deep Learning Platform as a Service application.\n\nAffiliation: V.E.S.I.T & Jenkins project\n\nGitHub: ADI10HERO\n\nLinkedIn: Aditya S.\n\nTitle: Conventional Commits Plugin for Jenkins\n\nIn this talk, we‚Äôll start with what are conventional commits and why they are needed.\nThen we‚Äôll see what the jenkins plugin, \"Conventional Commits\" is and what goal it is trying to achieve.\nA demo of how the plugin can be used/integrated in the current workflow will be shown.\nFinally, we‚Äôll talk about the next steps in plugin development followed by the QnA.\n\nHarshit Chopra - Git credentials binding for sh, bat, and powershell\n\nHarshit Chopra is a recent graduate and is currently working on a Jenkins project which brings the authentication support for cli git commands in a pipeline job and freestyle project.\n\nAffiliation: Punjab University & Jenkins Project\n\nGitHub: link: arpoch\n\nLinkedIn: Harshit Chopra\n\nWebsite\n\nTitle: Git credentials binding for sh, bat, and powershell\n\nIn this talk, he will give an overview of the project and will move on further explaining what problems are being faced, a bit about the workaround that are being used to tackle the problems,\nwhat makes the authentication support so important, why a feature and not a plugin in itself, accomplishments achieved and work done during the coding phase 1, will talk about the implementation of the feature, demonstration of git authentication support over HTTP protocol.\n\nPulkit Sharma - Security Validator for Jenkins Kubernetes Operator\n\nPulkit is a student at Indian Institute of Technology,BHU,Varanasi.\nHe is working on a GSoC Project under Jenkins where he aims to add a security validator to the Jenkins Kubernetes Operator.\n\nAffiliation: Indian Institute of Technology, BHU and Jenkins Project.\n\nGitHub: sharmapulkit04\n\nTitle: Security

Code Africa is a non-profit organization focused on celebrating and empowering young girls and women in technology across Africa.\nThey provide resources and events that help women grow and achieve their personal and career goals.\nTheir mentoring programs provide help and guidance as participants learn and grow in their careers.\n\nThis year, She Code Africa is organizing the She Code Africa Contributhon.\nContributhon is a boot camp where African women are paid to work with open source organizations on selected projects with dedicated mentors.\nThis program aims to create a more diverse, inclusive, and innovative culture within the African open source ecosystem by matching African women in technology with sponsor and mentor open source organizations.\n\nJenkins in She Code Africa Contributhon\n\nThe Jenkins project has been accepted as a Contributhon mentoring organization.\nOur project idea will introduce participants to Jenkins and plugin development as they create Pipeline examples and create Pipeline help for Jenkins Pipeline plugins.\nParticipants will learn more about Jenkins Pipeline and will submit plugin pull requests with examples and online help.\n\nThe Jenkins Pipeline Steps Reference and Pipeline online help often receive feedback that more examples are needed, that step return values need to be described, and that arguments need more description of their purpose, allowed values, and expected results.\nMost plugin maintainers do not provide detailed documentation of the pipeline steps, or the arguments to those pipeline steps.\nThis project will improve the documentation of pipeline steps and their arguments while introducing Jenkins Pipeline, Jenkins plugin development, Jenkins documentation as code, and the concepts of GitHub forks and pull requests.\n\nWe‚Äôve identified development tasks that up to three Contributhon participants will complete during April.\nThe tasks will introduce the participants to Jenkins plugin development.\nThey will experiment with plugin changes in Jenkins and submit pull requests to provide Pipeline examples and help.\nThey will meet twice a week with Jenkins mentors, Kristin Whetstone, Mark Waite, and Meg McRoberts to review their progress, provide coaching, and help with issues.\n\nData driven choices\n\nWe‚Äôve been collecting Jenkins documentation feedback since 2017.\nNow we‚Äôre using that feedback to prioritize the plugins to improve as part of this project.\nThe top 10 Pipeline plugins that have received the most feedback are:\n\nBuild step\n\nSCM step\n\nGit step\n\nInput step\n\nNodes and processes steps\n\nWorkspace cleanup step\n\nBasic Pipeline steps\n\nSlack notification steps\n\nHTTP request step\n\nEmail extension steps\n\nWhat about my plugin?\n\nIf you are a plugin maintainer and would like help to add examples and online help for the Pipeline steps in your plugin, send email to the Jenkins Documentation mailing list.\nWe‚Äôll consider including additional plugins as we better understand the development pace for She Code Africa participants.","title":"Jenkins accepted in She Code Africa

behalf of the Jenkins GSoC org team,\nI am happy to announce that this year, for the first time, the Jenkins projects will be participating in\nGoogle Summer of Code 2021\nas part of the\nContinuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) GSoC organization.\n\nWe‚Äôre very excited to have the Jenkins project participate in GSoC as part the CDF mentoring organisation along with\nfellow CDF projects such as Ortelius, Screwdriver, Spinnaker, and Tekton. We believe that being part of the CDF\nGSoC org will create an environment for students with even more mentoring channels, potential cross-fertilization of ideas,\nand an even greater community of DevOps practitioners to join!\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\nGSoC is officially announced, and please expect more students to contact projects in our\nGitter channels and mailing lists.\nMany communications will also happen in SIG and sub-project channels.\nAlso, please join the gsoc channel on the /\">CDF Slack.\nWe will be working hard in order to help students to find interesting projects, to explore the area,\nand to prepare their project proposals before the deadline on April 13th.\nThen we will process the applications, select projects and assign mentor teams.\n\nAll information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its sub-project page.\n\nI am a student. How do I apply?\n\nSee the Information for students page for full application guidelines.\n\nWe encourage interested students to reach out to the Jenkins community early and to start exploring project ideas.\nAll project ideas have chats and mailing lists referenced on their pages.\nWe will be also organizing office hours for students,\nand you can use these meetings to meet org admins and mentors and to ask questions.\nAlso, join our Gitter channel and the\nmailing list\nto receive information about such incoming events in the project.\n\nThe application period starts on March 29th, but you can prepare now!\nUse the time before the application period to discuss and improve your project proposals.\nWe also recommend that you become familiar with Jenkins and start exploring your proposal areas.\nProject ideas include quick-start guidelines and reference newbie-friendly issues\nwhich may help with initial study.\nIf you do not see anything interesting,\nyou can propose your own project idea\nor check out ideas proposed by other CDF organizations\nparticipating in GSoC.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt‚Äôs not!\nWe are looking for more project ideas and for Jenkins contributors/users\nwho are passionate about Jenkins and want to mentor students.\nNo hardcore experience required, mentors can study the project internals together with students and technical advisors.\nWe are especially interested in ideas beyond the Java stack, and in ideas focusing new technologies and areas\n(e.g. Kubernetes, IoT, Python, Go, whatever).\n\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee the Call for Mentors post\nand Information for mentors for details.\nIf you want to propose a new project,\nplease do so as soon as possible so that students have time to explore them and to prepare their proposals.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nTestimonials from former Jenkins GSoC participants ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n\"I participated in Google Summer of Code 2020 in cooperation with the Jenkins organization\nand I work on a project called Windows Service Wrapper, which allows running Jenkins as a service on a Windows machine.\nGSoC was the most wonderful and the most valuable experience I gained during my student life.\nThe whole journey was full of experiences and Jenkins mentors always were there for us.\nI experienced a huge development of my skills while I was working on the project.\nI had many meetings, knowledge sharing sessions, and one pair-coding session with my mentors.\nOne of the best things that I learned is the open-source community and open source mentality.\nIt is not only about taking, but also about giving.\nToday I am maintaining an open-source project which is a simple programming language for kids\nwhich allows them to code in their native language, which will help to learn coding to students in rural areas of my country.\nFinally, Jenkins is a wonderful family and they always were there for us in all the ups and downs.\nI am proud to be a part of the Jenkins community.\"\n\nBuddhika Chathuranga, GSoC 2020 student, Support for YAML Configuration in Windows Service Wrapper\n\n\"My GSoC journey in the Jenkins community starts by a draft proposal full of comments from mentors and ends by two plugins with hundreds of installations.\nAlong with the daily coding review, the weekly meeting and the growth of the project,\nI increased my skills on programming and became a much more eligible engineer.\nWhat is more, the support from the whole Jenkins community leads me to a broader career path.\nI learned how to maintain a project, how to communicate with users and other developers on GitHub.\nMost importantly, the Jenkins community teaches me the principles of the open source world\nand welcomes me to the open source world with all their kind help.\"\n\nKezhi Xiong, GSoC 2020 students, GitHub Checks API project\n\n\"I worked as a Google Summer of Code student with the Jenkins project during the summer of 2019.\nThe project provided me with an excellent opportunity to contribute to the world‚Äôs most popular automation server,\nlearn about building performant and reliable applications, and interact with awesome people around the globe.\nJenkins' ever helpful and extremely knowledgeable community made working on my project a real treat.\nI even got a chance to present my project at DevOps World in Lisbon!\nIf you‚Äôre deciding which organization to work for this year, choose the Jenkins project‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâyou can‚Äôt have a better GSoC experience than this!\"\n\nAbhyudaya Sharma, GSoC 2019 student, Role Strategy Performance Improvements\n\n\"I participated in Google Summer of Code 2018 with Jenkins as a student developer.\nWorking for Jenkins in GSoC 2018 was one of the best experiences I have ever had.\nDuring 3 months of summer, I learned a lot of new things when working on the open-source project with Jenkins.\nAnother best thing about Jenkins is the people, I received a lot of support from my mentors\nand other developers from the Jenkins community when working on my project.\nAfter GSoC, I also had a chance to go to the Jenkins World Conference in San Francisco\nto meet and connect with my mentors and other people in the Jenkins community.\nOverall, GSoC with Jenkins was a great experience and\nI highly recommend Jenkins as a great community to kickstart your open source journey.\"\n\nPham Vu Tuan, GSoC 2018 student, Remoting over Apache Kafka project\n\nImportant dates for GSoC 2021\n\nApr 13 - deadline for student applications\n\nMay 17 - accepted projects announced, teams start community bonding and coding\n\nAug 16 - coding period ends\n\nAug 31 - Results announced\n\nSee the GSoC Timeline for more info.","title":"Jenkins accepted in Google Summer Of Code

the mentor summit and the project retrospectives finished in October,\nnow we can call Google Summer of Code 2020 officially over in the Jenkins community.\nOn behalf of the Jenkins org team, we would like to thank all participants: students, mentors, applicants, and dozens of other contributors who participated in the project this year.\nGoogle Summer of Code would not be successful without the active participation of the Jenkins community.\n\nIf you follow the Jenkins blog, you may have already seen many GSoC 2020 articles created by the project teams.\nHere I would like to focus on the key highlights from the project.\n\nProjects\n\nIn 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.\nWe had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.\nAs usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.\nThe projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes\nneeded for long-term evolution of Jenkins.\n\nHere are the projects we had this year:\n\nCustom Jenkins distribution build service by Sladyn Nunes\n\nExternal Fingerprint Storage by Sumit Sarin\n\nGit Plugin Performance Improvements by Rishabh Budhouliya\n\nGitHub Checks API for Jenkins Plugins by Kezhi Xiong\n\nJenkins X: Apps/Addons consolidation by Zixuan Liu\n\nMachine Learning Plugins for Data Science by Loghi Perinpanayagam\n\nJenkins Windows Services: YAML Configuration Support by Buddhika Chathuranga\n\nPlease refer to the project pages for more information, links to the blog posts, and project demos.\nLet‚Äôs focus on the results instead.\nThis is the first ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.\nIt was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!\n\n.\n\nThanks a lot to all mentors who were guiding students during their projects:\nZhao Xiaojie,\nKristin Whetstone,\nParichay Barpanda,\nMartin d‚ÄôAnjou,\nOleg Nenashev,\nAndrey Falko,\nMike Cirioli,\nMark Waite,\nFrancisco Fernandez,\nJustin Harringa,\nOmkar Deshpande,\nUlli Hafner,\nTim Jacomb,\nKara de la Marck,\nJames Strachan,\nNeha Gupta,\nOscar Medina,\nNikhil Da Rocha,\nSahil Kalra,\nBruno P. Kinoshita,\nIoannis Moutsatsos,\nMarky Jackson,\nShivay Lamba, and\nNext Turn.\n\nGSoC 2020 Org admin team:\nKara de la Marck,\nMartin d‚ÄôAnjou,\nMarky Jackson,\nOleg Nenashev.\n\nEvents\n\nThanks to the GSoC organization stipend from Google and other donations,\nthe Jenkins project usually provides travel grants to successful students so that they can visit a major community event, meet their mentors and community members in person, and present their work there.\nHere are some notes about the GSoC 2019 travel.\nUnfortunately this year it was not possible, and GSoC went completely virtual this year.\n\nOnline meetups\n\nIn August we organized Jenkins Online Meetups where students have presented their projects\n( part 1, part 2).\nYou can find recordings of these presentations in this playlist on the Jenkins YouTube channel.\n\nDevOps World\n\nThis year CloudBees, one of the Jenkins corporate sponsors, invited all students to participate in the DevOps World virtual conference on September 23-25.\nGSoC students did lighting talks about their projects, attended other conference talks, and joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation booth which represented the project at the conference.\nYou can find recordings of the talks and all materials here.\nAlthough the conference was in September, the talks were pre-recorded in early August.\nPlease refer to the Jenkins online meetup recordings for the recent versions.\n\nGSoC Mentor summit\n\nThis is a regular gathering for Google Summer of Code mentors and org admins where they share their experiences about GSoC, outreach programs, community management, and tools.\nUsually it is organized as a multi-day unconference after the end of GSoC, with 2-3 representatives from each project.\nIt has been a great learning experience to participate in it.\nThis year it was a single-day virtual event, and all mentors were able to attend.\nShivay Lamba, one of the GSoC 2020 mentors, also did a lightning talk about the GSoC projects he was working on in Jenkins and CNCF ( slides).\n\nSwag\n\nAll Google Summer of Code students and mentors get swag from Google.\nThis year, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) has sponsored swag for 50 most active GSoC participants:\nall students, mentors, and many other contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.\nThis is the third year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag,\nIn the previous years the swag logistics was one of the most challenging tasks for org admins during the entire project.\nand we highly appreciate help from CDF with this part.\nAs DevOps World presenters, the students have also received special edition speaker swag from CloudBees.\n\nThanks a lot to Google, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) and CloudBees!\n\nRetrospective\n\nAfter completion of the coding phases,\norg admins have reached out to all GSoC 2020 participants to gather their feedback and suggestions.\nWe also recommended that project teams hold their own retrospective meetings.\nSuch information is instrumental to continuously improving GSoC in the Jenkins community.\nWe thank all contributors who shared their feedback!\n\nThe organization-wide retrospective was organized as a survey and a series of retrospective meetings.\nYou can find aggregated results in this Google Doc.\nOverall, we received very positive feedback from students and mentors.\nThe GSoC framework in Jenkins has matured significantly during the previous years.\nThe effort we invested to create guidelines and recommendations for all parties helped a lot because all the expectations were known in advance.\nAs usual, there is much to improve, especially with regards to the community bonding phases and cross-project communications.\nWe are processing the feedback, and we will expand our documentation and the contributor onboarding plans next year.\n\nSome personal notes\n\nI have been involved in leading and coordinating Google Summer of Code in open source projects since 2016.\nThis year I visited the GSoC stand at FOSDEM and met a few organizers and former students.\nA few days after, I proposed participating in GSoC at the Jenkins contributor summit in Brussels,\nand several contributors supported this idea.\nWe spent several hours to create the first Jenkins GSoC page and brainstorm on project ideas.\nWe submitted our application and were accepted.\nThanks a lot to the Google team that gave us a chance!\n\nIt is great to work with the students and see how they explore the open source community and grow professionally as engineers.\nIt is also awesome to see how some of them stay in the project and keep contributing,\nincluding becoming plugin maintainers and GSoC mentors.\nBut, for me, Google Summer of Code is not just about mentoring.\nIt also helps a lot with the community bonding‚Ä¶‚Äã for the existing community like Jenkins which has a lot of isolated sub-communities in plugins.\nMany maintainers work alone, and it can be quite lonely working to maintain a plugin without feedback, developer ideas, and user interactions.\nWhen plugin contributors become project mentors, they join the wider community effort and work in teams.\nIn many cases they start contributing to the organization-wide activities and goals,\nand it grows the \"backbone\" of the Jenkins community.\nLike other community-driven projects, we need such backbone to scale the community and onboard more contributors to the countless Jenkins components.\nSo far it works really well and GSoC excels among outreach programs in this regard.\n\nI would like to thank the Google Open Source team, students and all Jenkins community members for the great Google Summer of Code this year.\nWe also thank the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help to recognize contributors and allow organization administrators to focus on projects.\nLast but not least, I would like to thank the Jenkins org admin team:\nMartin d‚ÄôAnjou,\nMarky Jackson, and\nKara de la Marck.\nThis was a crazy year for everyone. Regardless of that, the org admins stepped up and took responsibility for students and mentors involved in the project, with a serious time commitment.\nNot all work by the organizers is publicly visible (applications, project selection, resolving conflicts),\nbut this work is essential to the project‚Äôs success.\nThanks a lot to org admins and mentors who helped with the administrative tasks this year!\n\nWhat‚Äôs about GSoC 2021?\n\nYes, we plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021.\nThe application period for organizations will start in a few months,\nbut we have already started preparing for the next GSoC session.\nWe are looking for mentors, org admins and project ideas.\nPlease contact us if you are interested!\n\nCall for Mentors and Project Ideas\n\nGSoC 2021 project ideas\n\nHOWTO: Propose a project idea\n\nInformation for mentors : guidelines and expectations\n\nWe invite potential students to start exploring the project and the available project ideas.\nOriginal ideas are always welcome in the project, and starting early is a great opportunity to\nget introduced to the Jenkins community, collect more information about the problem areas,\nand to create a good proposal.\n\"Start early\" is the most popular recommendation from GSoC 2020 participants to future GSoC students,\nand we encourage you to follow this advice!","title":"Google Summer of Code 2020 summary","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2020","jenkins","community","events","mentor"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/oleg_nenashev.png"},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"events","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":5,"currentPage":1}},
