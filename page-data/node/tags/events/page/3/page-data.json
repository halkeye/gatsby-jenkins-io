The Jenkins Contributor Summit is the place where\ncurrent and future contributors get together to discuss, learn and collaborate on the latest and greatest efforts within\nJenkins project. The morning portion of the summit is a mix of presentations by the core contributors. The\npresentations highlight what each effort is about and what community members can do to help. In the\nafternoon breakout sessions with  Birds of a Feather tables for in-depth discussion, and collaboration with sub-project\ncontributors.\n\nI feel very honored to have been a part of this.\n\nDay 1\n\nDay one started with the contributor summit. This was a chance for everyone to get together and talk about\ncontributions and put faces to names. Most people I had only met via video chat or on gitter so I was super excited.\nWe gathered to hear about the start of the Jenkins open source landscape.\n\nNext up was the BoF/Unconference. I was leading these sessions and I felt they went really well.\nWe had fellow org admins Martin d’Anjou and Jeff Pearce give a talk about Google Summer of Code projects.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code student Natasha Stopa presented her project, Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool. This is\na super cool project and very well received in the community.\n\nWe closed out the session with a presentation from Steven Terrana from Booz Allen Hamilton and the awesome Jenkins\nTemplating Engine. If you have not had a chance to try this, please make sure you do at https://github.com/boozallen/jenkins-templating-engine.\n\nMain Expo Hall\n\nDay two and onward saw me and other Jenkins org admins in the Ask the Expert booth for the Jenkins community.\n\nThis was a really cool experience and gave me a chance to hear about things the community is working on and help with\nissues they are facing.\nThere were a range of questions from Jenkins X to many of the plugins I maintain such and the Jenkins Prometheus and the\nSysdig Secure Scanning plugins.\nThere were also a lot of Kubernetes questions. There is a lot of marketing data regarding the increased usage of\nKubernetes but I was seriously surprised by the massive interest in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nOf course there were opportunities for selfie requests.\n\nLunch time demos got underway and we had a busy schedule.\nFirst up was the awesome Mark Waite to talk about the\nGit plugin. A lot of people use git in\nJenkins.\nThank you so much for all that you do Mark.\n\nJenkins org admin Martin d’Anjou was next on deck to talk about the Google Summer of Code. So amazing to think that the\nGoogle Summer of Code is also in its 15th year like Jenkins!\n\nNatasha Stopa is a Google Summer of Code student and she presented her project Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool.\nNatasha really put a lot of hard work in to this plugin and it was really awesome to see the turn out and support during\nher presentation.\n\nFinally there was me. I presented the Sysdig Secure Scanning Jenkins plugin which I am a maintainer of. I thank everyone who attended\n\nRight after the lunch time demos I also oversaw the Jenkins open space. This was an opportunity for the community to talk\nabout items and let them flow organically. I really enjoyed this session and felt it was also well received.\n\nWe closed out the day and the event with a picture of some of the Jenkins org admins and Google Summer of Code students.\nMissing from this photos are fellow org admins, Lloyd Chang and Oleg Nenashev\n\nClosing\n\nThis was an amazing experience. Huge thanks to CloudBees, the Jenkins community, Google Summer of Code, Tracy Miranda,\nAlyssa Tong and my employer Sysdig.\n\nTo think Jenkins is 15 years old is amazing! There has been so much accomplished and the future is so bright. I am so\nthankful for the opportunity to serve and be a part of the open source community.\nHere’s to 15 more years all!\n\nIf you are interested in joining any one of the Jenkins open source special interest groups, look here.

It was\nan amazing experience getting to meet people from all over world who are trying\nto make the development and release process easier and more efficient. I enjoyed\nlearning more about industry tools, processes, and standards, and meeting CI/CD\nexperts and contributors in the open source community.\n\nBelow is a summary of my experience. Thank you to the Jenkins project and CloudBees for making\n my trip and attendance possible!\n\nDay 1\n\nMonday was the Continuous Delivery Contributor Summit, which focused on projects\nunder the CDF umbrella.  After checking in and grabbing my badge, I was able to\nmeet up with some of the Google Summer of Code org admins. It was great\nbeing able to actually meet them in person after talking to them over video\nconferencing and chats all summer!\n\nTracy Miranda started the summit out by introducing the Continuous Delivery Foundation,\nwhich aims to provide a vendor neutral home to help and sustain open source projects\nfocusing on all aspects of continuous delivery.  Currently, Jenkins, Tekton, Spinnaker,\nand JenkinsX have joined the foundation.  Project updates were given for Jenkins,\nTekton, and JenkinsX.  In the afternoon, attendees split into different groups for\nunconference sessions.  I presented my project to the Jenkins group.  Afterwards,\nthere was free time to chat with other attendees about my project and the other Jenkins\nprojects. Lastly, lightning talks were given before everyone headed to the contributor\nappreciation event to grab some food and drinks.\n\nDay 2\n\nI attended the Jenkins Pipeline Fundamentals Short Course in the morning. Even\nthough I’m working on a project for Jenkins, there’s still a lot I don’t know so\nI just wanted to try to learn more.\n\nA lot of the afternoon sessions filled up, so I spent the afternoon trying to meet\nother people at the conference, before heading to the keynote. The keynote\ntalked more about the CDF and some of the backstory behind its origin.  This year is also a big anniversary for Jenkins - it has now been\naround for 15 years.\n\nAfter the keynote, I checked out a Women in Tech mixer and\nthe opening of the exibition hall. Probably my favorite swag I picked up was the\n\"Will Code for Beer\" stickers and a bottle of hot sauce.\n\nDay 3\n\nThe morning began with another keynote. Shawn Ahmed of CloudBees talked about the\nchallenges of visibility into bottlenecks of the development process and Rajeev Mahajan\ndiscussed how HSBC tackled DevOps.  The rest of the day I attended different sessions\non container tooling, implementing CI/CD in a cloud native environment, running\nJenkins on Jenkins, and database DevOps.\n\nAfter the sessions finished, I wandered\naround the expo until it closed, then joined some of the other conference attendees\nto have some fun at a ping pong bar nearby.\n\nDay 4\n\nThe final and last day of the conference was probably my favorite.  The morning\nkeynote revealed that Zhao Xiaojie had won an award for his work on Jenkins advocacy,\nsome other DevOps award panelists talked about their approaches to different challenges,\nthen David Stanke gave an enjoyable presentation about cloud native CI/CD. I was\nable to present my summer project and attend a few more sessions, including one\nabout DevOps at scale, and another about use cases for machine learning in CI/CD pipelines.\n\nThe last keynote given by James Governor was a thoughtful look into the current and\nfuture states of tech. How does tech look like it will scale in the coming years\nin the U.S. and across the world? How can we make tech more inclusive and accessible?\nWhat can we do to minimize our environmental footprint?  In particular, his points\non welcoming people from a non-traditional computer science background resonated with\nme since I’m currently undergoing my own career transition to tech.\n\nAfter the conference ended, I said goodbye to the remaining GSoC org admins before\nmeeting an old friend for dinner and bringing along some new friends I met at the\nconference.  I spent the remaining part of the night singing karaoke with\nthem before heading out of San Francisco the next morning.\n\nThanks again to everyone who supported me and encouraged me leading up to and during\nmy presentation, patiently answered my questions as I tried to gather more context\nabout CI/CD tools and practices, and made my first DevOps conference so enjoyable!","title":"My DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 Experience","tags":["pluginmanagement","devopsworld2019","gsoc","gsoc2019","community","events"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#280818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/405b9/stopalopa.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7b6be/stopalopa.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/ebcfb/stopalopa.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/0ade5/stopalopa.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/5b0b1/stopalopa.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/96834/stopalopa.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/805f6/stopalopa.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":184}}},"blog":null,"github":"stopalopa","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Natasha is a Master&#8217;s student at Penn State University.

The Mentor Summit is an unconference\nwhere participants are invited to fill empty time slots with their own topic of discussion.\n\nFriday Oct 12\n\nPre-conference meeting\n\nThe mentors had a short pre-conference meeting to reflect on the Jenkins participation in the 2018 GSoC program,\nand to plan for 2019.\nWe were joined at this meeting by Lloyd Chang, whom we had met at Jenkins World 2018.\nThank you Lloyd for joining us! A few ideas we had for 2019 are:\n\nMove project proposals to individual Google Documents\n\nCreate a template for project proposed by potential mentors and by project champions\n\nCreate an Organization Administrator Guide for future Jenkins GSoC project admins\n\nOther preparations we agreed to work on include a review of the 2018 feedback and the creation\nof an Epic capturing the action items in preparation for 2019.\nWe are also planning on making progress on the GSoC Budget process described in JEP-8.\n\nSummit Starts!\n\nThe summit started by a welcoming dinner at the Google Cafeteria and an evening session\nwhere we were explained how the unconference would work. We proposed a few topics:\ndealing with CPT lost slots, motivating mentors, and Open Source Hardware ASIC/FPGA.\n\nOn thing to say is that everyone at the conference had heard of Jenkins, or was already using Jenkins.\nLots of people came to tell us their Jenkins experience.\n\nI noticed this too - made me feel proud to be part of the Jenkins project.\n\n— Jeff Pearce\nJenkins GSoC mentor in 2018\n\nSaturday Oct 13\n\nThe morning started with a couple of announcements from Google.\nThe first one was that Google is thinking of creating a program called \"Google Season of Docs\" (GSoD for short),\nwhere technical writers would be paired with Open Source Organizations to help them write documentation such as:\n\nHigh-impact tutorials\n\nSet of How-To Guides\n\nContributor’s Guide\n\nDocumentation refactoring\n\nPlain documentation\n\nWe have additional details regarding this in the\nGSoC Mentor Summit Notes\nand we quickly concluded that if this program comes to life, Jenkins should be a participating organization.\n\nThe other announcement made by the GSoC administrators is that GSoC may take a different form in 2020.\nHowever, not much more information has been made available at this time.\nThe program has been operating for 13 years, and in 2020 it will have been 15 years.\n\nThe announcements were followed by a series of morning lightning talks.\nThis is where organizations showcase what their students accomplished during the program.\nThis is when we had a bit of a surprise…​\n\nOleg who had signed up for the evening lightning talks, was watching the talks while casually preparing slides for his evening presentation.\nBut something unusual happened: many talks were shorter than the 3-minute allotted, and suddenly we were ahead of schedule.\nThat’s when Oleg was called to the stage.\nI had no idea whether his slides were ready or not since he had just leaned over to me to say that he wanted to talk about all 3 projects we had this year.\nNot knowing how far he had gotten into refactoring the slides, this was going to be…​ interesting.\nBeing an experienced presenter, Oleg pulled it off brilliantly.\nThe slides were effectively ready (how he managed that I have no idea),\nbut you can see the slides of his lightning talk here:\nJenkins Remoting over Apache Kafka.\n\nThen there were the unconference sessions. Some of the sessions we attended are:\n\nDocumentation\n\nAttracting and retaining mentors (facilitated by Martin)\n\nOrganizing and motivating volunteers and mentors\n\nGetting students from coding/boot camps involved in open source\n\nRetaining students after GSoC\n\nOpen Event management System\n\nGSoC Feedback\n\nWe have notes for all the session in the main document.\nSome sessions were captured in separated documents which are linked from the main document, or from this blog post.\n\nThere were lots of good ideas in those sessions, and we will do what we can next year to implement some of them.\n\nSome organizations have said that the key for student retention\nis to give them responsibilities and tasks after the program is over.\nWe have certainly seen that this year, with one of our students asking for more responsibilities and wanting to know how\nhis plugin project could continue to grow within the Jenkins project (while at the same time help out on another GSoC plugin!).\n\nIn the evening was the second round of lightning talks.\nJeff Pearce presented the Code Coverage API Plugin lightning talk,\n(he was not caught by surprise).\n\nAfter the lightning talks, we were invited to hang out at the cafeteria and on the patio, to exchange stickers,\nnetwork with mentors of other organizations, and enjoy late evening snacks, music and of course the chocolate table!\n\nSunday Oct 14\n\nOn Sunday, the sessions continued. An interesting session was \"Beyond GSoC, What can Google do?\".\nOne person got a big round of applause when he said: \"Cloud credits\". It turns out the GSoC program admins\nhave been trying to get that for us for about 3 years. Google may be big and powerful, but some things\nare hard and remain hard in the corporate world.\n\nAn interesting suggestion was made by Oleg, and it would be to have a program with smaller, shorter term\ncommitments, something that would encourage more granular contributions but would not require a 4-month\nlong commitment. This was noted by the GSoC program admins.\n\nThen we attended a number of sessions:\n\nOpen Hardware ASIC/FPGA (facilitated by Martin)\n\nCommunity Metrics\n\nOutreachy (Jenkins is participating in this program)\n\nFailing a student\n\nBurnout (of mentors and org admins)\n\nThen the day came to an end with some last words by Google thanking all the mentors and volunteers who\nrun this program in their organizations.\n\nReturn trip\n\nI would now like to add a personal note. After the summit, like many others I fly back home,\nso I spend the evening at the SFO international terminal waiting for my late night flight.\nThat is where I get to meet more mentors, as some of us still wear our badges and T-Shirts,\nand also recognize each other from being at the conference.\nAnd funny enough, there are so many geeks at that terminal\nthat we may have recruited, among the passengers, a mentor to another org for next year!\n\nWant a GSoC student to work on your project in 2019?\n\nWe have already started the preparations for GSoC 2019.\nAnd we cannot do this without the participation of the Jenkins community.\nWe are already looking for:\n\nMentors from the Jenkins Special Interest Groups\n\nMentors from any background and any provenance (being a Jenkins developer is NOT required)\n\nProject proposals\n\nStudents and their proposals\n\nLots of people are afraid that mentoring a student will take a lot of their time.\nIf you feel that way, you are not alone. It does take some time. In my case, I spend 5 to 8 hours per week on mentor tasks (more at the start, less at the end).\nTo make it easier on mentors who likely have full time jobs and life commitments, we define different mentor roles:\n\nProject champion co-mentor : this is the mentor who proposes the idea, but may not have all the Jenkins code expertise needed. This mentor works with the student to define the project and acts mostly as a \"customer\" of the project. This mentor usually know enough about coding to comment on pull-requests with regards to the over quality, style and features of the code.\n\nTechnical co-mentor : this is the mentor who knows enough about the Jenkins code to guide the student on coding, and to provide Jenkins specific code reviews on pull-requests, but has limited involvement outside the coding activity of the student.\n\nThere is a third role which is:\n\nSubject Matter Expert : these individuals are not mentors, but we reach out to them 3-4 times during the project for advice and guidance, and sometimes complicated programming challenges.\n\nIf you have questions or are curious about the program,\ncontact us on the GSoC Gitter SIG chat.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that project proposals are not limited to \"big projects\".\nFor example, it is perfectly fine to have a proposal that is a collection of related Jira issues that aim to improve your project,\nor a list of tasks that need to be done for your project.\nWriting documentation is outside the scope of GSoC, but automating\ndocumentation generation, as long as it is mostly about writing code, is within the scope of GSoC.\n\nWe look forward working with the Jenkins community on GSoC 2019!","title":"Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit 2018","tags":["community","events","gsoc","gsoc2018"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#7898d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/7b80f/martinda.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/4c2a5/martinda.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/8bef2/martinda.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/7b80f/martinda.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/2864c/martinda.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/5abcf/martinda.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/410d2/martinda.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/6f814/martinda.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/ca864/martinda.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":136}}},"blog":null,"github":"martinda","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Martin is a Jenkins community member.

Jenkins World conference and the contributor summit.\n\nCode Coverage API Plugin\n\nStudent: Shenyu Zheng, Henan University, China\n\nMentors:\nJeff Pearce,\nSteven Christou,\nOleg Nenashev,\nSupun Wanniarachchi\n\nProject page\n\nThere are many code coverage plugins in Jenkins: Cobertura, JaCoCo, Emma, etc., etc.\nThe problem with these plugins is that each of them implements all code coverage features on their own.\nSo you get different feature sets, UIs, CLI commands and REST APIs.\nThe idea of this project was to unify the existing functionality and offer a new API plugin which other plugins could extend.\nIt would help to simplify existing plugin and to create new plugins for coverage tools.\n\nThe project has started really well, and we had the first demo after a week of coding.\nThen Shenyu continued extending the plugin’s functionality over coding periods.\nHere is the list of the key features offered by the plugin:\n\nFlexible data structure for defining and storing coverage metrics within Jenkins\n\nCoverage charts and trends\n\nSource code navigation\n\nREST API for retrieving coverage stats and trends\n\nReport aggregation for parallel steps\n\nExtension points which allow integrating other plugins\n\nIn addition to the Code Coverage API Plugin,\nShenyu added integration to the Cobertura Plugin and also created a new llvm-cov plugin which is expected to be released soon.\n\nAfter GSoC Shenyu continued contributing to the Jenkins project.\nHe works on the Code Coverage API plugin and also participates in the Chinese Localization SIG.\n\nSimple Pull-Request Job Plugin\n\nStudent: Abhishek Gautam, Visvesvaraya National Institute of technology, India\n\nMentors:\nMartin d’Anjou,\nJeff Knurek,\nKristin Whetstone\n\nProject page\n\nThis project focused on introducing a way to\neasily define pull-request build job definitions in YAML.\nThis project has been shaped a lot during the application period and community bonding,\nso that the project fit the existing Jenkins Ecosystem better.\nFinally it was decided to build the new plugin on the top of Pipeline: Multi-Branch Plugin.\nThere was also an idea to offer extra syntax sugar, templating and automatic resolution for common flows,\nso that users need less time to define Pipelines for common use-cases.\n\nThe plugin allows defining Pipeline jobs as YAML being stored in SCM.\nOriginal design presumed a new job type,\nbut during community bonding and Phase 1 prototyping it was decided to build the plugin on the top of the existing Pipeline ecosystem and extension points.\nCurrently the plugin generates Declarative Pipeline code from YAML so that it gets a lot of Pipeline features out-of-the box.\nIn addition to that, Simple Pull Request Job Plugin uses a an engine provided by the Configuration as Code plugin to convert YAML snippets\nto Pipeline step definitions.\n\nThe plugin has been well described by Abhishek in his Pipeline as YAML blogpost in August.\nCurrently it is available in the Experimental Update Center as an alpha version.\nPham Vu Tuan, one of our GSoC students, have also joined the plugin team.\nAt the DevOps World - Jenkins World hackfest we had discussions with the Jenkins Pipeline team,\nand we have a plan towards making this plugin available as an Incubated Pipeline project.\nThe final implementation may change,\nbut in any case the project gave us a working prototype and a lot of information about  obstacles we need to resolve.\n\nRemoting over Apache Kafka\n\nStudent: Pham Vu Tuan, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore\n\nMentors:\nOleg Nenashev,\nSupun Wanniarachchi\n\nProject page\n\nLast but not least, Remoting over Kafka is another challenging project we had.\nTo implement communication between its controllers and agents, Jenkins widely uses home-grown protocol implementations based on TCP\n( JNLP 1..4 protocols).\nThere are some performance and stability implementations,\nand there have been discussions about using an industry-standard message bus or queue.\nPham Vu Tuan proposed to use Apache Kafka for it,\nand after some experiments during community bonding and first coding phase we agreed to go forward with this implementation.\n\nDuring his project Vu Tuan extended Jenkins Core and Remoting to allow implementing an agent communication channel in a plugin.\nThen he has created a new Remoting over Kafka plugin\nwhich is now available in the main Jenkins Update cente.\nOnce the plugin is installed, it is possible to connect to agents over Apache Kafka and execute all types of Jenkins jobs there.\nThere are also official jenkins/remoting-kafka-agent images available on DockerHub.\n\nVu Tuan continued contributing to the Jenkins project after GSoC, currently he maintains the Remoting over Kafka plugin.\nHe visited the DevOps World - Jenkins World US conference in September, presented his GSoC project at the\nJenkins Contributor Summit.\nYou can find his slides here.\nAfter the conference he also participated in the hackfest where he helped to migrate Jenkins' DNS services to Microsoft Azure.\n\nWhat could we do better?\n\nAfter the end of GSoC we had a Retrospective with GSoC students and mentors.\nWe discussed the issues we encountered during the projects,\nand ways to improve the student and mentor experience.\n\nMain takeaways for us:\n\nGSoC projects should be aligned with Jenkins Special Interest Groups (SIGs) or subprojects in order to get a wider list of stakeholders\nProjects should be aligned with SIG priorities when possible\n\nIn addition to GSoC SIG meetings and Jenkins Online Meetups during student evaluation,\nwe should also run regular status updates within SIGs so that there more contributors involved in projects\n\nWe should invest more time into forming mentor teams before the application period starts.\nThis year there were changes in mentor teams after the community bonding started, and it complicated the work\n\nWe should pay more attention to student eligibility.\nThis year we started from 4 projects, but unfortunately one project (EDA plugins for Jenkins) got cancelled due to the visa limitations the student had.\n\nWe should do regular office hours for mentors/students so that it is possible to exchange information between GSoC projects within the organization.\nThis year we cancelled them at the end of phase and relied only on regular project meetings and mailing lists, but this is not enough.\n\nFor me personally the main takeaway is also to reduce direct involvement into the project as a mentor and technical advisor.\nDoing org administration, logistics and mentorship is not good from a bus factor PoV,\nand I believe I was pushing my vision too hard in few cases.\nWill do my best to prevent it next year.\n\nIf you want to share your feedback and ideas,\nplease reach out to us using the GSoC mailing list.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn order to improve GSoC organization in Jenkins,\nwe have have created a GSoC Special Interest Group which will be running non-stop as other SIGs in Jenkins.\nThe objective of the SIG is to organize GSoC, work with potential students/mentors,\nand to help students stay involved in the community after GSoC ends.\nIn this SIG we will have monthly meetings to sync-up on GSoC.\nIf you are interested to contribute, please join the SIG.\n\nAccording to the Retrospective, next year we plan to invest more\ninto communication with mentors.\nWe will also try to tie new project proposals to Jenkins\nSpecial Interest Groups so that the students become a part\nof ongoing coordinated efforts.\nThis weekend Martin d’Anjou, Jeff Pearce and me are participating in the GSoC Mentor summit to share experiences and to study from other GSoC organizations.\nOn October 17 we will have a GSoC SIG meeting to discuss our experience and to discuss next steps.\n\nIn addition to that,\nJenkins Google Summer of Code will be presented at DevOps World - Jenkins World Nice and at the contributor summit.\nIf you plan to visit the conference and you are interested to participate in Google Summer of Code and other community activities,\nplease join us at the contributor summit or stop by at the community booth.\n\nAnd, elephant in the room…​ GSoC 2019.\nOf course we are going to apply, stay tuned for new announcements.\nWe have already started collecting project ideas for the next year.\nIf you are interested to participate as a student or mentor,\nplease reach out to us using the GSoC SIG mailing list.","title":"Jenkins in Google Summer of Code 2018 Results","tags":["community","events","gsoc","gsoc2018"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"events","limit":8,"skip":16,"numPages":5,"currentPage":3}},
