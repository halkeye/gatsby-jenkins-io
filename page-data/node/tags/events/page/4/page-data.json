week I participated in the\nJenkins & Java 10 Online Hackathon.\nIt was my first Jenkins hackathon and I roped in\nJonah Graham to do some pair-programming.\nThe hackathon featured JDK Project Jigsaw committers Mandy Chung and Paul Sandoz,\nas well as Jenkins creator Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\nIt was a great opportunity for me to learn a lot about Jenkins and Java 10.\n\nWhy Java 10?\n\nWith the\nJava 8 EoL data looming,\nthe focus was on the current available version of Java, Java 10.\nJava 10 offers some nice new features and APIs, not least\nimproved docker container integration.\nWe learned from Paul of a number of projects with Java 10 migration success stories including Elasticsearch, Kafka & Netty.\n\nAt the beginning of the hackathon week, the Jenkins Pipeline feature would crash out when using Java 10.\nThis was resolved with a number of fixes including the upgrade of the\nASM library.\nThen it was nice to see things\nup and running with Java 10.\n\nGetting up & running\n\nThe first steps were to do some exploratory testing using\nJenkins with Java 10 via Docker, thanks to\nOleg for providing clear instructions.\nThis was boringly straightforward as most things worked and we only found one\nissue to report.\nNext to try to get some patches in, we needed to set-up a dev environment.\nThe live session gave us what we needed to set up a\nplugin or\ncore dev environment.\nOne open question we had was whether Jenkins has semantic versioning and\nAPI tools\nto help identify when you might be breaking backwards compatibility.\nOverall it was straightforward to get a dev environment up and running.\n\nJava 10 New APIs\n\nThe next step was to find an issue which we could help resolve.\nMany of the Java 10 issues were related to 'Illegal reflective access' from various plugins or third-party libraries.\nHowever after investigating a couple, removing these warnings required a good architectural knowledge of the plugin or core code itself.\nIn the end we decided that messing around with classloaders or attempting to upgrade version of jdom was not one for the newbies.\n\nInstead we looked at\nremoving reflection\nin cases of isAccessible calls.\nWe found the\nProcessHandle\napi very useful and a good replacement for some misuse of reflection, and even better it made the code work on Windows too.\nMandy also pointed us to look at the\nLookup api\nas possible alternate to findClass calls.\n\nMulti-Release JAR Builds\n\nUsing new APIs is all well and good but presents a problem when you want to maintain backwards compatibility with Java 8.\nHence the need for some sort of multi-jar solution -\nNicolas De loof proposed one such solution for\nmulti-release jars with Maven for this case.\n\nsun.misc.Signal\n\nThe Java Signal API is being deprecated, but so far no replacement APIs\nare available for signal handling.\nJenkins makes use of the Signal APIs so a big question for the Jigsaw team was whether this would be replaced going forward.\nKohsuke pointed out how it is important for Java to maintain this UNIX like behaviour as it shouldn’t matter to end users that Jenkins is written in Java.\nIt seems these APIs will be replaced in due course, they just\naren’t there right now.\n\nCollaboration, Collaboration, Collaboration\n\nIt was great to have the discussions with the Jigsaw team.\nThey reminded us how they need to know the Java use cases out there and how their team uses these to feed into their development process.\nIn turn, the hackathon had Jenkins community members participate, for instance\neasy-jenkins was up and running with Java 10 by the end of the week.\nThe hackathon had a great feeling of community spirit and was a reminder why collaborations with communities and also between different communities can be powerful and fun for all involved.\n\nAt the end of the week Jonah and I were both happy that we made our first Jenkins contributions (which were reviewed and merged quickly).\nThanks to all who participated and made it highly enjoyable, especially Oleg for great organization.\nI look forward to the next one!","title":"What I learned from the Jenkins & Java 10+

week we have a\nJenkins & Java 10 Online Hackathon.\nThis is an open online event, where we work together on Jenkins core and plugins in order\nto find and fix compatibility issues, share experiences and have some fun.\nEverybody is welcome to join, independently of their Jenkins experience and amount of time they have available.\n\nAfter the kick off on Monday\nJenkins contributors have been working on Java 10 and Java 11 support in Jenkins.\nWe have already received contributions from 12 hackathon participants, and the number keeps growing.\nThere are still 3 days ahead, but we have already achieved some important results we want to share.\n\nJenkins Pipeline\n\nOne of our major efforts over last 2 days was to get Jenkins Pipeline working on\nJava 10+.\nWhen the hackathon started Jenkins Pipeline was not working at all,\nand it was a major blocker for Java support and for exploratory testing in particular.\nWe’ve been working together with Sam van Oort and Devin Nusbaum to fix the libraries in\nthe Jenkins core, Pipeline: Support plugin and Docker packaging.\n\nJust to summarize the result of two days in one screenshot…​\n\nYes, we have got it running!\nOver two days we have got from the \"Pipeline Crashes Immediately\"\nstate to the situation when the most of key Pipeline features are operational,\nincluding Scripted and Declarative Pipeline, Blue Ocean, shared libraries and\ndozens of plugins being used in the Jenkins plugin build flow.\n\nThere is still a lot of work to do to get the changes finalized,\nbut Jenkins Pipeline is available for testing on Java 10 and 11 now.\nIf you want to try it out, you can use a new jenkins/jenkins-experimental:blueocean-jdk10\nimage we have created.\nIt bundles all the required patches, so you can just run the following command to get started:\n\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins-experimental:blueocean-jdk10\n\nIf you want to try more complex scenarions, see the\nRunning Jenkins with Java 10 and 11 blogpost\nand List of Required patches.\n\nWhat else?\n\nAlthough Pipeline is the most visible change,\nthere are other ongoing activities:\n\nDevin Nusbaum explored plugin startup issues we had with JDK 11ea+17\nand confirmed that we need to upgrade our images to JDK 11ea+18\n\nGianpaolo Macario is working on adopting the Java 10 experimental images in his\neasy-jenkins project\n\nSam van Oort and Devin Nusbaum are working on getting plugin build and test flows\nwhen using JDK 10 with Maven\n\nNicolas de Loof is working on cleaning up Illegal reflective access warnings in Jenkins components,\nusing the new Fields micro-library\n\nOlivier Lamy and Nicolas de Loof are updating the\nAnimal Sniffer plugin for Maven\nto make it compatible with Java 9 and above\n\nKohsuke Kawaguchi has released a repackaged version of ASM 6.2 we use in the project\n\nLast but not least, Liam Newman and Tracy Miranda helped us a lot to run the meetings\nand to get this hackathon organized\n\nThere are also other contributors working on exploratory testing and reporting\ndefects they discover.\nSee our status doc\nfor the full list.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTomorrow we will have 2 sessions:\n\nAt 8AM UTC we will have a sync-up.\nAccording to the requests from hackathon paticipants, we will have an intro session to Jenkins development for newcomers\n\nYouTube link\n\nAt 4PM UTC we will have a meeting with key JDK Project Jigsaw committers\n\nMark Reinhold, Mandy Chung and Paul Sandoz will join us to talk about\nJava 10/11 adoption\n\nYouTube link\n\nWe will also post participant links in our Gitter channel\n15 minutes before the meetings.\nIf you have any questions, please join the meetings or raise questions in the chat during the call.\n\nCan I still join the hackathon?\n\nYes, you can!\nIt is possible to hop in and hop off at any time.\nJust respond to the registration form,\njoin our Gitter channel and start hacking/testing.\n\nWe also have a number of\nnewbie-friendly issues\nyou can start from.\nSee our Kick-off session and\nslides for quick start guidelines.\n\nLinks\n\nDeveloper mailing list\n\nHackathon sync-up

behalf of the Jenkins Events Team,\nI would like to invite you to the “Jenkins & Java 10 Online Hackathon” which will take place from June 18th to 22nd.\nWe will be working together on Jenkins core and plugins in order\nto find and fix compatibility issues, share experiences and have some fun.\nEverybody is welcome to join, independently of their Jenkins experience and amount of time they have available.\n\nIf you are interested in participating in the hackathon, please sign-up in\nthis form.\n\nBackground\n\nJava 9 has recently been end-of-lifed, Java 10 is in GA, and Java 11 is in early beta.\nJenkins project currently requires Java 8 to run reliably,\nand there are some known compatibility issues with higher Java versions.\n\nDuring the Jenkins World 2017 Hackathon,\nMark Waite and\nBaptiste Mathus spent some time exploring Java 9 compatibility in Jenkins.\nWe are currently tracking compatibility issues in the\nJENKINS-40689 EPIC,\nbut there are likely many unknown issues in Jenkins core, plugins and in libraries we use in the project.\nWe would like to continue their effort and work on Java 10+ support.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nAs I have said above,\nthe goals are to explore/fix compatibility issues, share experiences and have fun.\nWe DO NOT plan to make Jenkins fully compatible with Java 10+\nduring the hackathon,\nbut we will try to integrate fixes and make them available.\n\nSince the announcement of the Hackathon in the mailing list,\nwe have got a number of registrations from contributors working on several project areas.\nWe will split our work to several areas:\n\nJenkins core and Remoting\n\nPipeline Engine\n\nPlugins (e.g. Git plugin or any plugin you want to work on)\n\nExploratory testing for Java 10 and beyond\n\nIn order to organize the effort, we have created a\njava10_hackathon label\nin Jenkins JIRA.\nIf you are interested in particular tasks,\nplease assign them to yourself and add the label.\n\nOrganization\n\nCurrently the event is in the planning stage.\nWe will be using the Developer mailing list\nfor synchronization before the event.\n\nWhat will we have?\n\nCommunications in #jenkins-hackhouse IRC and in the\nJenkins Gitter channel\n\nDaily recorded sync-up calls in Hangouts\n\nKnowledge transfer sessions during the event\n\nWe also want to prepare some special swag for active participants.\nIf you have reached this part of the blogpost,\nyou have probably seen the logo ;)\n\nLinks\n\nRegistration\n\nDeveloper mailing list\n\nHackathon sync-up document\n\nRunning Jenkins with Java 10 and

are happy to announce that Jenkins project has been accepted to\nGoogle Summer of Code 2018.\nThis year we invite students and mentors to join the Jenkins community and work together\non various initiatives: core, plugins, development tools and infrastructure.\n\nOur mentors have already created some project ideas.\nFor example, you are welcome to work on the new Configuration-as-Code initiative or\nto help creating standard API for Code Coverage plugins.\nIf you like test automation, there is a proposal to\nJenkins Acceptance Test Harness.\nOver the next weeks we plan to extend this list by new even more project ideas.\n\nAll information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its subproject page.\n\nI am a student. How do I apply?\n\nSee Information for students for application guidelines.\n\nFirst step is to join discussions in the mailing lists in order to introduce yourself, establish connections with the community and potential mentors.\nThe application period starts on March 12 and ends on March 27, but don’t let it misguide you!\nUse time before application to discuss project ideas/proposals with mentors and to process their feedback.\nTo create a better proposal, we also recommend to study Jenkins and to do some contributions in the area of your project proposal.\n\nNot satisfied by the current project ideas?\nYou can propose your own idea\nin the developer mailing list.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt’s not!\nIf you are passionate about open-source and Jenkins, we invite you to join the mentors team.\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee Call for Mentors and Information for mentors for details.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nImportant dates\n\nMar 05 - deadline for new GSoC project idea proposals\n\nMar 12 - student application period starts\n\nMar 27 - deadline for student applications\n\nApr 23 - accepted projects announced, community bonding starts\n\nMay 14 - coding period starts\n\nAug 06 - end of the coding period\n\nSee the GSoC Timeline for more info.\nIn the Jenkins project we will also organize special events during and after GSoC (e.g. at Jenkins world).\n\nP.S: I am going to create a special GSoC 2018 edition of swags for mentors and students.
