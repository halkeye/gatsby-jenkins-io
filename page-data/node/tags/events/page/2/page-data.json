We make sure that every project has at least two mentors.\nGSoC org admins will help to find technical advisers, so you can study together with your students.\n\nMentoring takes about 5 to 8 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).\nMentors provide guidance, coaching, and sometimes a bit of cheerleading.\nThey review student proposals, pull-requests and the students presentations\nat the evaluation phase.\nThey fill in the Google provided evaluation report form at the end of coding periods.\n\nWhat do you get in exchange?\n\nIn return of mentoring, a student works on your project full time for three months.\nThink about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but never had the time…​\n\nMentoring is also an opportunity to improve your management and people skills, while giving back to the community.\n\nThere will be a Google Mentor Summit which takes place every year.\nIn 2020, the Mentor Summit was virtual, but in previous years the summit has taken place in person.\n\nSee this post\nabout the 2019 in person Mentor Summit.\n\nGSoC is a fantastic program and the Jenkins project is happy to participate in GSoC again in 2021!\n\nFor any question, you can find the GSoC Org Admins,\nmentors and participants on the GSoC SIG Gitter chat.","title":"Google Summer of Code 2021 call for Project Ideas and Mentors","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2021","community","events","developer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#082848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/0e311/marckk.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/6105b/marckk.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/11755/marckk.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/0e311/marckk.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/b2ade/marckk.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/a4758/marckk.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/47694/marckk.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/bf0f6/marckk.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/445f6/marckk.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":116.99999999999999}}},"blog":null,"github":"MarckK","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Ecosystem Advocate at the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).\nCo-chair of the Continuous Delivery Foundation’s Interoperability SIG and a mentor and org admin for Outreachy and Google Summer of Code.\nPassionate about making technology accessible and building welcoming tech communities.\nBoard director of codebar.io.</p>\n</div>","id":"marckk","irc":null,"linkedin":"karadelamarck","name":"Kara de la Marck","slug":"/blog/authors/marckk","twitter":"KaraMarck"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","id":"1be8a810-e566-5f46-aae8-affa7e1b8407","slug":"/blog/2020/09/19/jenkins-at-devops-world-2020/","strippedHtml":"The annual DevOps World, formerly known as DevOps World | Jenkins World is next week - Sept 22-24, with workshops on Sept 25. Just like other events this year, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that doesn’t mean there is a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There will be over 50 Jenkins/open source sessions and opportunities to virtually connect with over 20,000+ attendees on the event platform. Below are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :\n\nJenkins: Where It Is and Where It is Going\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 7:00 a.m.-7:30 a.m (PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Oleg Nenashev\n\nJenkins keeps evolving to address demands from its users and contributors: configuration as code, better support of cloud-native technologies, etc. Recently, we have introduced a public roadmap for the project, and there are many key initiatives in development and preview phases. This session will cover the current state of Jenkins and what’s next for the project.\n\nManaging DevSecOps Pipelines at Scale with Jenkins Templating Engine\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 11:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. (PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Steven Terrana\n\nAre you currently helping build or maintain a Jenkins pipeline for more than one application or team? Are you tired of copying and pasting Jenkinsfiles and tweaking them to fit each team’s specific needs? This session will feature a live demonstration of getting up and running with the Jenkins Templating Engine (JTE). Attendees will learn how to stop creating bespoke pipelines on a per-application basis and, instead, create tool-agnostic pipeline templates that multiple teams can inherit - regardless of tech stack.\n\neBay’s Journey Building CI at Scale\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 12:30 p.m.-1:00 p.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeakers: Ravi Kiran Rao Bukka & Vasumathy Seenuvasan\n\nA scalable CI platform with 6,000+ Jenkins instances serving around 43,000 builds per day on multi-cluster Kubernetes. A system built with metrics, key resource tuning, remediation’s and security in place. Join this session to hear from eBay on their journey of best practices and learnings about open source.\n\nMachine Learning Plugins for Data Science in Jenkins\n\nDate: Wednesday, September 23, 11:00 a.m.-11:15 a.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Loghi Perinpanayagam\n\nMachine Learning has evolved rapidly in the software industry for recent years. Jenkins CI/CD can be a good practice to deliver a high reliable product in the end. We have done an initial startup on this plugin that can be used to build Jupyter Notebooks, Python files and JSON files in Zeppelin format. In addition, the build wrappers could be used to convert Jupyter Notebooks to Python/JSON and/or copy the files to the workspace for more actions.  This Machine Learning plugin will endeavor to satisfy the data science community together with the help of other plugins. Success of this plugin will definitely serve much benefits to the community and Jenkins.\n\nJenkins UI Gets a Makeover\n\nDate: Thursday, September 24, 7:30 a.m.-8:00 a.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeakers: Felix Queiruga & Jeremy Hartley\n\nAn overview of the Jenkins UI overhaul. We are taking an iterative approach to gradually refresh the Jenkins UI. This approach will make Jenkins look fresh and modern, without changing the way users are accustomed to working with Jenkins or require plugins to be rewritten to render properly in the new Jenkins UI. Join this session to learn the changes we’ve made and how you can help to improve the Jenkins UI.\n\nThe event is free to everyone and recordings will be available on-demand. Registration is required to access the on-demand recordings. And don’t forget to visit the CDF booth in the expo hall for one on one Q&A’s with Jenkins experts.","title":"Jenkins at DevOps World 2020","tags":["events","conference","cicd","talks","workshops"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/8d248/alyssat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/c004c/alyssat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/9e67b/alyssat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/22924/alyssat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/89767/alyssat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/40d97/alyssat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/5028e/alyssat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":166}}},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"/blog/authors/alyssat","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3a8b2614-e129-54fc-90ed-707104f68f14","slug":"/blog/2020/02/07/trip-to-dwjw/","strippedHtml":"I had the privilege of being invited to DevOps World | Jenkins World\n2019 for presenting the work I did during Google Summer of Code 2019.\nWhat follows is a day-by-day summary of an amazing trip to the\nconference.\n\nDay 0: December 1, 2019\n\nI am an undergraduate student from New Delhi, India and had traveled to\nLisbon to attend the conference. I had an early morning flight to Lisbon\nfrom Delhi via Istanbul. At the Airport, I met Parichay who had been\nwaiting there from his connecting flight. After flying 8000 km, we\nreached Lisbon. We took a taxi to the hotel and were greeted there by\none of my Google Summer of Code mentors, Oleg. After four months of\nworking with him on my GSoC project, meeting him was an amazing\nexperience. Later that day, after stretching our legs in the hotel, we\nmet Long for an early dinner, who came to the hotel after exploring much\nof Lisbon.\n\nDay 1: Hackfest, December 2\n\nNext morning, we all met for breakfast where we all got to taste some\nPastel de Nata. We then took a cab to the Congress Centre for attending\nthe Jenkins and Jenkins X hackfest. At the Hackfest, I met Mark, Joseph,\nKasper, Andrey and other Jenkins contributors. I also met Oleg, this\ntime together with his son and his wife. After our introductions, and a\nshort presentation by Oleg, I started hacking on the Folder Auth plugin\nand made it possible to delete user sids from roles. The best part of\nhacking there was to get instant feedback on what I was working on. More\nand more people kept coming throughout the day. It was great to see so\nmany people working hard to improve Jenkins. At the end, everyone\npresented what they had achieved that day. Having skipped lunch for some\nsnacks, Oleg and others tried hard to get some pizza delivered without\nmuch success. After the Hackfest, everyone was hungry and most attendees\nincluding me went looking for nearby restaurants. Since it was early and\nmost restaurants were not open yet, we all decided to have burgers. It\nwas a great learning experience listening to and talking about Jenkins,\nElasticsearch, Jira, GitHub and a lot of other things. After that, we\ntook a taxi back to the hotel and I went to bed.\n\nDay 2: Contributor Summit, December 3\n\nWe had the Jenkins and Jenkins X contributor summit the next day. Me and\nParichay took the bus to the Congress Centre in the morning. After\nregistration, I got my ‘Speaker’ badge and the conference T-shirt. The\ncontributor summit took place in the same hall as the Hackfest, but the\nseating arrangement was completely different and there were a lot more\npeople. The summit started with everyone introducing themselves. It\nturned out that there were a lot of people from Munich. There were\npresentations and talks about all things Jenkins, Jenkins X and the\nContinuous Delivery Foundation by Kohsuke, Oleg, Joseph, Liam, Olivier,\nWadek and others. I had no experience with Jenkins X which made the\nsummit very interesting. After lunch, the talks were over, and everyone\nwas free to join any session discussing various things about Jenkins. I\nattended the Cloud Native Jenkins and the Configuration-as-Code\nsessions.\n\nWhile some of the conference attendees were in the Contributor summit,\nthe others were going through certifications and trainings. At around 5\no’clock in the evening, the summit and the trainings all got over and\nthe expo hall was thrown open. On the entrance, there was a large stack\nof big DWJW bags. I did not realize why those bags were kept there.\nSince everyone was taking one, I took one as well. As soon as I went\ninto the hall, I realized that those bags were for collecting swag. I\nhad never seen anything like this where sponsors were just giving away\nT-shirts, stickers and other stuff. There were snacks and Kohsuke was\ncutting the extremely tasty 15 years of Jenkins cake. After having the\ncake, I went on a swag-collecting spree going from one sponsor booth to\nthe other. This was an amazing experience, not only was I able to get\ncool stuff, I was also able to learn a lot about the software these\ncompanies made and how it fits into the DevOps pipeline.\n\nAfter the conference got over, me, Long and Parichay went to the Lisbon\nMariott Hotel for the Eurodog party. After collecting another T-shirt, I\nwent to the nearest restaurant (McDonald’s) with Andrey who I had\nearlier met at the Hackfest.\n\nDay 3: December 4\n\nThis was the first official day of the conference and it began with the\nkeynote. There were over 900 people in the keynote hall. It was amazing\nto see so many people attending the conference. After the keynote got\nover, I went to several sessions throughout the day learning about how\ncompanies are using Jenkins and implementing DevOps tools.\n\nIn the evening, we had the Sonatype Superparty which was a lot of fun.\nThere were neon lights, arcade machines, VR experiences, superheroes and\nmore swag. There was a lot of good food including pizzas and burgers and\nhot dogs. Superhero inspired desserts were very interesting. I was able\nto talk to Oleg and Wadek about the security challenges in Jenkins.\nDuring the party, I also got a chance to meet the CEO of CloudBees,\nSacha Labourey.\n\nDay 4, December 5\n\nThis was the last day of the conference and it began with another\nkeynote. After the keynote, I attended a very interesting talk on how\nthe European Observatory built software for large telescopes using\nJenkins. After that, I prepared for my talk on the work I did during\nGoogle Summer of Code 2019. I had my presentation in the community booth\nduring the lunch time. Presenting in front of real people was an amazing\nexperience and very different from the ones we had on Zoom chats for our\nGSoC evaluations. In the evening, I got another chance to present my\nproject at the Jenkins Community Lightning Talks.\n\nAfter that, the conference came to an end and I went back to the hotel.\nAfter relaxing for some time, me, Parichay and Long were invited by Oleg\nto a dinner at Corinthia Hotel with Kohsuke, Mark and his wife, Tracy,\nAlyssa, and Liam. Unfortunately, Long couldn’t attend the dinner because\nhe had the flight back earlier that evening. After the amazing dinner, I\nthanked everyone for such an amazing trip and said goodbye.\n\nDWJW was the best experience I’ve ever had. I was able to learn about a\nlot of new things and talk to some amazing people. In the end, I would\nlike to especially thank Oleg for helping me throughout and making it\npossible for me to attend such a wonderful conference. I would like to\nthank my other mentors Runze Xia and Supun for their support in my\nGoogle Summer of Code project. I would like to thank Google for\norganizing Google Summer of Code, everyone at Jenkins project for\nsponsoring my travel, and CloudBees for inviting me to the conference.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you all again soon!","title":"Trip to DevOps World | Jenkins

Summer of Code is much more than a summer internship program, it is a year-round effort for the organization and some community members.\nNow, after the DevOps World | Jenkins World conference in Lisbon and final retrospective meetings, we can say that GSoC 2019 is officially over.\nWe would like to start by thanking all participants: students, mentors, subject matter experts and all other contributors who proposed project ideas, participated in student selection, in community bonding and in further discussions and reviews.\nGoogle Summer of Code is a major effort which would not be possible without the active participation of the Jenkins community.\n\nIn this blogpost we would like to share the results and our experience from the previous year.\n\nResults\n\nFive GSoC projects were successfully completed this year:\nRole Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements,\nPlugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library,\nWorking Hours Plugin - UI Improvements,\nRemoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features,\nMulti-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM.\nWe will talk about the projects a little later in the document.\n\nProject details\n\nWe held the final presentations as Jenkins Online Meetups in late August and Google published the results on Sept 3rd.\nThe final presentations can be found here:\nPart 1,\nPart 2,\nPart 3.\nWe also presented the\n2019 Jenkins GSoC report\nat the DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco\nand at the\nDevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Lisbon conferences.\n\nIn the following sections, we present a brief summary of each project, links to the coding phase 3 presentations, and to the final products.\n\nRole Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements\n\nRole Strategy Plugin is one of the most widely used authorization plugins for Jenkins,\nbut it has never been famous for performance due to architecture issues and regular expression checks for project roles.\nAbhyudaya Sharma was working on this project together with hist mentors:\nOleg Nenashev, Runze Xia and Supun Wanniarachchi.\nHe started the project from creating a new Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins based on JMH,\ncreated benchmarks and achieved a 3501% improvement on some real-world scenarios.\nThen he went further and created a new Folder-based Authorization Strategy Plugin which offers even better performance for Jenkins instances where permissions are scoped to folders.\nDuring his project Abhyudaya also fixed the Jenkins Configuration-as-Code support in Role Strategy and contributed several improvements and fixes to the JCasC Plugin itself.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins,\nIntroducing new Folder Authorization Plugin, Performance Improvements to Role Strategy Plugin\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nSource code: Role Strategy Plugin, Folder Authorization Plugin\n\nPlugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library\n\nNatasha Stopa was working on a new CLI tool for plugin management,\nwhich should unify features available in other tools like install-plugins.sh in Docker images.\nIt also introduced many new features like YAML configuration format support, listing of available updates and security fixes.\nThe newly created tool should eventually replace the previous ones.\nNatasha’s mentors: Kristin Whetstone, Jon Brohauge and Arnab Banerjee.\nAlso, many contributors from Platform SIG and JCasC plugin team joined the project as a key stakeholders and subject-matter experts.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: alpha release announcement,\ncoding phase 2 updates\n\nFinal evaluation: slides,\nvideo\n\nSource code: Plugin installation manager tool\n\nWorking Hours Plugin - UI Improvements\n\nJenkins UI and frontend framework are a common topic in the Jenkins project,\nespecially in recent months after the new UX SIG was established.\nJack Shen was working on exploring new ways to build Jenkins Web UI together with his mentor Jeff Pearce.\nJack updated the Working Hours Plugin to use UI controls provided by standard React libraries.\nThen he documented his experienced and created template for plugins with React-based UI.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: Updates on Working Hours Plugin UI,\nReact Plugin Template\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nSource code: Working Hours Plugin, Template for Jenkins plugins with React-based UI\n\nRemoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features\n\nLong Le Vu Nguyen was working on extended Kubernetes support in the Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin.\nHis mentors were Andrey Falco and Pham vu Tuan who was our GSoC 2018 student and the plugin creator.\nDuring this project Long has added a new agent launcher which provisions Jenkins agents in Kubernetes and connects them to the controller.\nHe also created a Cloud API implementation for it and a new Helm chart which can provision Jenkins as entire system in Kubernetes,\nwith Apache Kafka enabled by default.\nAll these features were released in Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog post for [Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nPlugin source code\n\nMulti-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM\n\nParichay Barpanda was working on the new GitLab Branch Source Plugin with Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs and Folder Organisation support.\nHis mentors were\nMarky Jackson-Taulia,\nJustin Harringa,\nZhao Xiaojie and\nJoseph Petersen.\nThe plugin scans the projects, importing the pipeline jobs it identifies based on the criteria provided.\nAfter a project is imported, Jenkins immediately runs the jobs based on the Jenkinsfile pipeline script and notifies the status to GitLab Pipeline Status.\nThis plugin also provides GitLab server configuration which can be configured in Configure System or via Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC).\nread more about this project in the GitLab Branch Source 1.0 announcement.\n\nProject page\n\nCoding phase 3 presentation\n\nGitlab Branch Source Plugin, Gitlab API plugin\n\nProjects which were not completed\n\nNot all projects have been completed this year.\nWe were also working on Artifact Promotion plugin for Jenkins Pipeline\nand on Cloud Features for External Workspace Manager Plugin,\nbut unfortunately both projects were stopped after coding phase 1.\nAnyway, we got a lot of experience and takeaways in these areas (see linked Jira tickets!.\nWe hope that these stories will be implemented by Jenkins contributors at some point.\nGoogle Summer of Code 2020 maybe?\n\nRunning the GSoC program at our organization level\n\nHere are some of the things our organization did before and during GSoC behind the scenes.\nTo prepare for the influx of students, we updated all our GSoC pages and wrote down all the knowledge we accumulated over the years of running the program.\nWe started preparing in October 2018, long before the official start of the program.\nThe main objective was to address the feedback we got during GSoC 2018 retrospectives.\n\nProject ideas.\nWe started gathering project ideas in the last months of 2018.\nWe prepared a list of project ideas in a Google doc, and we tracked ownership of each project in a table of that document.\nEach project idea was further elaborated in its own Google doc.\nWe find that when projects get complicated during the definition phase, perhaps they are really too complicated and should not be done.\n\nSince we wanted all the project ideas to be documented the same way, we created a template to guide the contributors.\nMost of the project idea documents were written by org admins or mentors, but occasionally a student proposed a genuine idea.\nWe also captured contact information in that document such as GitHub and Gitter handles, and a preliminary list of potential mentors for the project.\nWe embedded all the project documents on our website.\n\nMentor and student guidelines.\nWe updated the mentor information page with details on what we expect mentors to do during the program,\nincluding the number of hours that are expected from mentors,\nand we even have a section on preventing conflict of interest.\nWhen we recruit mentors, we point them to the mentor information page.\n\nWe also updated the student information page.\nWe find this is a huge time saver as every student contacting us has the same questions about joining and participating in the program.\nInstead of re-explaining the program each time, we send them a link to those pages.\n\nApplication phase.\nStudents started to reach out very early on as well, many weeks before GSoC officially started.\nThis was very motivating.\nSome students even started to work on project ideas before the official start of the program.\n\nProject selection. This year the org admin team had some very difficult decisions to make.\nWith lots of students, lots of projects and lots of mentors, we had to request the right number of slots and try to match the projects with the most chances of success.\nWe were trying to form mentor teams at the same time as we were requesting the number of slots, and it was hard to get responses from all mentors in time for the deadline.\nFinally we requested fewer slots than we could have filled.\nWhen we request slots, we submit two numbers: a minimum and a maximum. The GSoC guide states that:\n\nThe minimum is based on the projects that are so amazing they really want to see these projects occur over the summer,\n\nand the maximum number should be the number of solid and amazing projects they wish to mentor over the summer.\n\nWe were awarded minimum. So we had to make very hard decisions: we had to decide between \"amazing\" and \"solid\" proposals.\nFor some proposals, the very outstanding ones, it’s easy.\nBut for the others, it’s hard.\nWe know we cannot make the perfect decision, and by experience, we know that some students or some mentors will not be able to complete the program due to uncontrollable life events, even for the outstanding proposals.\nSo we have to make the best decision knowing that some of our choices won’t complete the program.\n\nCommunity Bonding.\nWe have found that the community bonding phase was crucial to the success of each project.\nUsually projects that don’t do well during community bonding have difficulties later on.\nIn order to get students involved in the community better, almost all projects were handled under the umbrella of Special Interest Groups so that there were more stakeholders and communications.\n\nCommunications.\nEvery year we have students who contact mentors via personal messages.\nStudents, if you are reading this, please do NOT send us personal messages about the projects, you will not receive any preferential treatment.\nObviously, in open source we want all discussions to be public, so students have to be reminded of that regularly.\nIn 2019 we are using Gitter chat for most communications, but from an admin point of view this is more fragmented than mailing lists.\nIt is also harder to search.\nChat rooms are very convenient because they are focused, but from an admin point of view, the lack of threads in Gitter makes it hard to get an overview.\nGitter threads were added recently (Nov 2019) but do not yet work well on Android and iOS.\nWe adopted Zoom Meetings towards the end of the program and we are finding it easier to work with than Google Hangouts.\n\nStatus tracking.\nAnother thing that was hard was to get an overview of how all the projects were doing once they were running.\nWe made extensive use of Google sheets to track lists of projects and participants during the program\nto rank projects and to track statuses of project phases (community bonding, coding, etc.).\nIt is a challenge to keep these sheets up to date, as each project involves several people and several links.\nWe have found it time consuming and a bit hard to keep these sheets up to date, accurate and complete, especially up until the start of the coding phase.\n\nPerhaps some kind of objective tracking tool would help.\nWe used Jenkins Jira for tracking projects, with each phase representing a separate sprint.\nIt helped a lot for successful projects.\nIn our organization, we try to get everyone to beat the deadlines by a couple of days, because we know that there might be events such as power outages,\nbad weather (happens even in Seattle!), or other uncontrolled interruptions, that might interfere with submitting project data.\nWe also know that when deadlines coincide with weekends, there is a risk that people may forget.\n\nRetrospective.\nAt the end of our project, we also held a retrospective and captured some ideas for the future.\nYou can find the notes here.\nWe already addressed the most important comments in our documentation and project ideas for the next year.\n\nRecognition\n\nLast year, we wanted to thank everyone who participated in the program by sending swag.\nThis year, we collected all the mailing addresses we could and sent to everyone we could the 15-year Jenkins special edition T-shirt, and some stickers.\nThis was a great feel good moment.\nI want to personally thank Alyssa Tong her help on setting aside the t-shirt and stickers.\n\nMentor summit\n\nEach year Google invites two or more mentors from each organization to the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit.\nAt this event, hundreds of open-source project maintainers and mentors meet together and have unconference sessions targeting GSoC, community management and various tools.\nThis year the summit was held in Munich,\nand we sent Marky Jackson and Oleg Nenashev as representatives there.\n\nApart from discussing projects and sharing chocolate, we also presented Jenkins there, conducted a lightning talk and hosted the unconference session about automation bots for GitHub.\nWe did not make a team photo there, so try to find Oleg and Marky on this photo:\n\nGSoC Team at DevOps World | Jenkins World\n\nWe traditionally use GSoC organization payments and travel grants to sponsor student trips to major Jenkins-related events.\nThis year four students traveled to the DevOps World | Jenkins World conferences in San-Francisco and Lisbon.\nStudents presented their projects at the community booth and at the contributor summits,\nand their presentations got a lot of traction in the community!\n\nThanks a lot to Google and CloudBees who made these trips possible.\nYou can find a travel report from Natasha Stopa here,\nmore travel reports are coming soon.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis year, five projects were successfully completed.\nWe find this to be normal and in line with what we hear from other participating organizations.\n\nTaking the time early to update our GSoC pages saved us a lot of time later because we did not have to repeat all the information every time someone contacted us.\nWe find that keeping track of all the mentors, the students, the projects, and the meta information is a necessary but time consuming task.\nWe wish we had a tool to help us do that.\nCoordinating meetings and reminding participants of what needs to be accomplished for deadlines is part of the cheerleading aspect of GSoC, we need to keep doing this.\n\nLastly, I want to thank again all participants, we could not do this without you.\nEach year we are impressed by the students who do great work and bring great contributions to the Jenkins community.\n\nGSoC 2020?\n\nYes, there will be Google Summer of Code 2020!\nWe plan to participate, and we are looking for project ideas, mentors and students.\nJenkins GSoC pages have been already updated towards the next year, and we invite everybody interested to join us next year!\n\nMain page with all contacts\n\nGSoC 2020 Project

This was great\nand I wanted to share in hopes of encouraging more people to join.\nYou can learn more about the Google Summer of Code here: https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/\n\nCommunity Bonding\n\nThe first phase of the project is the community bonding phase. This is where the student and other mentors come together\nto lay out the plan for the project. It is important to set expectations and ensure that the student is well aware of\nwhat will take place and also made to feel welcome.\n\nParichay Barpanda was the student and he was super awesome from the get go. The project he was working on was the Gitlab\nBranch Source Plugin. More can be found here: jenkinsci/gitlab-branch-source-plugin\n\nFrom the mentor side it was myself and Justin Harringa. Justin was just amazing throughout this project and I seriously\ncould not have done this without him. He was encouraging, empathetic and just all around great. I would gladly serve\nwith him again.\n\nWe laid out our plan and guidance and got to work.\n\nFirst Evaluations\n\nThe first evaluation was quickly upon us and Parichay was ready!\nThe work he put in was nothing shy of amazing. We did our 1st demo and he really rocked it. A video of that demo can be\nfound on : Youtube\n\nSecond Evaluations\n\nThere was not much time to rest before we realized that phase II end was upon us but Parichay was ready. Again, he\nnailed it.\n\nThat demo can be found here\n\nMentors Submit Final Evaluations\n\nWe had our final evaluation and at this point Parichay was seasoned. He was getting issues assigned to him, working on\nlittle bug fixes and setting his roadmap for features. He absolutely blew Justin and I away.\n\nParichay’s final evaluation demo can be seen here\n\nAt the conclusion of the final demo’s, Justin and I met and went over Parichay’s final evaluation. At this point we had\nmet twice a week for several months, we have reviewed code daily, we had community involvement and most of all we had\nseen Parichay grow into a seasoned software developer.\n\nJustin and I were without a doubt passing Parichay on his entire body of work. I am actually tearing up typing this\nbecause I am so proud of Parichay.\n\nOrg Admin\n\nBeing an org admin for the 2019 Google Summer of Code project for the Jenkins organization was truly rewarding and couldn’t\nhave been accomplished without the help from Oleg Nenashev, Martin d’Anjou, Jeff Pearce and Lloyd Chang.\n\nAs an org admin we handled issues with mentors, community members and disagreements involving work. These items were only\na few and as a team we handled them accordingly.\n\nWe regularly met to discuss and plan. Coordinating and dealing with a project like Google Summer of Code is no small feat\nbut this team made it super easy and I am so thankful for them and all that I learned.\n\nClosing\n\nIn looking back at this experience I am so grateful for the opportunity I was given. This was such a rewarding experience\nto not only be able to mentor but also be an org admin. Not only will I be back next year (we are already in the\nplanning stages) but I highly encourage people reading this to consider joining. You will not be disappointed.\n\nI am so thankful for all the students, mentors and fellow org admins. Your dedication to open source is so valued. You\nshowed and continue to show what this project is all about, and that is being welcoming, open and transparent. Helping\npeople grow as individuals while learning skills is what I love about this community.\n\nThank you to everyone and I hope your futures are bright!","title":"Google Summer of Code Mentor and Org Admin Perspective","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2019","jenkins","community","events","mentor"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!
