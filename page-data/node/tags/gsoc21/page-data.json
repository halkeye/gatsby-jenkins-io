Thus, Jetstack/cert-manager is used to provision TLS certificates and establish connection between Kubernetes API and webhook.\n\nImplementaion\n\nOperator-SDK takes care of creating a new webhook and appending it to the manager and creating handlers.\nTls certificates are managed using cert-manager.\n\nValidation Logic:\n\nProposed Implementations: Iterate through the list of plugins to be installed and fetch warnings for each plugin from the plugin center API and check if the version of that plugin has any of those warnings.\n\nCaveats: Webhooks add latency to an API request, hence they should evaluate as quickly as possible thus having max allowed timeout of 30s. In the earlier approach I was fetching the security warnings from the plugin site API in the validator interface itself, and since network operations are slow, it was causing a timeout in the case of validating a larger number of plugins or when the Internet connection was not good.\n\nUpdated Implementaion: Instead of fetching information for each plugin, the information about all the plugins is downloaded and cached at the start of the operator and updated periodically, thus eliminating network calls and finishing validation in less than a second.\n\nEvaluation Phase 1:\n\nScaffoled a new validation webhook\n\nAdded manifests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, certificates and volumes, and updated Makefile\n\nImplemented the validator interface\n\nUpdated helm charts\n\nEvaluation Phase 2:\n\nReimplemented the validator interface.\n\nAdded unit tests for internal functions\n\nAdded e2e tests along with helm tests\n\nUpdated helm charts\n\nResources\n\nPull Requests\n\nAdded validation webhook,manifests,and updated Makefile\n\nImplemented validation logic,added tests and updated helm charts\n\nPhase 1 demo\n\nUser Guide\n\nThe webhook feature is completely optional for the user. It can be easily deployed using Helm Chart by setting webhook.enabled in values.yaml and in the Operator command line flag.\n\nwebhook.enabled=true\n\nTo enable security validation in the jenkins custom resource set\n\njenkins.ValidateSecurityWarnings=true\n\nNote: The webhook takes some time to get up and running, also when helm renders the template, the validating webhook configuration is applied last, hence if the user wants to deploy the Jenkins Custom Resource with validation turned on, he needs to wait for some time. After the webhook is up and running the user can deploy the Jenkins Custom Resource using helm or kubectl\n\nFuture work\n\nImplementing a post-install hook in the helm charts that checks whether the webhook is up and running.\n\nAdding validation for required core version of plugin and core version of Jenkins.\n\nMigrating other validation logic from controller to the webhook.\n\nAdding validation for the dependencies of the plugins.","title":"Security Validator for Jenkins Operator for Kubernetes","tags":["gsoc21","kubernetes","security","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a88848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/67151/sharmapulkit04.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/ede19/sharmapulkit04.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/bc20c/sharmapulkit04.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/67151/sharmapulkit04.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/f76df/sharmapulkit04.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/8ba60/sharmapulkit04.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/a9ea7/sharmapulkit04.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/8c23b/sharmapulkit04.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/fc98a/sharmapulkit04.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":131}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/sharmapulkit04.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"sharmapulkit04","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A Student at the Indian Institute of Technology(BHU) Varanasi, Pulkit is currently working on a GSoC Project under Jenkins where he aims to add a security validator to the Jenkins Kubernetes Operator.</p>\n</div>","id":"sharmapulkit04","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Pulkit Sharma","slug":"/blog/authors/sharmapulkit04","twitter":"anarchist_04"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"gsoc21","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
