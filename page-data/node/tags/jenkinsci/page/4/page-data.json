And I’ll present a lightning talk about Continuous Delivery with Jenkins.\n\n+\n+\n\nHere is short overview of what I’d like to talk about there.\n\n+\n+\n\n1. Continuous Build\n\n+\n+\n\nMy starting point was to get to know JenkinsCI. Our developers used JenkinsCI to make the Continuous Build of our software.\nSo, our developing environment was quite Jenkins friendly from the beginning.\n\n+\n+\n\n2. Continuous Deploy\n\n+\n+\n\n--- Virtual Machine ---\n\n+\n+\n\nWe had to have an environment where we could deploy our new build. As we are big fans of Microsoft, we decided to use Azure as our environment to make Continuous Testing.\n\n+\n+\n\nHow do we control it? We use Powershell, which can be executed with JenkinsCI.\n\n+\n+\n\n--- Product Deployment ---\n\n+\n+\n\nHow did we achieve the Continuous Deploy? Actually, my boss, who is DirectSmile’s Yoda developed a very powerful tool called “DirectSmile Installation Service” to enable this.\n\n+\n+\n\nSo we integrated this tool within JenkinsCI, and now Jenkins can deploy DirectSmile products on any target server with just one-button-click!\n\n+\n+\n\n3. Continuous Testing\n\n+\n+\n\nOf course, we use JenkinsCI to make the Continuous Testing.\nHow do we do that?\nWe use Selenium to make and run tests. So we can cover most features and we can execute it at anytime.\n\n+\n+\n\nWe are doing it after every new version build, to obtain Continuous Delivery.\n\n+\n+\n\n4. Continuous Sharing\n\n+\n+\n\nI think it’s important to share all knowledge and experiences I have had with others, especially those whom have just started with Continuous Delivery.\n\n+\n+\n\nDon’t worry, it is probably much easier than you think.\n\n+\n+\n\nAs a part of this practice, I’d like to share all my knowledge and experiences with how easy it is to achieve Continuous Delivery with Jenkins at JUC 2015.\n\n+\n+\n\nI’m really exciting to meet and talk about this there! See you at JUC 2015 in London!\n\n+\n+\n\nAbout Me\n\n+\n+\n\nMy name is Nobuaki Ogawa, from Japan, and I currently work in Berlin, Germany for the software company DirectSmile as a DevOps QA Manager.\n\n+\n+\n\nFrom the very first time I used JenkinsCI, it helped me a lot. Almost all the work I did last year was mainly with Continuous Delivery with Jenkins.\n\n+\n+\n\nFrom Build to Deploy, Test, and even Maintenance and Monitoring, my Jenkins takes care of everything.\n\n+\n+\n\nIt was super easy to achieve Continuous Delivery in the DirectSmile world with the help of JenkinsCI.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/02-03-1530-ogawa_0.jpg[image,width=152,height=182] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Nobuaki Ogawa, DevOps QA Manager at DirectSmile.

Jenkins plays a critical role.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe “digital channel” is an industry buzzword for many companies these days. The digital channel represents a company’s content that is delivered by websites and mobile devices. Companies want the same website to work across any channel in multiple browsers and different operating systems. They also want that same website to work across an explosion of mobile devices. Add the new generation of smart watches showing up and testing is becoming a huge challenge for IT departments. One big issue is there is too much duplication of testing efforts.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn a perfect world, you would create a core set of test automation scripts that work across all digital channels. A client recently requested that my team and I create this perfect-world scenario, and we are doing just that. Jenkins pulls it all together by managing the execution and reporting.\n\n+\n+\n\nJoin me for my talk to learn how I’m using Jenkins, Selenium, TestNG, and Perfecto Mobile to solve the digital channel testing challenges for one client.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/01-02-1030-dang_0.jpg[image,width=149,height=180] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by David Dang, VP of Automation Solutions at Zenergy Technologies.

Over 250 people showed up. It was, to be completely honest, a bit shocking to me - that little project I’d gotten involved with less than three years earlier was big enough, interesting enough, important enough for 250 people to travel from around the world to spend a day talking about it? That’s an amazing feeling, and it was an amazing day. Since then, there’ve been three more JUCs in the Bay Area, three in Israel and two in Europe, with more talks on more Jenkins subjects and an ever-increasing number of attendees. This year, there are another four scheduled - three of them for two days each this time! Find out more about the first two, JUC US East and JUC Europe, below!\n\n+\n+\n\nNot only are there enough worthy talks to merit a full day a few times a year - now there are enough to merit two days! At JUC US East 2015 outside Washington, DC on June 18 and 19, you can see talks on the Workflow plugin for Jenkins, test automation, mobile testing, plugin development, and a few talks on new and fascinating ways people are using Jenkins - even driving big data workflows! And then, just a few days later, on June 23 and 24 in London, there’s JUC Europe 2015, with talks covering things like the fantastic Job DSL plugin, reproducible build environments, Jenkins and Docker together, and my personal favorite, the 2015 edition of my Seven Habits of Highly Effective Jenkins Users talk.\n\n+\n+\n\nWhether you’re interested in the latest innovations in continuous integration and delivery, or you’re a Jenkins plugin developer wanting to learn how to make your plugins more mature and useful, or you’re a Jenkins administrator trying to understand how to provide your users with a great platform for their builds and testing, or even if you’ve just heard about CI/CD and you want to find out more, the Jenkins User Conferences are a great opportunity to see all those things and meet with other Jenkins users and developers. I’m excited to attend my fifth JUC in London, and I hope to see you there!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/smallerme.jpeg[image,width=150,height=188] +\n\n+\n\nThis post is by Andrew Bayer, build and tools architect at Cloudera and longtime Jenkins contributor.

Are you at JUC because you want to learn more? Has your company been pushing you to use Jenkins or to adapt a more agile build/test process using a Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration method?\n\n+\n+\n\nJenkins 101 is going to give you an introduction to Jenkins and get you started in the right direction. Many sessions may be too in-depth, too specialized, or do a deep dive too fast, and while that is good for the more intermediate Jenkins user, the beginner can get lost fast and lose interest. My session will go through the basics of Jenkins, so anyone without prior knowledge can get up and running in just a short amount of time. We will cover building/configuring jobs, design of pipelines, security of your Jenkins controller, fun groovy scripts and useful plugins to get you started. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced Jenkins user, you can always learn from how others are using Jenkins. Attend this session early on in your JUC lineup, so that you get the most out of the conference!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/01-02-1600-McCollum_0.png[image,width=149,height=180] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Lorelei McCollum, Software Engineer at IBM.

Will Soula is returning this year to JUC U.S. East to “chat” about “Chat Ops and Jenkins.” Lorelei McCollum is also back with two talks at JUC U.S. East called “Jenkins 101” and “Getting Groovy with Jenkins.”\n\n+\n+\n\nThis year, you will notice a few differences in the JUC agendas. JUC is now a two-day conference in the U.S. East, Europe and U.S. West locations! Also, each session is assigned a category according to its content: Continuous Delivery, Best Practices, Operations, Plugins, Case Studies/War Stories and more. This will help you decide which talks to attend. You will also notice that several talks, especially in JUC Europe, reflect the industry’s growing interest in big data and Docker.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe agendas are still being finalized for JUC Israel and JUC U.S. West. If you are interested in speaking at either of these locations, you can still send in your talk proposals. The U.S. West deadline is May 3 and the Israel deadline is May 15.\n\n+\n+\n\nJUC is such a great opportunity for the community to come together and network face-to-face. You can meet Kohsuke Kawaguchi, creator of the Jenkins project, Gene Kim, author of The Phoenix Project and DevOps expert, but you will also have the opportunity to meet Jenkins users, just like you, from all over the world. And this year, with the Jenkins project at well over 100K active installations, JUC as a whole will be the largest gathering of Jenkins users ever.\n\n+\n+\n\nEarly bird pricing for JUC U.S. East and Europe ends May 1, so REGISTER NOW to take advantage of the lower pricing.","title":"Jenkins User Conference - Agenda News","tags":["general","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"blog/author/hinman","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"0032620d-d2e2-5b0c-abbb-713b204b7bd9","slug":"/blog/2015/03/25/registration-for-juc-2015-is-open/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bqbz9JQIIAA9gKG.jpg[image,width=300,height=225] +\n\n+\n+\n\nIt’s that time of the year again: 2015 Jenkins User Conference Registration is OPEN for all cities.

The building was inaugurated as a cinema in 1961. With 1001 seats, it was the largest, most modern and most popular film theatre in the former GDR and has since been extensively modernized in line with the requirements of historically listed buildings.\n\nWe have an excellent line-up of speakers filling up two conference tracks.\n\nOnce again, we have some fabulous sponsors to thank. Without them, there would be no JUC.\n\nThis year we’ve introduced a new Community sponsorship level, which allows non-corporate groups like JUGSs to help support the conference as well. (Drop a note to juc-oc-ext AT cloudbees DOT com if your group is interested).\n\nWe are very grateful to all of our sponsors – thank you! Hopefully see everyone at JUC.\n\nPS – if you are coming to Berlin for JUC, check out the CD Summit on June 24 at the same venue. There’s also one on June 19 in NYC.
