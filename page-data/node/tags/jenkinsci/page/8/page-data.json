All you need to do is send an email to \" hudson-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com\" and you’ll receive a confirmation email from the mailing list server shortly.\n\nSince our issues.hudson-ci.org isn’t actually hosted on Java.net, but rather on a machine provided by Oracle, they should continue to function as per usual. The login for the systems is somewhat tied to Java.net so I am honestly not sure how stable they will be this week.\n\nI apologize sincerely for the confusion and frustration, you can trust that we’re likely ten-times more frustrated with this situation right now.\n---","title":"New Hudson Mailing Lists!","tags":["general","mailing list","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

The reporting feature has been sending information back to the Hudson team to help us understand how Hudson is used in aggregate; the info being reported includes the number of jobs configured, agent configurations, what plugins (and what versions of those plugins) are installed, and more. This data has not been available publicly until now! The raw data needed to be decrypted and scrubbed of any potentially identifying information, such as non-public plugin names or usernames in snapshot versions. We’ve finally scrubbed the data and are making it available!\n\nThe data is currently in monthly JSON bundles, organized by unique install key. We’ve filtered out reports of installations without any jobs configured, as well as any installations with only one report in a given month.\n\nIf you’d like access to the data, please send an email to dev@hudson.dev.java.net or jump onto the IRC channel and ask - we’ll send you the URL and a private username/password which you’ll need to access the info.

We’re currently building Hudson proper, the Hudson core RC branch, individual builds for the various Hudson plugins and Gerrit, as well as various libraries and infrastructure jobs Hudson depends on.\n\nWe’re currently running all those builds on a dedicated Linux agent, generously provided to the Hudson project by Digg, my employer. This has been great - except for the day when I’d just added all the individual plugin jobs for the first time, we haven’t had real problems with capacity. But we are limited in the environments we can run our tests on as a result of only having a Linux agent. We’re currently playing with a temporary Windows agent, but we’d really like to have at least one more permanent Windows agent, and a Mac agent as well, so that we can run Hudson’s core integration tests on those platforms as well. Since this is Hudson we’re talking about, we don’t need the agent to be in any given physical location - we just need it to be running the agent process and talking to our server. If you’re interested in helping us out with this, please contact me at andrew dot bayer at gmail dot com.

But what if you’re a plugin developer and you don’t want to use Subversion? Well, we have an alternative for your source code: host it with Hudson on GitHub.\n\nTo get this in place, send an email to dev@hudson.dev.java.net (or ask in the IRC channel) asking to get a repository created for your plugin at Github. Make sure to include the name of the plugin and your Github username (and the Github usernames of any other developers who’ll be pushing to your plugin’s repo). If your plugin is already in Github, include the URL for the existing repo so that we can fork it. One of the Hudson admins will create the repository (forking if appropriate) and add the user(s) to the list of users with push access to the Hudson-hosted repositories at Github. Once you hear back from them, you’ll be able to push code to the new repository.\n\nYou will need to make a few changes to your plugin’s POM, as compared to what works for a plugin POM in the java.net Subversion tree.\n\nFirst, add the following to the ++ section:\n\norg.apache.maven.plugins\nmaven-release-plugin\n2.0\n\norg.apache.maven.scm\nmaven-scm-provider-gitexe\n1.3\n\nThis is needed to make sure we’re overriding the parent POM’s SCM provider settings. Next, add the following to the ++ section:\n\norg.jvnet.wagon-svn\nwagon-svn\n1.9\n\nThis is needed because we’re still going to be using wagon-svn to deploy the artifacts in the release process. Lastly, add an ` section, within the ` section of the POM, like the following:\n\nscm:git:git://github.com/hudson/your-plugin-repo.git\nscm:git:git@github.com:hudson/your-plugin-repo.git\nhttps://github.com/hudson/your-plugin-repo\n\nAs with the first section, this is needed to override the default SCM settings in the parent POM. Make sure to change \"your-plugin-repo\" to your actual plugin repository name, of course! It’d also be a good idea to put a link to your Github repo on your plugin’s wiki page at the Hudson wiki, since the default source link will go to Subversion.\n\nNow, with these changes in place, committed and pushed to the master branch in your plugin’s repository, you should be able to run \"mvn release:prepare release:perform\" just as you would if the plugin were hosted in Subversion, with your plugin showing up in the Update Center within a few hours. Be sure that you’ve configured the login information for the java.net Maven repository, as detailed here - this is still needed for plugins hosted at and released from Github, since Hudson’s Maven repository still lives at java.net. If you run into any issues releasing your plugin from Github, first be sure to review the wiki page on plugin hosting, which addresses many of the issues you may encounter when running the Maven release plugin.\n\nIf you’re still stumped, feel free to email the Hudson developer list or ask in the IRC channel for help.","title":"Hosting your Hudson plugin at Github","tags":["development","meta","plugins","tutorial","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"abayer","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Andrew was a core committer to Hudson and the author of numerous plugins.</p>\n</div>","id":"abayer","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Andrew Bayer","slug":"/blog/authors/abayer","twitter":"abayer"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":"bd805a6f-8767-5565-9c87-25112f499520","slug":"/blog/2010/07/27/hudson-1-368-released/","strippedHtml":"Regular readers will recognize that I’ve been slacking off quite a bit lately with my release announcements, my apologies.
