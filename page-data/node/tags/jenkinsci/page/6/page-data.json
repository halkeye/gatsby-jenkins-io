Jenkins is starting to get to be that age, having been started over 6 years ago.\n\nOne of the most commonly asked questions, is about Jenkins' use of \"blue balls\" to indicate success by default. This is enough of an \"issue\" for some users that the Green Balls plugin is in the list of top 10 installed plugins.\n\nThe reason behind our use of blue to indicate success has its basis in Kohsuke’s Japanese upbringing. The cultural differences were enumerated in a bug report comically titled \"s/blue/green/g\" ( JENKINS-369):\n\nThis response Kohsuke cited was taken from this Q&A thread\n\nQ.\" Why do Japanese people say that they have blue traffic lights when they are really green?\" --Question submitted by John Sypal\n\nA: According to the book, Japan From A to Z: Mysteries of Everyday\nLife Explained by James and Michiko Vardaman, the first traffic\nsignals in Japan were blue instead of green, but the blue lights were difficult to see from a long distance away so they were replaced with green ones. Vardaman says that the custom of referring to traffic lights is a holdover from those days.\n\nThis sounds like a good explanation, but the problem with it is that you will hear Japanese people refer to other green things (like\ncucumbers, spinach, and sometimes grass) as being blue as well. This\nis because historically, Japanese people considered green to be a\nshade of blue. For example, the Chinese character for blue,\npronounced ao is made up of two characters, iki (life) and i (well)\nand refers to the colour of plants which grow around a well, a colour between green and blue. When Chinese people see the character, they say it means green, but Japanese people say it means blue.\n\nJapanese books on colours tell us that there are four tertiary colours: red, blue, white and black, and that all others are shades of those four main ones. Ao, therefore, is a sort of ideal blue, halfway between green and blue. The sky is said to be blue, but it is a different shade of ao than a traffic light is. Tree leaves are said to be green, but green is a shade of ao, like crimson is a shade of red.\n\nIn another interesting cultural difference relating\nto colour, Japanese children always colour the sun red instead of\nyellow.\n\n( here’s a direct link to Kohsuke’s comment )\n\nUnfortunately it’s not for color blind users, although that’s a pretty convincing explanation. Jenkins has blue balls because in Japan, red means stop and blue means go!\n\nImage courtesy of this site","title":"Why does Jenkins have blue balls?","tags":["general","just for fun","jenkinsci"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","id":"4e4e2b32-5616-5428-a8f3-ee1c68507a51","slug":"/blog/2012/01/04/building-jenkins-plugins-with-gradle/","strippedHtml":"Until now, Jenkins plugins written in Java or Groovy could only be built with Maven, using the maven-hpi-plugin to generate a proper manifest and archive which Jenkins can consume.

Instead, what it does mean, is that the Jenkins mainline is much more friendly to runtime analysis of classes with which it is not familiar.\n\nThe problem\n\nWhen analyzing plugin classes, Jenkins uses just about every kind of metadata you can think of to get information about them: Class name, Field names, method names, member modifiers, annotations, you name it. It even uses the containing class relationship for inner classes to match Descriptors with what they describe.\n\nIt’s all a great example of convention over configuration (CoC). In fact, I’ve never really seen CoC implemented in a Java project before as successfully as it has been in Jenkins. Plugin authors don’t have to duplicate any metadata that Jenkins can figure out for you — and it’s alot! The drawback though, is that extensions depend very heavily on conforming to the structure of a conventional Java class.\n\nThe changes in this merge, and in several of the modules on which Jenkins depends, allow more than ever to get this information by asking an object directly rather than querying its private class structure.\n\nThe Kicker\n\nMany of theses changes aren’t even JRuby specific! While they do enable JRuby integration, They’re really just making things more friendly for dynamic languages in general. So, in theory, it should pave the way for others like JavaScript and Python.\n\nWhere now?\n\nWe’re still working on the ruby runtime and tools which will provide as crisp a Ruby development experience as we can. I don’t want to proffer an estimate of when those will begin to be useable, but it is important to mark this very important milestone and explain what it does and does not mean.\n\nWe need you!\n\nThere is still much work to be done to enable a writing Jenkins plugins in Ruby, we are looking for people who know Ruby and feel like pitching in: writing Rake tasks, improving the glue layer, documentation, etc.\n\nIf you’re interested, most of the action is happening on the jenkinsrb@googlegroups.com mailing list, so join us!","title":"JRuby Branch merged!","tags":["development","core","jenkinsci","ruby","jruby"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b8816000-c17a-523b-b88f-638b6fb6ab53","slug":"/blog/2011/06/14/upcoming-events-in-june-and-early-july/","strippedHtml":"I’ve just added three events coming up in the next few weeks to the Jenkins calendar.

I’ll be giving a quick talk on the state of the Jenkins project, followed by Ullrich Haffner (the author of the static analysis plugins for Jenkins) giving a quick talk on how those plugins are used. After that, we’ll be having a hackathon, and then more beer! Again, you can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA week later, the London CI meetup group is hosting a meetup as well, on Wednesday, July 6th, starting at 6:30pm.
