One of the forty-two Docker Hacks has some familiar names attached…​\n\n+\n+\n\nNicolas De Loof and Yoann Dubreuil from Docker Rennes, who are also active in our community, waved the Jenkins flag in this event and produced Jenkins docker agents plugin.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThis plugin lets you run builds inside containers, and in that sense it's similar to https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Docker+Plugin[the Docker plugin] and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Custom+Build+Environment+Plugin[the Docker custom build environment plugin]. But internally it uses a quite interesting approach. +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThis fresh new implementation relies on a set of docker containers (aka ‘pod’) to setup a build executor, letting development team customize the build environment for their need without any constraint or prerequisite, and relying on docker containers to host test resources.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThis project https://blog.docker.com/2015/09/docker-global-hack-day-3-winners/[won the 3rd place in the Freestyle category of Docker Hack Day].

Obviously, the developers in the project deal with individual bug reports and feature requests all the time, but sometimes those day-to-day issues distract you from a bigger picture.\n\nThis year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend over time. But we also wanted to bring in some questions around how you are using Jenkins and what other technologies you leverage such as Linux containers and cloud services.\n\nThe survey will close at the end of September and, if you participate, you’ll get to see the results first. CloudBees is sponsoring the survey and as an added incentive for us to fill it out, CloudBees has pitched in a $100 Amazon gift card (thanks CloudBees!). Information you submit is only going to be used by the community and not by CloudBees. So please take the survey and let your voice be heard.\n\nFinally, there are laws that govern prize giveaways like this and CloudBees has put up terms and conditions for this.\n\nTake the survey here","title":"Take the 2015 Jenkins Survey!","tags":["general","news","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":"11007e50-9999-5e16-acb6-26b8b01f1bad","slug":"/blog/2015/08/31/jenkins-cia-program-and-meetup-updates/","strippedHtml":"A few years ago, the Jenkins community announced the Jenkins CIA program - the Continuous Integration Ambassador initiative to spread the word of Jenkins.

At JUC and other conferences I especially seek out talks about how others implement their Continuous Delivery processes. At the upcoming JUC West 2015, it is my turn to share “how we did it” at Perforce. I will present my talk \"Continuous Delivery: Driving Lessons” and describe our journey, the rewards we reaped, and the challenges we faced along the way.\n\n+\n+\n\nAt Perforce, we see Continuous Delivery as taking the proven technique of automation and expanding it to a solid set of practices that make the pipeline even more efficient. This includes empowering the product teams to own production and quality all the way from requirements to delivery, and moving from a central build and release team to a self-serve infrastructure to remove the \"friction\" in the workflow. These changes have allowed us to quickly, efficiently and reliably adapt our software in line with user feedback, shifts in the market, and changes to the business strategy.\n\n+\n+\n\nI look forward to seeing you there!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/cisneros_0.preview.jpg[image,width=150,height=224] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Laurette Cisneros, Engineering Tools Manager at Perforce Software.

If this term is new to you, I suggest a quick read of Cloud Native: What it Means and Why it Matters? From my perspective, Cloud Native offers tremendous benefit to enterprise companies, startups and developers looking to add value quickly or capture market share. Cloud Native platforms, such as Cloud Foundry, provide a number of features to reduce the effort of developing software and operating it on or off premise. A few notable features include load balancing, application routing, cluster scheduling, and containerisation. Cloud Native also offers a significant advancement for building integrated pipelines to deliver software. Before we discuss these advancements, let’s consider the role of the container.\n\n+\n+\n\nContainers\n\n+\n\nOne of the most influential components of Cloud Native is the container. At this point, containers are fairly ubiquitous and most developers have experimented or used containers. For instance, if you’ve pushed an application to Cloud Foundry or Pivotal Web Services, you’ve used an container without knowing it.\n\n+\n+\n\nInitially containers were a place to automate the deployment and execution of your code, but over time customization became necessary to handle specific use cases. As a result, container creation now occurs earlier in the development and build phase. As applications are packaged within binaries and containers, validation of the application and container configuration needs to be validated before leaving the developer’s laptop. So what does this mean for the continuous delivery (CD) pipeline?\n\n+\n+\n\nCD Pipelines\n\n+\n\nDevelopers will tell you their role has expanded over the years as agile methodologies have changed the way software is engineered. Techniques like Test Driven Development (TDD) and CD pipelines encourage software teams to deliver higher quality code in every build. Of course, a good CD pipeline starts at the developer’s laptop. Building and testing the start of a pipeline requires the correct tools while preserving the developer’s choice of container.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe diagram below demonstrates a simple CD pipeline. As you can see, the pipeline starts from the developer’s IDE and uses Cloud Foundry’s Lattice to provide a sandbox to validate the delivery artifacts. Lattice, based on Cloud Foundry’s container scheduler, delivers a small Cloud Native Platform that can be scaled up in the cloud or scaled down to a laptop. It includes a cluster scheduler, HTTP load balancing, log aggregation and health management for containers. Best part, it offers developer choice. Lattice provides support for both Docker containers and Cloud Foundry buildpacks.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/omeara-pic_0.png[image,width=600,height=366] +\n\n+\n+\n\nLattice’s flexibility makes it extremely easy to test how the application, which runs in a Docker container, will function in a Cloud Native environment. It’s also extremely helpful for developers engaged in a spike (prototype phase) where they want to push, validate and demonstrate code and let the platform handle the container creation, runtime environment and deployment artifacts via Cloud Foundry buildpacks.\n\n+\n+\n\nExtending the CD pipeline beyond the developer’s laptop to deliver value to the organization will require additional tools like the CloudBees Jenkins Platform, Artifactory and Pivotal Cloud Foundry. These enterprise build-and-deploy solutions help developers deliver to a Cloud Native platform and reduce the time to establish the feedback loop. If the enterprise maintains a Hybrid cloud strategy, these tools make it seamless to deploy across different cloud providers.\n\n+\n+\n\nAs developers build more Cloud Native applications for Cloud Native platforms, it’s important to establish good tool chains and best practices early in the development phase. Interested to see these tools in action? Join us at Jenkins User Conference West on September 2nd to learn how I use these tools to build Integrated Deployment Pipelines with Jenkins and Cloud Foundry.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/OMeara_0.jpg[image,width=145,height=180] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Jamie O’Meara, Field Engineer at Pivotal.

I had not pictured enterprise release managers as plugin developers. Here at Black Duck Software, we developed Jenkins plugins for four years running. Fabrice Solami, a sales engineer, wanted to do more than automate our code scanning tool via a shell script step in the Jenkins job. He wrote a first plugin that added a build step to run the tool and configure the job more comfortably. The plugin became quickly popular, and when customers asked for it to also support maven builds and run on agents, it was time for help from the engineering team, particularly the integration team I lead.\n\n+\n+\n\nOver the years we developed four more plugins and overhauled the original one with the user community (aka paying customers) growing to >75 organizations, mostly large or really large development organizations. In the process, we received lots of feedback and discovered some Jenkins features we feel are essential for good plugin design for the enterprise. Let me share these insights so that you can consider them in your plugin development.\n\n+\n+\n\nCredentials Plugin\n\n+\n+\n\nOur plugins connect to our web applications and need authentication to utilize our SDK. The first plugins used username and password fields in every job configuration. That made tedious configuration work and stores the passwords in clear text in the configuration files on disk. Ouch!\n\n+\n+\n\nWe did wise up and started using the credentials plugin to manage username/passwords centrally and securely. It even allows setting authorization roles in such a way that the maintainer of a job can use the credentials without seeing the password. With that in place, our plugins are fit for banks and insurance companies and any other security-conscious organization.\n\n+\n+\n\nSupport the REST API\n\n+\n+\n\nDid you know that Jenkins talks REST? We found it to be an easy way to create and update jobs. It is a really handy tool. The REST API is easy to script for all sorts of external interactions.\n\n+\n+\n\nHowever, plugins need to do a little effort to support it on their part; yet it is almost trivial to do. So from our experience it should not be left out.\n\n+\n+\n\nWe wrote a small Java program that reads, creates, updates job configurations, and can trigger job runs. It reads the jobs and commits them to a file for easy mass editing and updates the jobs afterwards.\n\n+\n+\n\nOur internal use case is to manage regression tests. We have medium-sized lists of jobs that run regression tests. With this tooling we can create a new set of jobs for a given plugin that runs against a new target server, that is, a server version under QA. It all happens in less than 15 minutes.\n\n+\n+\n\nWe also made this part of our migration from our first plugin to its successor with all the enterprise capabilities, but incompatible configuration. Using the REST API and some more Java programs we can create a csv file / Excel spreadsheet with jobs that are configured with the previous plugin. The user can filter the list with the spreadsheet application as needed, and then use the resulting list as input to the batch upgrade tool. This makes the upgrade a gradual affair and not a tedious exercise in UI configuration changes.\n\n+\n+\n\nUpdateSites Manager Plugin\n\n+\n+\n\nIf you are developing plugins for in-house use, you have the option to install/update those through file upload. However, in an enterprise you likely have multiple Jenkins servers for different divisions, development groups, or regions. The notification of updates becomes tedious at best. Wouldn’t it be nice to run your own update site, so that your plugin(s) become discoverable in the “Available” tab of the “Manage plugins” screen? Wouldn’t it be a dream if available new versions show up automatically in the “Updates” tab, including Jenkins version compatibility check?\n\n+\n+\n\nUpdateSites Manager plugin by IKEDA Yasuyuki is the answer to your prayers. It is easy to install, and the process to create and publish an update site is not too complicated and can become part of your Jenkins job building/releasing the plugin.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn my presentation at JUC 2015 West, I’ll share more details on how this makes a difference and how you can use these techniques to make your plugins enterprise-grade. As a bonus, I’ll show you how to get a free vulnerability report for your Maven or Gradle builds.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/Kandler_0.jpg[image,width=152,height=182] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Kaj Kandler, Integration Manager atBlack Duck Software, Inc.
