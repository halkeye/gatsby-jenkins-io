to announce that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in\nthe Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).\nThis status is officially effective Aug 03, 2020.\nJenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.\nThanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!\n\nIn this article, we will discuss what the CD Foundation membership and graduation mean to the Jenkins community.\nWe will also talk about what changed in Jenkins as a part of the graduation,\nand what are the future steps for the project.\n\nTo know more about the Jenkins graduation,\nsee also the announcement on the CD Foundation website.\nAlso see the special edition of the CD Foundation Newsletter for Jenkins user success stories and some surprise content.\nThe press release is available here.\n\nHow does CDF membership help us?\n\nAbout 18 months ago, Jenkins became one of the CDF founding projects, along with Jenkins X, Spinnaker and Tekton.\nA new foundation was formed to provide a vendor-neutral home for open source projects used for Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration.\nSpecial interest groups were started to foster collaboration between projects and end user companies,\nmost notably:\nInteroperability,\nMLOps and\nSecurity SIGs.\nAlso, a Community Ambassador role was created to organize local meetups and to provide public-facing community representatives.\nMany former Jenkins Ambassadors and other contributors are now CDF Ambassadors, and they promote Jenkins and other projects there.\n\nThanks to this membership we addressed key project infrastructure needs.\nStarting from Jan 2020, CDF covers a significant part of the infrastructure costs\nincluding our services and CI/CD instances running on Microsoft Azure.\nThe CD Foundation provided us with legal assistance required to get code signing keys for the Jenkins project.\nThanks to that, we were able to switch to a new Jenkins Release Infrastructure.\nThe foundation sponsors the Zoom account we use for Jenkins Online Meetups and community meetings.\nIn the future we will continue to review ways of reducing maintenance overhead by switching some of our self-hosted services to equivalents provided by the Linux Foundation to CDF members.\n\nAnother important CDF membership benefit is community outreach and marketing.\nIt helped us to establish connections with other CI/CD projects and end user companies.\nThrough the foundation we have access to the DevStats service\nthat provides community contribution statistics and helps us track trends and discover areas for improvement.\nOn the marketing side, the foundation organizes webinars, podcasts and newsletters.\nJenkins is regularly represented there.\nThe CD Foundation also runs the meetup.com professional account which is used by local Jenkins communities for\nCI/CD and Jenkins Area Meetups.\nLast but not least, the Jenkins community is also represented at virtual conferences where CDF has a booth.\nAll of that helps to grow Jenkins visibility and to highlight new features and initiatives in the project.\n\nWhy did we graduate?\n\nThe Jenkins project has a long history of open governance which is a key part of today’s project success.\nStarting from 2011, the project has introduced the governance meeting which are open to anyone.\nMost of the discussions and decision making happen publicly in the mailing lists.\nIn 2015 we introduced teams, sub-projects and officer roles.\nIn 2017 we introduced the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process which helped us to make the key architecture and governance decisions more open and transparent to the community and the Jenkins users.\nIn 2018 we introduced special interest groups that focus on community needs.\nIn 2019 we have expanded the Jenkins governance board\nso that it got more bandwidth to facilitate initiatives in the project.\n\nSince the Jenkins project inception 15 years ago, it has been steadily growing.\nNow it has millions of users and thousands of contributors.\nIn 2019 it has seen 5,433 contributors from 111 countries and 272 companies,\n67 core and 2,654 plugin releases,\n45,484 commits, 7,000+ pull requests.\nIn 2020 Q2 the project has seen 21% growth in pull requests numbers compared to 2019 Q2, bots excluded.\n\nOne may say that the Jenkins project already has everything needed to succeed.\nIt is a result of continuous work by many community members,\nand this work will never end as long as the project remains active.\nLike in any other industry, the CI/CD ecosystem changes every day and sets new expectations from the automation tools in this domain.\nJust as the tools evolve, open source communities need to evolve so that they can address expectations, and onboard more users and contributors.\nThe CDF graduation process helped us to discover opportunities for improvement,\nand address them.\nWe reviewed the project processes and compared them with the Graduated Project criteria defined in the CDF project lifecycle.\nBased on this review, we made changes in our processes and documentation.\nIt should improve the experience of Jenkins users,\nand help to make the Jenkins community more welcoming to existing and newcomer contributors.\n\nWhat changed for the project?\n\nBelow you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:\n\nPublic roadmap\n\nWe introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.\nThis roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.\nIt makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters,\nand at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.\nThe roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in jep:14[].\n\nMore details about the public roadmap are coming next week, stay tuned for a separate blogpost.\nOn July 10th we had an online contributor meetup about the roadmap\nand you can find more information in its materials\n( slides, video recording).\n\nUser Documentation\n\nJenkins Weekly Release line is now documented on our website ( here).\nWe have also reworked the downloads page and added guidelines explaining how to verify downloads.\n\nA new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.\nThis list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,\nincluding ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.\nPlease do not hesitate to add your company there!\n\nCommunity\n\nWe passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.\nThis certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices\nand to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).\nIt also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.\nDetails are on the Jenkins core page.\n\nJenkins Code of Conduct was updated\nto the new version of Contributor Covenant.\nIn particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.\n\nThe default Jenkins contributing template was updated to cover more common cases for plugin contributors.\nThis page provides links to the Participate and Contribute guidelines hosted on our website,\nand helps potential contributors to easily access the documentation.\n\nThe Jenkins Core maintainer guide was updated to include maintenance and issues triage guidelines.\nIt should help us to deliver quality releases and to timely triage and address issues reported by Jenkins users.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIt an honor to be the first project to reach the graduated stage in the Continuous Delivery Foundation,\nbut it is also a great responsibility for the project.\nAs a project, we plan to continue participating in the CDF activities and to work with other projects and end users to maintain the Jenkins' leader role in the CI/CD space.\n\nWe encourage everyone to join the project and participate in evolving the Jenkins project and driving its roadmap.\nIt does not necessarily mean committing code or documentation patches;\nuser feedback is also very important to the project.\nIf you are interested to contribute or to share your feedback,\nplease contact us in the Jenkins community channels ( mailing lists, chats)!\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nCDF graduation work was a major effort in the Jenkins community.\nCongratulations and

Linux Foundation, along with CloudBees, Google, and a number of other companies, launched a new open-source software foundation called Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF.) The CDF believes in the power of Continuous Delivery, and it aims to foster and sustain the ecosystem of open-source, vendor neutral projects.\n\nJenkins contributors have decided that our project should join this new foundation. This discussion happened over a period of time, with a relatively succinct summary of the motivation comes from here.\n\nNow, as a user, what does this mean?\n\nFirst, there will be no big disruption/discontinuity. The same people are still here, no URL is changing, releases will come out like they’ve always been. We will make the decisions the same way as we’ve been making, and pull requests land the same way. Changes will happen continuously over the period of time.\n\nThis is yet another testament to the maturity and the importance of the Jenkins project in this space. With a quarter million Jenkins running around the globe, it’s truly rocking the world of software development from IoT to games, cloud native webapps to machine learning projects. It makes Jenkins such an obvious, safe choice for anyone seeking open heterogeneous DevOps strategy.\n\nThe CDF creates a level playing field that is well-understood to organized contributors, which further, translate into more contributors, hence resulting in a better Jenkins, faster. Over the past years, the Jenkins project has been steadily growing more structures that provide this clarity, and this is the newest step on this trajectory.\n\nAny serious dev teams are combining multiple tools and services to cover the whole software development spectrum. A lot of work gets reinvented in those teams to integrate those tools together. Jenkins will be working more closely with other projects under the umbrella of the CDF, which would result in better aligned software with less overlap.\n\nOur users are practitioners trying to improve the software development process in their organizations. They get that CI/CD/automation which unlocks the productivity that their organizations need, but that’s not always obvious to their organizations as a whole. So our users often struggle to get the necessary support. The CDF will advocate for the practice of Continuous Delivery, and because it’s not coming from a vendor or a project, it will reach the people who can lend that support.\n\nSo I hope you can see why we are so excited about this!\n\nIn fact, for us, this is an idea that we’ve been cooking for close to two years. I don’t think I’m exaggerating much to say the whole idea of the CDF started from the Jenkins project.\n\nA lot of people have done so much work behind the scene to make this happen. But a few people played such instrumental roles that I have to personally thank them namely, Chris Aniszczyk for his patience and persistence, R. Tyler Croy for cooking and evolving the idea, and Tracy Miranda for bringing this idea into a reality.","title":"Jenkins is joining the Continuous Delivery Foundation","tags":["cdf","general","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/kohsuke.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"cdf","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
