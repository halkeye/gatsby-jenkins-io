We found that some submitted stories were far too big to be constrained by our format of 'background/goal/solution/results.'\n\nSome Jenkins users had a much more complex story to tell, whether it was about getting upper management to buy-in, keeping developers happy, or simply making sure pipelines weren’t just bottlenecks in disguise.\n\nHere are a handful of Jenkins Case Studies we’ve published in the past few months, with many more on the way!\n\nCase Study #1: D4Science\n\nAmping up scientific research with CI/CD powered by Jenkins\n\nTo promote open science practices and support scientific communities while serving 11k registered users in 45 countries, D4Science introduced a new delivery pipeline that replaced their pre-existing build platform.\n\nOf course, they had to build and release their software framework (gCube) in a way that would support multi-project releases at scale — from 200+ Git repositories within the same day! It had to be fast, automate all release activities, and it had to deliver incremental releases to address user requirements quickly. Most of all, the solution had to be cost-effective.\n\nUsing Jenkins, they created an innovative approach to software delivery: a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, scalable, easy to maintain, and upgradable at a minimal cost.\n\nDiscover how D4Science empowers e-Science and virtual research communities with software released via Jenkins. Read the Jenkins case study featuring D4Science here!\n\nCase Study #2: Gainsight\n\nHumanizing CSX with tech innovation and a robust DevSecOps platform\n\nGainsight’s customer service experience platform helps customer success teams at more than 100 leading IT and healthcare clients. How? By driving engagement for tens of thousands of their customers.\n\nThat’s why the engineering team at Gainsight approached the customer experience by building a smarter, faster DevSecOps platform using Jenkins. They stuck to an infrastructure-as-code approach while integrating various tools and programming languages all within the platform. And they secured processes with better visibility and air-tight quality control.\n\nThe result was a flexible DevSecOps infrastructure, 95% of which is scalable with code. And the cost of infrastructure costs was 40% less. That provides Gainsight with ease of collaboration, keener operational insight, and — because builds are 30% faster — the ability to stay a step ahead of the competition.\n\nRead why Gainsight’s lead DevOps engineer, Prudviraj Pentakota, says \"Jenkins is the epicenter of DevSecOps in our organization.\" Get the full story here.\n\nCase Study #3: Avoris Travel\n\nReinventing travel with an inventive technology platform\n\nPart of Barceló Group, Ávoris Travel is behind prominent destination travel brands like LeSki, Le Musik, and a selection of author travels under its \"Viagens Com Assinatura\" signature travel concept. A proprietary database and a smart, dynamic booking engine are the tickets to offering differentiating and inventive travel opportunities.\n\nAlso unique to Avoris is a discreet machining technology that enables agents to enter specific criteria to search and find all types of trips and travel opportunities across the entire network.\n\n\"Our infrastructure is very important because we have to be online to meet customer demand anywhere in the world,\" said Alejandro Alvarez Vazquez, Sysadmin, Avoris Travel. \"Our CI/CD platform is used by 200 people. The services that we build and deploy are used by thousands of potential clients and by our network of 675 own agencies located in Spain and Portugal.\"\n\nRead the case study to learn how the flexibility of Jenkins plugins helped Avoris reduce build times by over 50% and became a go-to, scalable infrastructure supporting 675 agencies and over 2.8 million international consumers.\n\nWhat’s your story?\n\nWe want to know what you’re building with Jenkins and would love to post your case study on our\"Jenkins Is The Way\" website, a global showcase of how developers and engineers build, deploy, and automate great stuff with Jenkins.\n\nThe best way to get started is to share your Jenkins User story with us. We’ll send you a free Jenkins Is The Way T-Shirt in return and publish your account for the entire Jenkins community to see. And if it’s selected for a Case Study, we’ll be in touch for a one-on-one interview!

We invite you to explore them all but wanted to share three inspiring examples highlighting how various organizations approach — and implement — Jenkins in the workplace. Enjoy!\n\nStory 1: Jenkins is the way to tackle any challenge\n\nEnterprise-wide CI/CD solution caters to the complex problems that project teams face each day, as told by Jenkins user Mark Baumann:\n\n“Our development teams work in a wide range of projects and domains. We have a very diverse tooling landscape since the projects work with all kinds of different software tools. Of course, projects in the embedded domain will have different toolsets than those working in the automotive domain.\n\nEach project team created its own CI Toolchain, which caused a lot of work for the developers and the IT department. Each project needed to set up their own virtual machine, install and manage their own CI Server, Version Management, and whatever they needed. Creating such a toolchain could easily take up weeks until it was running because there was no standard solution and each team had to start from scratch.”\n\nDiscover how ITK-Engineering GmbH developed a company-wide, common, internal CI/CD toolchain and increased the number of builds for each project and how nearly all departments are now practicing CI/CD. The full Jenkins / ITK Engineering story is here!\n\nStory 2: Jenkins is the way to add spicy flavors to agency processes\n\nA creative agency start-up simplifies the build, test, and deploy steps, allowing the small team to focus more on the deliverables and less on the process. As told by Jenkins user Erik Woitschig:\n\n“It was quite a challenge to streamline and combine all the services to build an artifact to deploy. Because of our micro service-oriented and distributed architecture, the most challenging part of rethinking our build, test, and deploy process was to figure out how best to sync the deployment of all services. We also had to retest builds properly to go live or initiate a rollback.\n\nWith Jenkins and some pipelines, it was relatively simple to create a local and distributed artifact of our application to quickly share and deploy across the team, locally and globally.”\n\nBecause Jenkins is simple to install and easy to maintain, Muzkat has increased productivity far beyond that of a 3-person team. Read on to learn how this bootstrapped Berlin-based agency is making a go of it with Jenkins. The full Jenkins / Muzkat story is here!\n\nStory 3: Jenkins is the way to focus on your code\n\nAs demands for the Wright Medical’s services grew, they required an agile DevOps environment that would grow and scale along with the tech team, as told by Jenkins user Christophe Carpentier:\n\n“What was critical to our success was the stability of Jenkins and a significant number of reliable plugins! We could take a few plugins, set up our workflow, and add GitLab and SonarQube integration without ever stopping or losing data in over a year. We found that all of the problems we encountered were our own, and that is why it was critical to make Jenkins an essential part of our workflow.\n\nWith this implementation, Jenkins allows more than would be manually possible. It flawlessly updates our staging environments, blocks commits based on the SonarQube analysis, and provides us with near-instant feedback on merge requests.”\n\nLearn how Wright Medical supports a growing dev team by switching to an agile DevOps process that allows for automatic daily releases — versus weekly manual builds. Best of all, it’s letting the developers focus on building great code rather than infrastructure.
