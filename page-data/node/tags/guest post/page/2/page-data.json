Who is it for? What are the highlights of your plugin?* +\n +\n\n+\nA: https://loader.io[Loader.io] is a simple-to-use cloud-based load testing service. The service is designed for developers and people who need to ensure applications are performing as they should. It allows developers to perform large-scale load tests on demand, which lets them understand the scalability and performance of their applications. We realize Jenkins is the preferred build service for a lot of our users, and we know providing a way for them to implement, measure and improve application performance during the continuous build cycle is important. So we wrote a Jenkins plugin that allows load testing to be brought into the continuous build and deployment process with ease. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: Did you have to convince your boss/lawyers to open-source your plugin? What was the pitch?*\n\n+\nA: No, at SendGrid our focus is always to help make developers’ lives easier, and when we can, we like to provide tools that they can hack on. Since the Jenkins platform is itself an open source project, following the same model to provide our plugin made perfect sense. In addition, we encourage others to build on our work, help improve it and ultimately make it better for everyone using it. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: How did you learn how to write a plugin?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: We use the Jenkins platform ourselves, and we leverage a number of the plugins available. Having access to these and the Jenkins documentation gave us a great head start. It was an easy decision to write the Jenkins plugin for loader.io, and the Jenkins community provided both detailed instructions as well as support when we needed it. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: Any gotchas in the experience of developing a plugin that you want to share?\n\n*\n\n+\nA: The overall process of developing the plugin was straightforward and simple, but we did run into some scope creep in the middle of the dev process. We found that since the platform was so easy to write for, it made us keep adding more and more features. Usually this is good, but in the case of our project, we wanted to provide the most value as quickly as possible. So we scaled back, focused on solid execution for the most important features, and are already preparing to launch a new version with the things we reserved for post v1 availability. +\n +\n +\n\n+\nQ: What is the reaction from users so far?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: The users we’ve spoken with love the plugin. In addition we’ve already gotten great feedback from some community members on “nice to have’s” in the plugin, some of which we’re already working on. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: What tips do you share to those who are interested in writing plugins?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: If you have a service that provides value in the build, deployment and post deployment process, then you should be writing a Jenkins plugin. Two things are important for anyone writing a plugin: 1) be sure the plugin you’re writing is going to provide true value (if you need it yourself this is a good sign), and 2) make sure you understand the scope of the project and deliver core features and value first, then focus on some extra things. Providing a valuable plugin sooner than later will help you identify all the right additional features to include, especially when collecting live community feedback. +\n +\n\n+\nSome of the things we focused on early in the process were to identify the core features, and more importantly to make it very easy for users of Jenkins to install, use and interpret the loader.io plugin and results. We wanted to allow users to leverage our plugin for multiple environments and builds with system and global credentials. To do this, we decided to make use of the Credentials plugin (https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin), which is a heavily-adopted plugin that provides a standardized API for plugins to store and retrieve credentials. This plugin allows our users to add and use different credentials in one single Jenkins environment. In addition, we created a new re-run feature which, when used with continuous build and testing, provides a deep view into the performance of an application over time. Finally, we wanted to bring the same UI experience users have in our environment into Jenkins, which we did by preserving the load test report model and making it function the same in the Jenkins UI. Doing this makes it easy for users to have consistency between the UIs and more easily understand the results regardless of where they’re viewing them. +\n +\n\n+\nIt’s very easy to write a Jenkins plugin - I hope these insights will encourage you to write your own. +\n +\n\n+\nps - We’d love your feedback too.

At customer after customer we've seen extreme feedback devices drive significant incremental productivity gains, so about a year ago we started talking about taking the concept mainstream and making it easily available to any development team. So, as a small side-project, we've decided to scratch our own itch and developed an easy-to-deploy, Linux-based, laser-cut, extreme feedback device, specifically designed for Jenkins.

Scientists are arguably even worse off: most of them are not trained as software engineers, yet, in the last decades, creating custom software has become an integral part of virtually any research activity, be it data analysis, simulation or experiments. Frequently, there is a great emphasis on numerical accuracy and reproducibility of results, which requires extensive testing. As a coup de grâce, most publicly funded research projects are running on tight budgets, excluding the possibility of hiring professional contractors to outsource required software development work. +\n +\n\n+\nEnter Jenkins the Butler! +\n +\n\n+\nBack in 2011, Yury V. Zaytsev, a doctoral candidate now working at Jülich Research Center, Germany was supported by a Google Summer of Code stipend to design a continuous integration infrastructure for http://www.nest-initiative.org[NEST], a spiking neuronal network simulator for neuroscientific research released under the GPL license. An overwhelmingly positive experience with this new setup motivated him to write up https://www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/10.3389/fninf.2012.00031/abstract[a case study], which was recently published in \"Frontiers in Neuroinformatics\", an open access scientific journal. +\n +\n\n+\n\"The new CI system boosts our productivity, because it helps us find and fix breakages very quickly, even when they only occur for obscure combinations of configuration options. Automated integration testing is a major breakthrough for NEST, as it ensures that developing new features does not come at the cost of reliability or accuracy\" - said Markus Diesmann, director of the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6) at the Jülich Research Center, Germany and NEST Initiative board member. +\n +\n\n+\nWe hope that through a peer-reviewed publication in a prominent scientific journal we will be able to reach the scientific community more efficiently, as compared to the materials targeting professional software developers. However, we likewise believe that our case study might be of interest to the readers of this blog, especially those who are still only considering implementing continuous integration. +\n +\n\n+\nLastly, we would like to thank all developers and users of Jenkins whose contributions throughout the years made it the versatile and robust continuous integration server it is today!","title":"Neuroscientists embrace continuous integration served by Jenkins","tags":["general","guest post","cia"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","id":"8b87be41-1fcb-53eb-9ced-f72c5ac77bb6","slug":"/blog/2012/11/18/comunidade-verde-amarela-do-jenkins-uni-vos/","strippedHtml":"O Jenkins, servidor de integração favorito de todos, é muito utilizado no Brasil, e agora tem uma lista de e-mails em Português além do primeiro encontro de usuários Jenkins no Brasil.

If you have projects on https://github.com/[GitHub], you can effortlessly log in to BuildHive via GitHub OAuth, import your projects with literally a single click, and start benefiting from the powerful promise of the cloud. You'll no longer have to worry about managing infrastructure, you'll just get all that great Jenkins CI capability for your projects immediately. +\n +\n +\n +\nWith BuildHive enabled projects, if a user of your project creates a pull request, then it will automatically pre-test that request before it hits the master tree -- https://github.com/jenkinsci/naginator-plugin/pull/2#issuecomment-5732481[commenting inside the pull request] whether or not the change broke the build. If a developer wants to test some changes before pushing them to the master tree, there's the https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb[Validated Merge feature], which can be used to screen commits before they land in master. Both of these features are wickedly awesome, to not use them would be a mistake for any F/OSS community. +\n +\nI would encourage you to try out BuildHive, it's already active for most/all of the Jenkins plugins. There's also an existing https://groups.google.com/d/topic/jenkinsci-dev/kqPAOziY1as/discussion[RFC thread] which is in discussion for making this the de facto location for Jenkins plugin on Jenkins testing. Please give it a shot and then post your comments. +\n +\nAside from this major announcement, I think the most interesting perspective I took away from the conference was the sheer diversity of Jenkins exploitation. People are using it on all sorts of hardware platforms, from mobile to cloud, on all sorts of languages from Java and C/C++ to Python and Ruby. I was also impressed with how many teams are using Jenkins as part of their mission critical business process. +\n +\nFinally, I'd like to thank all the Jenkins developers and users for making it the best continuous integration software available today.

Jenkins is here to help!  With the Join Plugin you can do just that.  Over on the confluence page it’s got a number of examples and fancy flow charts.  But the take-away is that if you can describe the flow, you can make it happen.  But you’re saying \"wait, I need to pass information around between the jobs.\"\n\nWe’ve got that one covered for you too with the Parameterized Trigger Plugin.  And here’s the best part, these two can work together!  With both plugins installed you can follow the steps listed in the Build Parameters section of the Join Plugin. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/join_trigger.png\n\nAnd as they say, now you’re cooking with gas!","title":"Building a software diamond with Jenkins","tags":["general","guest post","plugins","tutorial"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
