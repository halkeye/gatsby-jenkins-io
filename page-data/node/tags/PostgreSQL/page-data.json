Please note that the database\nwill not be created by the plugin, the user has to create the database.\n\nConnection Timeout - Set the connection timeout duration in seconds.\n\nSocket Timeout - Set the socket timeout duration in seconds.\n\nCredentials - Configure authentication using username and password to the PostgreSQL instance.\n\nUse the Test PostgreSQL Connection button to verify that the details are correct and Jenkins is able to connect to\nthe PostgreSQL instance.\n\n[IMPORTANT] When configuring the plugin for the first time, it is highly important to press the Perform PostgreSQL\nSchema Initialization button. It will automatically perform schema initialization and create the necessary indexes.\nThe button can also be used in the case the database is wiped out and schema needs to be recreated.\n\nPress the Save button.\n\nNow, all the fingerprints produced by this Jenkins instance should be saved in the configured PostgreSQL instance!\n\nQuerying the Fingerprint Database\n\nDue to the relational structure defined by PostgreSQL, it allows users/developers to query the fingerprint data which\nwas not possible using the Redis fingerprint storage plugin.\n\nThe fingerprint storage can act as a consolidated storage for multiple Jenkins instances.\nFor example, to search for a fingerprint id across Jenkins instances using the file name, the following query could be\nused:\n\nSELECT fingerprint_id FROM fingerprint.fingerprint\nWHERE filename = 'random_file';\n\nA sample query is provided which can be tweaked depending on the parameters to be searched:\n\nSELECT * FROM fingerprint.fingerprint\nWHERE fingerprint_id = 'random_id'\n        AND instance_id = 'random_jenkins_instance_id'\n        AND filename = 'random_file'\n        AND original_job_name = 'random_job'\n        AND original_job_build_number = 'random_build_number'\n        AND timestamp BETWEEN '2019-12-01 23:59:59'::timestamp AND now()::timestamp\n\nThe facets are stored in the database as jsonb.\nPostgreSQL offers support to query jsonb.\nThis is especially useful for querying the information stored inside fingerprint facets.\nAs an example, the Docker Traceability Plugin stores information like the name of Docker images inside these\nfacets.\nThese can be queried across Jenkins instances like so:\n\n>'imageName' = 'random_container';\n\nAt the moment these queries require working knowledge of the database.\nIn future, these queries can be abstracted away by plugins and the features made available to users directly inside\nJenkins.\n\nDemo\n\nExternal Fingerprint Storage Demo\n\nSlide deck\n\nReleases ðŸš€\n\nWe released the 0.1-alpha-1 version for the\nPostgreSQL Fingerprint Storage Plugin.\nPlease refer to the\n\nchangelog for more information.\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin 1.0-rc-3 was also\nreleased.\nThe\n\nchangelog provides more details.\n\nA few API changes made in the Jenkins core were released in Jenkins-2.253.\nIt mainly includes exposing fingerprint range set serialization methods for plugins.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nThe relational structure of the plugin allows some performance improvements that can be made when implementing\ncleanup, as well as improving the performance of Fingerprint#add(String job, int buildNumber).\nThese designs were discussed and are a scope of future improvement.\n\nThe current external fingerprint storage API supports configuring multiple Jenkins instances to a single storage.\nThis opens up the possibility of developing traceability plugins which can track fingerprints across Jenkins instances.\n\nPlease consider reaching out to us if you feel any of the use cases would benefit you, or if you would like to share\nsome new use cases.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe PostgreSQL Fingerprint Storage Plugin and the Redis Fingerprint Storage plugin are maintained by the\nGoogle Summer of Code (GSoC) Team for External\nFingerprint Storage for Jenkins.\nSpecial thanks to Oleg Nenashev,\nAndrey Falko, Mike Cirioli,\nTim Jacomb, and the entire Jenkins community for all the contribution to this project.\n\nAs we wrap up, we would like to point out that there are plenty of future directions and use cases for the externalized\nfingerprint storage, as mentioned in the previous section, and we welcome everybody to contribute.\n\nReaching Out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions, feedback, etc. on the projectâ€™s\nGitter Channel or the\nJenkins Developer Mailing list.\nWe use Jenkins Jira to track issues.\nFeel free to file issues under either the postgresql-fingerprint-storage-plugin or the\nredis-fingerprint-storage-plugin component depending on the plugin.\n\nOther Links\n\nPhase 1 Post\n\nPhase 2 Post\n\nPostgreSQL Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\njep:226[]\n\nGitter Channel\n\nProject Page","title":"External Fingerprint Storage Phase-3 Update: Introducing the PostgreSQL Fingerprint Storage Plugin","tags":["plugins","fingerprint","cloud-native","external-storage","developer","PostgreSQL","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"https://medium.com/@sumitsarinofficial","github":"stellargo","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2020 student.
