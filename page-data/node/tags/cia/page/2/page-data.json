Overall the event was a major success and we’re very happy we were able to take part in it!\n\nFor FOSDEM 2013, we’ll be back in Brussels and participating in a major way. The first day of FOSDEM (February 2, 2013) will be the 2nd birthday for the Jenkins project, and seems appropriate that project founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi will be giving a keynote session titled: \" How we made the Jenkins community \"\n\nHere’s an excerpt from Kohsuke’s talk proposal:\n\nJenkins project has an interesting history. It started from scratch on my spare time, and grow over time to boast 600+ open-source plugins developed by 300+ contributors from all around the world.\n\nThere are several key ingredients, both technical and social, that enabled this model, and I think those ingredients are useful to other projects. In this talk, I’ll discuss how Jenkins project and the community works, what these ingredients are, why they help you attract more developers into your projects, and why it matters.\n\nYou can read more about Kohsuke’s keynote here\n\nIn addition to the keynote, I ( R. Tyler Croy), and a number of members of the Jenkins, Cucumber and Selenium communities are hosting the first ever Testing and Automation devroom at FOSDEM.\n\nIf you’re interested in submitting a talk proposal for the dev room the deadline is 23:59 UTC on December 21st 2012! The Call for Proposals can be found here, and the proposal submission form can can be found here.\n\nWe are very likely going to have a table in the hall again this year, but the FOSDEM committee hasn’t yet confirmed whether or not we will have a table.\n\nRegardless, a lot of Jenkins community members will be at FOSDEM in February in addition to hundreds of other open source contributors and users from around the world.\n\nIf you’re interested in participating and/or meeting up with the Jenkins crowd, there’s details coming together on the FOSDEM wiki page .\n\nWe hope to see you there!","title":"Jenkins keynote at FOSDEM 2013","tags":["general","cia","meetup","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

If you're interested in building an active local Jenkins community, read on to learn how. Really, we can sum it up in one simple step: +\n +\n\nJust Do It!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nAdmittedly more detailed guidelines can be useful, so hopefully these steps will give you a roadmap and some ideas: +\n +\n\n+\nFind an organizer or two. This is probably you. If you can draft a friend, colleague, or random acquaintance or three to help, even better. To enlist additional help in your area, put the word out on the Jenkins Dev email list and on your Twitter account using the hashtag #JenkinsCI.\n\n+\nLet the Jenkins project know. Let us know so that we can help you. We can promote it on the JenkinsCI blog, promote that on Twitter, and post a summary blog. We can send stickers for you to hand out in the meetup, and we can send you a T-shirt for you to wear. We might be even able to find you additional agents I mean helpers in your city. And if you’re recording the event or streaming it live (we can tell you how), the whole Jenkins world may want to know!\n\n+\nDecide how often you want to meet. Once a month is a good frequency, but if you feel like all you can manage is every two months or even every quarter, go for it! You can always change it.\n\n+\nGo to Meetup.com. We have an account that we can let you use, or you can create your own meetup. They make it very easy to manage attendance and also to spread the word to people with similar interests in your community.\n\n+\nDetermine the topic for your first meetup. You could feature a speaker or two, or host a panel discussion, or just get folks together to talk about how you use Jenkins. YOU would probably be a great speaker for your first meetup – or perhaps some of your colleagues or friends. If you prefer to stay behind the scenes, Twitter and the Jenkins Dev list can help you find a speaker too. And as your meetup grows, you’ll have an automatic pool of interested parties.\n\n+\nCome up with a format for the meetup. Here’s an idea for a schedule:\n6-6:30pm: Check in, Networking & Munchies\n6:30-6:35: Announcements\n6:35-7:15: Speaker/panel (can also have 2 speakers, which might go longer)\n7:15-7:30: Q&A\n7:30: Wrap up, chat\n8:00: Say goodnight, or go out together and keep drinking\n\n+\nFind a venue, preferably a free one. Ideally, your company or one you know can host… then the venue is free. Alternate solutions: hotels (which unfortunately cost $$$) or reserve a room at a local bar or restaurant. Sometimes a university or even a library can help out with a free room.\n\n+\nAsk a company or two to sponsor the meetup, which consists of paying for food and drinks for all (and some companies will bring along SWAG). Often the company hosting the venue will also sponsor. Sponsoring is a great way for companies to generate positive publicity in their locale, to get the word out that they’re hiring, and to support the Jenkins community in general.\n\n+\nPlan the room logistics. Consider how you want the room to be set up – theater style or as individual tables to encourage group discussions. Also make arrangements to secure a projector and screen. It’s a good idea to bring along connectors for both Mac and PC.\n\n+\nGet the word out in any way you can. Some ideas:\n\nTell us so that we can promote it through our existing channels.\n\nIf you use Meetup.com, they’ll help get the word out. And as more people join to attend one meetup, they’ll receive word about future meetups too. EventBrite is also good about suggesting events in your area that might interest you.\n\nEmail folks at your company who might be interested\n\nEmail friends and former colleagues and ask them to spread the word\n\nPost the event to your Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn profiles\n\nIf you know of any calendars that highlight local Tech events in your area, post your meetup there. Likewise for any Tech email digests you may receive.\n\n+\n\n+\n +\nAdditional tips: +\n\nGet someone to record the event. Doesn’t have to be professional quality – a Flip cam or SmartPhone can take perfectly usable video (just make sure they can record long enough!). Better yet, stream it live if you can! Broadcasting makes the event accessible to the world, not just your community, and word will travel even farther! As well, future speakers can get an idea for how your group does things.\n\nPlan that ~50% of the people who RSVP won’t make it. It’s a free event, and plans tend to change. Order food and drink accordingly.\n\nRemember that free food and BEvERages are strong motivators! Pizza, giant subs, or other local favorite are great choices. For BEvERages, you’re probably fine with beer, Coke and water.\n\nBring a sign-in sheet and name tags (and pens).\n\nConsider asking the sponsor to bring SWAG or raffle off something cool (maybe even their product or service).\n\nAt the beginning or end of the meetup, ask attendees to suggest topics they want to cover in future meetups. Or have them write down suggestions and put them in a box (then maybe raffle off a prize from the pool of contributors).\n\nVary the format of your meetup – presentation, Birds of a Feather discussion, hackathon, lightning talks, white board night, Jenkins problem-solving session… all of these may interest your audience. If you can, switch the venue as well – that way people get to see other interesting companies, and can also choose to attend meetups that may be more convenient to them.\n\nStart and end on time. If things start to run over, you can always break and let people know they can go if they need to, but are welcome to stay if they like.\n\nJoin forces with other groups when you can – this builds up both of your groups! For example, host a joint Jenkins-Selenium group on the topic of Testing with Jenkins.\n\n+\n +\nStill have questions? https://twitter.com/jenkinsci[Give us a holler]! +\n +\n +\n**Special thanks to our friends at https://www.saucelabs.com[Sauce Labs] for some of this content — they wrote https://sauceio.com/index.php/2011/10/so-you-want-to-start-a-selenium-meetup-group-now-what/[a similar guide] for starting Selenium meetups.","title":"Start Your Own Jenkins Meetup in 10 Easy Steps","tags":["general","cia","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"lisawells","html":"","id":"lisawells","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Lisa Wells","slug":"/blog/author/lisawells","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":"99987b74-9422-5386-abf8-63ce6caba00b","slug":"/blog/2012/08/27/volunteers-needed-for-juc-sf/","strippedHtml":"Recently, Jenkins User Conference organizer Alyssa Tong sent out the following request:\n\nJenkins User Conf SF is looking for volunteers to help us record the\nsessions.

Kinoshita ]\n\nJenkins will be represented at this years Bioinformatics Open Source Conference ( BOSC 2012) on July 13-14th in Long Beach, California. I will be talking about Jenkins during my talk about BioUno.\n\nBOSC 2012 will be held just before ISMB 2012, while registration is through ISMB you don’t have to register for ISMB in order to register for BOSC.\n\nI will be at the event with some Jenkins stickers and available to answer questions you might have about BioUno and Jenkins!\n\nAbout BioUno\n\nBioUno is a project that uses Jenkins as basis for building\nbiology workflows.\nBioUno provides an alternative update center with custom plug-ins for\nbioinformatics tools like\nMrBayes,\nStructure,\nFigtree,\nBeast,\namong others.\n\nWhile the actual task of analysing or displaying data is handled by specific\ntools, that are wrapped by plug-ins, Jenkins is responsible for user control,\nweb interface, notifications, distributed execution, job schedule and\nmanagement, as well as other important low level tasks.\n\nBioUno is similar to BioHPC,\nGalaxy and\nTaverna, in that all these tools enable creating and managing pipelines using different bioinformatics tools.\n\nHowever, as it is using Jenkins, BioUno has the advantage of having an Open Source community of hackers that can answer questions and provide assistance for creating new plug-ins. There is plenty documentation for extending Jenkins\nand troubleshooting issues, as well as plenty existing plug-ins (that can be used as reference while writing new plug-ins).\n\nThere are projects and plug-ins that enable Jenkins to use resources in clouds or turn Jenkins into a Hadoop node, for big data processing. The next steps of the project include the deployment of BioUno to a computer facility, basic infrastructure for BioUno, definition of the process for releasing plug-ins, the creation of more plug-ins and a study on how to handle large data structures, used by many bioinformatics tools.\n\nThe project is being developed by TupiLabs under MIT License, and contributions and new plug-ins are welcome.","title":"Jenkins and Bioinformatics, catch us at BOSC 2012","tags":["general","cia","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
