We’re a little late on mentioning it, but the board has allocated the money to help Jenkins contributors travel to Brussels to participate in FOSDEM and the Jenkins Contributor Summit which we will be hosting the day after, Feb 1st, which we’ll discuss more in a later blog post.\n\nFor the FOSDEM Travel Grant Program, we are able to cover up to $500 (USD) in expenses to help community members participate in FOSDEM.\n\nIf you’re interested, please read the description of the program below. Please note that some of the details of the program are different from the linked grant program page\n\nRegardless we hope to see you all at FOSDEM on January 30th and 31st, 2016, in Brussels!\n\nEligibility\n\nAll community members are eligible for support unless they’ve received a travel grant within the last year (based on the event’s date). However, as we have very limited funds to support this program, we’ll prefer applications by active contributors to the Jenkins project.\n\nIf you have other possible funding sources, please look to them first. This will allow more people to attend a Jenkins community event.\n\nApplication\n\nThe application process for FOSDEM, due to our poor timing, deviates from the traditional Travel Grant Program.\n\nTo apply for a travel grant, send an email with the following information to the Governance Board at jenkinsci-board@googlegroups.com before January 6th.\n\nYour name\n\nThe event you’d like to attend\n\nThe expected cost of travel (airfare, hotel, conference fees, etc.)\n\nA description of your contributions to the Jenkins project, such as:\n\nPlugins you developed\n\nPull requests you authored\n\nDocumentation you wrote\n\nPublic presentations on Jenkins-related topics\n\nWhy should we sponsor your trip?\n\nApplicants Responsibilities\n\nIf you’ve been selected for a travel grant, we’ll expect you to:\n\nBe available for a blog post about this program before the event.\n\nHelp out at the Jenkins stand at FOSDEM\n\nIf your schedule permits, we’d love to see you at the Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit the day after FOSDEM.\n\nIt should go without saying that we expect all Jenkins contributors representing the project at an event such as FOSDEM to act in a respectful and constructive manner. As we have not yet formally adopted our own Code of Conduct, we recommend reviewing the FOSDEM Code of Conduct.\n\nAfter the trip, please submit a travel report to jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list. This report should include the following:\n\nWhat you accomplished at the event\n\nWhat you learned at the event\n\nContacts you made\n\nOther useful information\n\nWe also expect you to submit your receipts via email to the person mentioned in the travel grant confirmation for review. We will reimburse actually incurred costs up to the 500 USD limit.","title":"FOSDEM 2016 Travel Grant Program","tags":["general","cia"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","id":"db5c80d7-2a54-5a76-971c-c77bb53ad0d6","slug":"/blog/2015/11/16/celebrating-hacksgiving/","strippedHtml":"Next week in the US we have a national holiday where, generally speaking, lots of turkey gets converted into left-over turkey sandwiches. For many software developers the Thanksgiving holiday also represents a lull in project schedules, freeing up some time to hack on pet projects or even contribute to open source projects.\n\nTaking a cue from the Adopt a Plugin program that Daniel wrote about earlier this month, we thought it would be fun to organize a \"virtual hackathon\" to coincide with that gap in project schedules. Thus Hacksgiving 2015 was created!\n\nWe’ll be hosting Hacksgiving Nov 23rd and Nov 24 from 7:00PST - 15:00PST (10:00EST - 18:00EST) and would love for you to join! ( RSVP here)\n\nYou don’t need to know Java to help! We will have documentation and design hacking going on as well.\n\nWe have a few goals for Hacksgiving:\n\nIntroduce new contributors to the process of writing code and/or documentation ( documentation hacking details here).\n\nFind some plugins which are up for adoption new maintainers.\n\nClean up or merge some existing plugins which need some care ( listed here).\n\n=== Sessions to note\n\nHere are some of the sessions scheduled that will be hosted by members of community that may interest you:\n\nDay One\n\n7:00PST/10:00EST ( 15-30min) - rtyler will host a welcome and introduction to contribution to the Jenkins project (walking through our contributors guide)\n\n10:00PST/13:00EST ( 60min) - schristou will host a workshop titled \"Introduction to plugin development for Jenkins\"\n\nDay Two\n\n10:00PST/13:00EST ( 60min) - abayer will be hosting a \"Plugin Developer Open Q&A\" session, so bring your questions!\n\nHacksgiving is very unconference structured right now, so if you’re interested in hosting a session please let us know in the #jenkins-community channel or by signing up for a session on the schedule\n\nHow to participate\n\nSince this is a virtual hackathon, we’ll be congregating and chatting in a couple of ways:\n\nOn the #jenkins IRC channel as per usual\n\nWe’ll be hosting sessions and tutorials via Google Hangouts, see the \" hacker hangout * section on the wiki page up to date details\n\nVia the #hacksgiving hashtag on Twitter\n\nYou can also RSVP on our meetup page!\n\nWe hope you can join in the festivities!","title":"Celebrating Hacksgiving!","tags":["general","cia","just for fun"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","id":"e0610191-1961-5c28-92d5-a79db68f7476","slug":"/blog/2015/11/06/october-jams/","strippedHtml":"It is great to see the pick up of local activities through hosted JAMs. In October, the Jenkins community hosted Atlanta JAM and Bay Area JAM.

Scientists are arguably even worse off: most of them are not trained as software engineers, yet, in the last decades, creating custom software has become an integral part of virtually any research activity, be it data analysis, simulation or experiments. Frequently, there is a great emphasis on numerical accuracy and reproducibility of results, which requires extensive testing. As a coup de grâce, most publicly funded research projects are running on tight budgets, excluding the possibility of hiring professional contractors to outsource required software development work. +\n +\n\n+\nEnter Jenkins the Butler! +\n +\n\n+\nBack in 2011, Yury V. Zaytsev, a doctoral candidate now working at Jülich Research Center, Germany was supported by a Google Summer of Code stipend to design a continuous integration infrastructure for http://www.nest-initiative.org[NEST], a spiking neuronal network simulator for neuroscientific research released under the GPL license. An overwhelmingly positive experience with this new setup motivated him to write up https://www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/10.3389/fninf.2012.00031/abstract[a case study], which was recently published in \"Frontiers in Neuroinformatics\", an open access scientific journal. +\n +\n\n+\n\"The new CI system boosts our productivity, because it helps us find and fix breakages very quickly, even when they only occur for obscure combinations of configuration options. Automated integration testing is a major breakthrough for NEST, as it ensures that developing new features does not come at the cost of reliability or accuracy\" - said Markus Diesmann, director of the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6) at the Jülich Research Center, Germany and NEST Initiative board member. +\n +\n\n+\nWe hope that through a peer-reviewed publication in a prominent scientific journal we will be able to reach the scientific community more efficiently, as compared to the materials targeting professional software developers. However, we likewise believe that our case study might be of interest to the readers of this blog, especially those who are still only considering implementing continuous integration. +\n +\n\n+\nLastly, we would like to thank all developers and users of Jenkins whose contributions throughout the years made it the versatile and robust continuous integration server it is today!","title":"Neuroscientists embrace continuous integration served by Jenkins","tags":["general","guest post","cia"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"cia","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":2,"currentPage":1}},
