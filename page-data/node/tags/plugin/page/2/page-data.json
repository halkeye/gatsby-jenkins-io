I was a member of ACM Chapter and Google student developer club of my\ncollege. I am passionate about automation.\n\nProject Summary\n\nThis is a GSoC 2018 project.\n\nThis project aims to develop a pull request Job Plugin. Users should be able to\nconfigure job type using YAML file placed in root directory of the\nGit repository being the subject of the pull request. The plugin should interact with various\nplatforms like Bitbucket, Github, Gitlab, etc whenever a pull request is created or updated.\n\nPlugin detects the presence of certain types of reports at conventional locations,\nand publish them automatically. If the reports are not present at their respective conventional\nlocation, the location of the report can be configured in the YAML file.\n\nMy mentors are\nOleg Nenashev (Org Admin),\nMartin d’Anjou,\nKristin Whetstone,\nJeff Knurek\n\nBenefits to the community\n\nProject administrators will be able to handle pull request builds more easily.\n\nBuild specifications for pull requests can be written in a concise declarative format.\n\nBuild reports will be automatically published to Github, Bitbucket, etc.\n\nBuild status updates will be sent to git servers automatically.\n\nUsers will not have to deal with pipeline code.\n\nIf there will be no merge conflicts or build failures, the PR can be merged into target branch.\n\nPhase 1 blog post\n\nPlease see Phase 1 blog post\n\nImplementations till now\n\nAlpha version of the plugin is released. It supports all features of Multi-Branch Pipeline and offers the following features.\n\nBuild description is defined via YAML file stored within the SCM repo. This plugin\nwill depend on GitHub plugin, Bitbucket plugin, Gitlab plugin if users will be\nusing respective platforms for their repositories.\n\nConversion of YAML to Declarative Pipeline: A class YamlToPipeline\nis written which will load the \"Jenkinsfile.yaml\" and make use of PipelineSnippetGenerator class\nto generate Declarative pipeline code.\n\nReporting of results, only xml report types is supported for now.\n\nUse of Yaml file (Jenkinsfile.yaml) from target branch.\n\nGit Push step: To push the changes of pull request to the target branch. This is implemented\nusing git-plugin, PushCommand is used for this from git-plugin. credentialId,\nbranch name and repository url for interacting with Github, Bitbucket, etc\nwill be taken automatically from \"Branch-Source\" (Users have to fill this\ndetails of branch source in job configuration UI). (You can see\nHow to run the demo)\n\nStepConfigurator: To generate pipeline code for all supported steps in Jenkins. This is using\nJenkins configuration-as-code plugin (JCasC plugin) to configure a particular step object and\nthen that step object is passed to Snippetizer.object2Groovy() method to generate the script of that step.\n\nJenkinsfile.yaml example\n\nFor the phase 1 prototype demonstration, the following yaml file was used.\nNote that this format is subject to change in the next phases of the project,\nas we formalise the yaml format definition.\n\n#  Docker image agent example\nagent:\n label: my_label\n customWorkspace: path_to_workspace\n dockerImage: maven:3-alpine\n args: -v /tmp:/tmp\n\n  tools:\n    maven : maven_3.0.1\n    jdk : jdk8\n\nconfiguration:\n  # Push PR changes to the target branch if the build succeeds.\n  # default value is false\n  pushPrOnSuccess: false\n\n  # Trusted user to approve pull requests\n  prApprovers:\n    - username1\n    - username2\n    - username3\n\nenvironment:\n  variables:\n    variable_1: value_1\n    variable_2: value_2\n\n  # Credentials contains only two fields. credentialId must be present in the Jenkins Credentials\n  credentials:\n    - credentialId : fileCredentialId\n      variable : FILE\n\n      # In user scripts Username and Password can be accessed by LOGIN_USR and LOGIN_PSW\n      # respectively as environment variales\n    - credentialId : dummyGitRepo\n      variable : LOGIN\n\nstages:\n  - name: stage1\n    agent: any\n    steps:\n      - sh: \"scripts/hello\"\n      - sleep:\n          time: 2\n          unit: SECONDS\n      - sleep: 2\n      - junit:\n          testResults: \"target/**.xml\"\n          allowEmptyResults: true\n          testDataPublishers:\n            - AutomateTestDataPublisher\n            - JunitResultPublisher:\n                urlOverride: \"urlOverride\"\n    # Post section for \"stage1\".

Jenkins environment\nis different than Travis and does not always make sense to use configurations\ndefined for other environment in Jenkins. Also maintenance of this is slowed\ndown and last commit for this plugin was on 14 Nov 2016.\nClick here to check.\n\nCodeShip Plugin :\nThis plugin is designed to convert codeship \"steps.yaml\" and\n\"services.yaml\" to scripted pipeline code. This plugin has never been released.\n\nJenkins pipeline builder :\nThis is a external non-Java-based tool, which cannot be easily converted to a Jenkins plugin.\n\nDesign\n\nThis plugin will be developed on the top of the MultiBranch Pipeline plugin.\n\nFor now the plugin is bulding branches and Pull request both using Jenkinsfile.yaml,\nbut this plugin is inclined to use for pull requests. This will be fixed in next coding phase.\n\nThis plugin is following below steps for now:\n\nclone target repo\n\ncheckout to target branch\n\nfetch the source branch\n\nmerge source-branch\n\ncall user call user script to build the repo.\n\npush changes of pull request to target branch\n\npublish test reports\n\nPlugin will start above steps if and only if the pull request is\nmergeable, to avoid merge conflicts while merging the source branch to target\nbranch. Pull request’s payload contains information if the pull request changes\nare mergeable or not hence, the pull request is mergebale or not can also be\ndecided by the payload of webhook also.\n\nHow to run the Plugin\n\nSee How to run the demo\nand set credentials, owner and repository on your own and you will be good to go.\n\nExample branch-source configuration.\n\nPhase 1 features\n\nUsers are able to select the Jenkinsfile.yaml file as the source for the Pipeline configuration.\n\nGit Push step\n\nharvest results and reports (and post in the pull request)\n\njunit()\n\nfindbugs()\n\narchiveArtifacts()\n\nBasic interface to parse and get build specifications from YAML file.\n\nThings decided\n\nTo build the plugin on the top of multibranch pipeline plugin. As that plugin has implementation of\n\nNice interface to show different branch and pull requests build separately with use of suitable plugins like Github, Bitbucket.\n\nDetect trusted revisions in a repository.\n\nPublishing of build status to the repository.\n\nConvert the YAML configuration to declarative pipeline.\n\nUser will provide path to the script relative to the root directory of the repository\nwithout extension (.sh or .bat) in the YAML file. The plugin will generate pipeline script to detect the\nplatform and call .sh or .bat script.\n\nExample:\n  Path provided: ./scripts/hello\n  a. On UNIX machine “./scripts/hello.sh” will be called\n  b. On non-UNIX machine “./scripts/hello.bat” will be called.\n\nImplementations till now\n\nA first prototype of the plugin is ready. It supports all features of Multi-Branch Pipeline and offers the following features.\n\nBuild description is defined via YAML file stored within the SCM repo. This plugin\nwill depend on GitHub plugin, Bitbucket plugin, Gitlab plugin if users will be\nusing respective paltfroms for their repositories.\n\nBasic conversion of YAML to Declarative Pipeline: A class YamlToPipeline\nis written which will load the \"Jenkinsfile.yaml\" and make use of PipelineSnippetGenerator class\nto generate Declarative pipeline code.\n\nReporting of results.\n\nPlugin is using Yaml from target branch right now. (Maybe this needs some discussion, example:\nwhat if pull request contains changes in Jenkinsfile.yaml)\n\nGit Push step: To push the changes of pull request to the target branch. This is implemented\nusing git-plugin, PushCommand is used for this from git-plugin. credentialId,\nbranch name and repository url for intracting with Github, Bitbucket, etc\nwill be taken automatically from \"Branch-Source\" (Users have to fill thes\ndetails of branch source in job configuration UI). (You can see\nHow to run the demo)\n\nJenkinsfile.yaml example\n\nFor the phase 1 prototype demonstration, the following yaml file was used.\nNote that this format is subject to change in the next phases of the project,\nas we formalise the yaml format definition.\n\nagent:\n    dockerImage: maven:3.5.3-jdk-8\n    args: -v /tmp:/tmp\n\ntestResultPaths:\n    - target/surefire-reports/*.xml\n\nfindBugs: target/*.xml\n\nstages:\n    - name: First\n      scripts:\n        -   ./scripts/hello\n    - name: Build\n      scripts:\n        -   ./scripts/build\n    - name: Tests\n      scripts:\n        -   ./scripts/test\n\narchiveArtifacts:\n    - Jenkinsfile.yaml\n    - scripts/hello.sh\n\nFrom the yaml file shown above, the plugin generates the following pipeline code:\n\npipeline {\n  agent {\n    docker {\n      image 'maven:3.5.3-jdk-8'\n      args '-v /tmp:/tmp'\n      alwaysPull false\n      reuseNode false\n    }\n  }\n  stages {\n    stage('First') {\n      steps {\n        script {\n          if (isUnix()) {\n            sh './scripts/hello.sh'\n          } else {\n            bat './scripts/hello.bat'\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    stage('Build') {\n      steps {\n        script {\n          if (isUnix()) {\n            sh './scripts/build.sh'\n          } else {\n            bat './scripts/build.bat'\n          }\n        }pipeline\n      }\n      post {\n        success {\n          archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar'\n          archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'Jenkinsfile.yaml'\n          archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'scripts/hello.sh'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    stage('Tests') {\n      steps {\n        script {\n          if (isUnix()) {\n            sh './scripts/test.sh'\n          } else {\n            bat './scripts/test.bat'\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      post {\n        success {\n          junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'\n        }\n        always {\n          findbugs pattern: 'target/*.xml'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPipeline view in Jenkins instance\n\nCoding Phase 2 plans\n\nDecide a proper YAML format to use for Jenkinsfile.yaml\n\nCreate Step Configurator for SPRP plugin.

Arguably this could\ndeserve a retroactive JEP, though I would rather fold it into a JEP for\nJENKINS-49651 (see below).\n\nAs of Jenkins 2.118, or plugin parent POM 3.7, you can mark any Java member\n( class, method, constructor, field, or I suppose also interface,\nenum, or annotation) with API visibility ( protected or public) with an\nannotation :\n\n@Restricted(Beta.class)\n\nThe idea is to announce to potential users of the member that the API\nmay still be in flux and only code prepared to keep up should be using\nit. For an example, 2.118 added a VirtualFile.toExternalURL() method\nthat is being implemented in artifact-manager-s3 and (pending some\nPR merges) called in copyartifact and workflow-basic-steps. We do\nnot necessarily want this to be called yet by unknown parties out\nthere in the Jenkins ecosystem. To enforce that, any attempt to call\nor implement toExternalURL will produce a build failure, unless you\nadd this property to your plugin POM, as these plugins have done:\n\ntrue\n\nWhy? Because there is a chance the design is wrong and it might need\nto be changed—perhaps some upcoming bug fix would demand a boolean\nparameter be added, for example.\n\nUnder the conventional notion of Jenkins API deprecation and compatibility\npolicy, once an API like this makes it into a release version, that is it—we\nmight mark it @Deprecated but we need to maintain compatibility indefinitely,\nand find some way to migrate existing implementations / call sites.\n\nWith the @Beta annotation, that promise is not being made. If it needs\na boolean parameter for some reason, that will be added and those\nthree plugins updated to match; we are not going to bother retaining\nthe original overload and somehow delegating to the new one. This\nsimplification of the developer workflow is important to the use cases\nof Essentials (JEP-3xx), and I would expect the useBeta mark to\nbecome widespread among plugins included in Essentials. Such as the situation\nwhere one team needs to feel\ncomfortable refactoring code under its aegis freely, and the refactored result\nshould be deliverable as a unit to production via the Evergreen distribution\nsystem.\n\nSo that leaves two important questions:\n\nFirst, is the annotation\npermanent, and if not, when should it be removed? I do not think there\nis any hard policy, but the intention is that it should be removed\nonce the API is in more or less widespread use and has held up. For\nthis example, if people start using S3 artifacts, and especially if\nsomeone successfully writes an implementation of artifact storage in\nAzure that uses the API, the concept will have been reasonably proven.\nAt that point we want the API to be used wherever it would make sense,\nand if there is some very belated realization that the design is not\nquite right, we accept the burden of deprecating the original and\nmigrating callers compatibly.\n\nSecond, it is fine and well to say that someone changing the signature\nof a beta toExternalURL is on the hook to update the three plugins\nusing it, but what if a Jenkins admin ( not running Essentials, for\nshame) upgrades to (say) Jenkins 2.125 with the new signature but\ndeclines to accept the updates to those plugins (say,\nworkflow-basic-steps 2.9) which adapt to the change? It is not\nenough to say that it is their fault for holding back on the updates\narbitrarily; the plugin manager offers you updates but does nothing\nto tell you when they are required, so suddenly throwing\nNoSuchMethodError is not a helpful response.\n\nThe solution needs to be ironed out, but my expectation is to use\nJENKINS-49651\nfor this. For example, workflow-basic-steps 2.8,\nusing toExternalURL(), would have declared itself compatible with\nJenkins-Version: 2.118, and thus implicitly anything newer. The\ndeveloper doing the refactoring would also amend some 2.125 (and\nnewer) core metadata to say that it conflicts with anything older than\nthe 2.9 release of the plugin. The plugin manager would therefore\nblock the 2.8 plugin from even being loaded on the 2.125 core; the\nadmin would need to update before using it.

Therefore it’s possible to have a bunch of them over the entire lifetime after the plugin installing the plugin.\n\nOn demand bundles: These bundles are generated from the root \"Support\" action.\n\nHowever current support-core plugin is not much user friendly. The object of this project is to make it more user friendly by adding some features which make a sophisticated environment for the user who use support plugin.\n\nIn this project scope, there are three features and improvements we are going to consider.\n\nEase the bundles management by the administrator ( JENKINS-33090)\n\nAdding an option to anonymize customer labels (strings created by the user such as name of a job, folder, view, agent, and template etc). ( JENKINS-33091)\n\nAllowing user to create an issue and submit a bundle into the OSS tracker using the support-core plugin. ( JENKINS-21670)\n\nArnaud Héritier and Steven Christou are guiding me through the project as my mentors.\n\nTasks and Deliverables\n\nEase the bundles management by the administrator.\n\nUnder this task, the following functions are going to be implemented.\n\nListing bundles stored on the jenkins instance with their details.\n\nAllowing user to download each bundle.\n\nAllowing user to delete each bundle or all bundles.\n\nAllowing user to browse the content of each bundle.\n\nAutomatically purging old bundles.\n\nEnabling user to create an issue and submit a bundle into the OSS tracker\n\nWhen a Jenkins user sees an issue, he/she commonly contacts his support contacts (Jenkins instance admins) and then Jenkins admins troubleshoot the issue.\nThe objective of this task is to implement a feature which enables the user to report an issue to a admin through support core plugin.\n\nWhen creating bundles to attach with the ticket, it is important to protect the privacy of the user who creates the ticket. When considering doing that, anonymizing user created labels (texts) comes to the front.\n\nAdding  an option to anonymize customer labels\n\nThe following functions will be implemented under this taks.\n\nCreating randomized tokens for labels created by users.\n\nProducing a mapping for those labels.\n\nSubstituting encoded labels into all the files included in the support bundle.\n\nWhen creating randomized tokens, it would be much useful and effective if we can create those tokens in a way they make sense to humans. (i.e. readable to humans). For that, I am hoping to use a suitable java library to create human friendly random tokens. One of such libraries is wordnet-random-name.\n\nHowever in order to substitute randomized tokens, all files included in the bundle should be read. This can become inefficient when bundle consists of large number of files.  Therefore it’s important to follow an optimized method for this task.\n\nReferences\n\nInitial proposal of the project\n\nProject repository","title":"GSoC Project Intro: Support Core Plugin Improvements","tags":["core","gsoc","plugin","support-core"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"minudika","html":"","id":"minudika","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Minudika Malshan","slug":"/blog/authors/minudika","twitter":"minudika"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"plugin","limit":8,"skip":8,"numPages":2,"currentPage":2}},
