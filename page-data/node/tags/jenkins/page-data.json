Fond of agility, I‚Äôm part of the organization committee of the Agile Tour Bordeaux since 2020.\n\nI also like to engage in sporting challenges: I swam across the Garonne (a big river in the south of France) and finished 2 triathlons.\nKeeping the best for the end: I‚Äôm the mother of two kids who taught me it‚Äôs possible to speak about Pokemon with one, while drawing a unicorn with the other.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nDuring my studies, I met quite a lot of ‚Äúnerds / geeks‚Äù contributing to Linux distributions (Gentoo & Debian).\nTheir technical skills seemed higher than mine and the Open Source universe looked inaccessible to me.\nConcerning Jenkins, I am a user (now contributor) of it, but not an administrator.\n\nWhat motivated you to participate in that hackathon?\n\nI dared to participate thanks to the Duchess (and mainly Ang√©lique, thanks to her).\nHaving the support and backing of the community was my motivation.\n\nWhat will you remember from this experience?\n\nFrom a professional point of view, I perfected my knowledge of Git, and I had a chance to overview part of the quality processes from Open Source projects.\nMy first Pull Request was approved by‚Ä¶ 9 people!\nThe fourth reviewer did find an issue.\nWho can tell me code review isn‚Äôt useful now?\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I remember two things.\nThe first one: Open Source communities are not elitist communities.\nEvery contribution matters, even small ones.\nThe people I met were positive and benevolent.\nThe second one could be illustrated by a quote from Grace Hopper: ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a good idea, go ahead and do it. It‚Äôs much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.‚Äù.\n\nDo you have anything more to say?\n\nAfter Jenkins, I also submitted Pull Requests to others Open Source projects.\nThe problem: with such a diversity of Open Source projects, how to organize your time?\n\nAnne-Laure Gaillard contributions during hacktoberfest\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5779\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5785\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5804\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5806\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5807\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5808\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5822\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5823\n\nhttps://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/pull/25\n\nhttps://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/pull/23\n\nhttps://github.com/sarequl/Netflix-Helper/pull/6\n\nBertha Torres Interview\n\nTwitter: @tatoberres\n\nLinkedIn\n\nHello Bertha, can you introduce yourself?\n\nComing from a literature training and as a language teacher for more than 15 years, it‚Äôs while moving to a high mountain area that a need to explore other skills set in.\n\nThus, a self-taught training followed by a validated file for financing diploma training followed one another and confirmed to me that life is too short to waste it on what does not make sense to us.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nParticipating in Open Source appeared to me in that exploratory process like a learning opportunity‚Ä¶\nwhich I thought was inaccessible of course! I didn‚Äôt see myself writing code.\n\nBut thanks to the Duchess France community, I learned how to contribute at my level and to understand the contribution process.\nIt‚Äôll allow me as things progress to contribute in more domains.\n\nCan you tell us how the woman version of Jenkins was born?\n\nWell‚Ä¶ In the presentation video for Hacktoberfest, the artwork was mentioned ( https://www.jenkins.io/artwork/) and Ang√©lique also mentioned it during the first meeting‚Ä¶\nAnd one must admit that looking at it, you can see a lot of different things but women.\n\nSo I imagined a governess, very confident, efficient, very clever, scrupulously combed, nicely dressed, who might represent the personality of what Jenkins is made of.\n\nDo you have anything to add?\n\nThis time I was able to participate through Pull Requests related to translation and drawing. I‚Äôll probably do it again!\n\nBertha Torres contributions during hacktoberfest\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/4627\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5796\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5797\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/214\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/215\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ant-plugin/pull/78\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ant-plugin/pull/77\n\nPauline Iogna‚Äôs Interview\n\nTwitter: @pauline_io\n\nHello Pauline, can you introduce yourself?\n\nI‚Äôm a backend developer in Java/Scala, and an active member of Duchess France.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nI didn‚Äôt really have an opinion about Jenkins before doing the hackathon.\nLike many other people, I‚Äôm a Jenkins user but I didn‚Äôt know its source code.\n\nWhat motivated you to participate in this hackathon?\n\nActually participating in Hacktoberfest.\nJust bringing a contribution, even modest, on an open source project.\n\nWhat did you discover through that hackathon?\n\nTechnically, I discovered how to do MVC with Apache Jelly.\nI also rediscovered the contribution process of Open Source projects.\n\nThe Hacktoberfest mechanism is really well thought out for onboarding people wanting to start working on Open Source projects.\nWith Ang√©lique‚Äôs help on top of that to animate sessions on the Duchess France Slack channel, we had the best conditions to contribute to that important project.\n\nWhat will you remember from this experience?\n\nIt‚Äôs not that simple to contribute to a project you‚Äôre just discovering, it requires a bit of investment and patience.\nOn Jenkins, the contributors are really reactive and the Pull Requests are quickly reviewed.\nThe feedback is useful and benevolent.\nThere is one Jira project listing all the features and bugs to be worked on for the project.\nSome tickets are flagged as ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù allowing those who are beginners to pick easily and quickly doable tickets.\n\nPauline Iogna contributions\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5835\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5793\n\nA few words about the organization within Duchess France\n\nThe framework was intentionally simple and flexible. We started with an online kick start meeting for describing a bit of context, and more precisely the Jenkins universe.\n\nOnline kick start meeting for context\n\nThen, we mainly exchanged through the Duchess Slack channel in an asynchronous way on a dedicated channel, as well as a 30 minutes meeting each Friday during October.","title":"Interview of Duchess contributors for hacktoberfest 2021 on Jenkins","tags":["jenkins","hacktoberfest","developer","newcomer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/19e71/ajard.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/77b35/ajard.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/d4a57/ajard.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/19e71/ajard.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/68974/ajard.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/ef6ff/ajard.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/8257c/ajard.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/6766a/ajard.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/22bfc/ajard.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"aHenryJard","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Ang√©lique is a software developer since 2006, Jenkins user since ever and plugins developer since 2019.

bundles Guava, a core Java library from Google.\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.320 (released on November 10, 2021), Jenkins has upgraded the Guava library from\n11.0.1 (released on January 9, 2012) to\n31.0.1 (released on September 27, 2021).\nPlugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nUse the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\n\nMotivation\n\nMany security-conscious organizations using, or planning to use, Jenkins run off-the-shelf security scanners to look for known vulnerabilities.\nThese commonly flag the obsolete Guava library as susceptible to a serialization-related vulnerability ( CVE-2018-10237) and recommend upgrading.\nWhile Jenkins uses JEP-200 to form an explicit list of allowed classes for deserialization,\nand the two Guava classes affected by CVE-2018-10237 are not and will never be added to the list,\nit is time-consuming for the security team to respond to purported security reports\nand for users to justify exemptions from policy to use Jenkins anyway.\n\nFurthermore, the decade-old version of Guava has long been a maintenance burden for Jenkins developers.\nIn a world where Dependabot offers upgrades to libraries released just hours before,\nit is unpleasant to be working with dependencies that are many years old.\n\nFor more information, see JEP-233.\n\nUpgrading\n\nThe vast majority of plugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nJenkins users need only upgrade plugins to compatible versions as documented in the \"Released As\" field in Jira.\nIt is critical to use the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\nFailure to upgrade plugins to compatible versions may result in ClassNotFoundException, NoClassDefFoundError, or other low-level Java errors.\n\nReporting issues\n\nIf you find a regression in a plugin, please file a bug report in Jira:\n\nOpen JEP-233 issues\n\nWhen reporting an issue, include the following information:\n\nUse the JEP-233 label.\n\nProvide the complete list of installed plugins as suggested in the bug reporting guidelines.\n\nProvide the complete stack trace, if relevant.\n\nProvide steps to reproduce the issue from scratch on a minimal Jenkins installation; the scenario should fail when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.320 or later and pass when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.319 or earlier.\n\nIf you maintain a Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nthen please check if there is a pull request awaiting merge or release.\nIf you use an unmaintained Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nconsider stepping up and adopting the plugin to release a compatible version.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe expect to see a bit of disruption from these changes\nbut hope that in the long run they will save time for core and plugin developers\nand lead to a more secure and stable tool.\nPlease reach out on the developers' list with any questions or suggestions.","title":"Guava library upgrade (breaking

are many ways to set up your Jenkins environment, and depending on the configuration you choose, there are different best practices and options to optimize your environment.\nIn this blog, I‚Äôm going to focus on Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees as a way to fine-tune your environment.\nIt‚Äôs a free tool that can help administrators understand and manage their Jenkins controller.\nIf you‚Äôre a CloudBees customer, the tool automatically comes with CloudBees CI.\nHowever, it‚Äôs also available as a free open source tool to anyone who uses Jenkins.\nThe Jenkins Health Advisor tool can make your life easier, because it can arm you with the information you need to keep your Jenkins environment running smoothly.\n\nA Bit of Background\n\nThe CloudBees support team originally created the tool as a way to help customers troubleshoot Jenkins issues.\nWith the tool, our support engineers could gather information from a customer‚Äôs Jenkins controller about the configuration of the controller and agents, the operating system, stats from web requests, and the like.\nOur tech support teams used this data to help customers pinpoint problems, such as security vulnerabilities, performance problems, and plugin version issues.\nVery quickly, our support tooling team saw the bigger-picture benefits of the diagnostic tool as an opportunity for people to proactively manage their controller.\nWith that bit of background, let‚Äôs dive into the Jenkins Health Advisor tool so you understand how it can help you.\n\nThe Problem ‚Äî Lack of Visibility into Controller Environment\n\nBecause of the open-source nature of Jenkins and the vast array of plugins that you can deploy in your Jenkins installation, downstream code changes to plugins and corresponding dependencies can inadvertently impact your environment, which slows productivity, causes confusion, and impacts the quality of your software delivery.\nWhen problems arise, Jenkins administrators need to quickly pinpoint the root cause of an issue, and that can be quite a challenge.\n\nThe Solution ‚Äî Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees\n\nWhen an issue arises, you need razor sharp insight to help you quickly sift through lines upon lines of data about your Jenkins controller and your plugins to identify the problem.\nAnd, that‚Äôs exactly what Jenkins Health Advisor does.\nIt gives you specific information about potential problems in your environment so you can resolve issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen you first install the Jenkins Health Advisor tool in your environment, you‚Äôll receive a report that lists everything it detects in your system.\nYou‚Äôll then receive report emails only when something changes that could impact your environment or when the tool identifies an issue that could be problematic.\nIf there are no issues in your environment, you don‚Äôt receive an email.\nIt‚Äôs really that simple.\n\nThe Power is in the Insight ‚Ä¶ and the CloudBees Support\n\nOk, so let‚Äôs explain how Jenkins Health Advisor uses data to help you optimize your environment.\nThe tool actually generates a support bundle every 24 hours.\nWe don‚Äôt want to bog down your email inbox with redundant reports emails, so we don‚Äôt send every report to you‚Äîonly the reports that indicate an issue with your environment.\nHowever, CloudBees receives every support bundle from every user.\nWe are constantly monitoring all of this active Jenkins controller data with external Jenkins and open source data about known issues, plugin updates, security vulnerabilities, etc.\nIf the Jenkins Health Advisor tool identifies an issue that could impact your system, you‚Äôll receive an email so you can proactively address the problem.\nAt the same time, CloudBees engineering teams are continually working to enhance the detection capabilities of the Jenkins Health Advisor tool, so you can work as proactively as possible to manage your environment.\n\nThe emails you receive identify potential problems, and they also include supporting information to help you resolve issues, with links to solutions and recommended resolutions as well as articles to understand the problem.\n\nHelpful Tips to Gain Value from Jenkins Health Advisor\n\nImprove Troubleshooting\n\nIf you need to troubleshoot a particular issue, you can manually generate a support bundle to give you point-in-time information on your environment.\nYou can filter the support bundle data on different system parameters, like the build queue, dump agent export tables, and garbage collection logs, so you get the specific information you need.\n\nGenerate Anonymized System Data\n\nAt any time, you can change the settings on your tool to anonymize the data in your support bundles.\nYou may want to do this if you don‚Äôt want to share sensitive project data with CloudBees.\nOur support and engineering teams can still gain valuable insight from your generic system data.\nThis is also a helpful feature if you need to share system data with a partner or vendor, and you don‚Äôt want to share project or personnel data.\n\nJenkins Health Advisor Tool Updates and Support\n\nAs we mentioned above, the CloudBees support tooling team is constantly working to enhance the tool.\nTo ensure it‚Äôs always as current as possible, we release updates to the tool every two weeks.\nUsually these updates won‚Äôt impact your Jenkins environment.\nHowever, if there are changes to the tool that might affect your system, you‚Äôll receive a notification email so there are no surprises.\nAnd, if you need help with the Jenkins Health Advisor tool, our support engineers are available to answer your questions.\n\nStart Using Jenkins Health Advisor Today\n\nGiven the vast Jenkins community, it‚Äôs impossible to know everything that may impact your environment, even if you look at your control panel every day and scour open source forums on a regular basis to stay on top of new issues and vulnerabilities.\nThe Jenkins Health Advisor tool is designed to streamline the work effort of your daily routine by automatically telling you when there‚Äôs an issue that may impact your Jenkins environment.\nWith the proactive Jenkins Health Advisor notifications, you can spend your time on more strategic tasks.\n\nInstall the plugin and enroll your controller with

is a CI/CD solution and as such, it is critical that the open source plugins that constitute an integral part of it don‚Äôt expose the systems they are used on to any security risks and vulnerabilities.\nIt is in that context that we worked as an audit/code review team to track and report such flaws and problematic practices.\n\nWe worked in collaboration with Jenkins Security team member Wadeck Follonier, as part of an end-of-study project during our last year of the Master‚Äôs Degree - Reliability and IT Security in the university of Aix-Marseille.\n\nProject Goals\n\nThe main goal of this project was to allow us to discover and work on diverse security vulnerabilities in the context of a widely-used software solution, and in order to achieve that we had to separate the project in multiple other goals:\n\nLearning about some of the most common vulnerabilities and the form in which they can be found on a Jenkins Instance and its plugins.\n\nPerforming code review and technical audit on the application, and compiling our results as part of a security team.\n\nReporting our findings to the Jenkins team and the plugin maintainers, while sometimes helping the latter to correct these vulnerabilities.\n\nKnowledge Sharing\n\nAt the beginning of the project, we set up communication channels with our mentor through Slack and Google Meets, and agreed to schedule weekly sessions with him.\nThe goal of these sessions was both to teach us more about the functionalities of Jenkins and the types of vulnerabilities we would encounter, and to allow us to ask more specific questions regarding our findings.\n\nThanks to our mentor developing a mock plugin compiling a variety of classic vulnerabilities and several of their implementations, including server side request forgery ( SSRF), cross site scripting ( XSS), and XML external entity ( XXE) attacks, we have been able to learn through practice.\nIt allowed us to analyze the context of the code and the different ways the Jelly framework can be used to display information, expanding our payload options and giving us a clearer view of the patterns to look for during our code reviews.\n\nWe have also had the opportunity to learn about the process used to report the vulnerabilities to the maintainers through Jira issues, and some ways we could correct them or provide steps to do so.\n\nSearching and compiling\n\nAt first, we decided to work as a pretty loose team, with each member working on a different plugin and regrouping our findings to confirm or reject them, while staying in constant contact to ask each other questions.\nThis allowed us to broaden the scope of our searches, and is the reason why we have been able to find a larger number of vulnerabilities, in plugins that differed widely in popularity, than we would have working together from the start.\n\nWe used a single file to compile the plugins we audited and our findings, making it easier for our mentor to review them and give us feedback.\nPinpointing the specific portion of code causing the issue and providing reproduction steps as clear as we could proved useful for the reporting process, thus making the approval and correction faster.\n\nDuring the last third of this project, we began to work together on bigger plugins, in order to have more points of view reflecting on the same problem.\nWith different analyses, we were able to come up with new payloads, and sometimes with new vulnerabilities where we only found one separately.\n\nReporting and correcting the vulnerabilities\n\nAll of the reporting was done through Jira issues, which allows the Jenkins team to centralize and triage the vulnerabilities.\nOnce we provided the necessary information, along with the reproduction steps we had, a member of the Jenkins security team contacted the plugin maintainer and guided them through the next steps of the process, with hope that they would answer.\n\nWe have also tried to make the maintainers' job easier, working on some fixes.\nTo achieve this, we delved not only into the functionalities of the vulnerable plugins, but also into some mitigation processes that we found either in the Jenkins documentation,  or with the help of our mentor.\n\nEach one of our modifications has been tested locally, in order to assess whether the vulnerability was still present, and whether no function had been altered.\nHowever, some of the plugins we audited demanded more complex fixes, due to their intrinsic logic, or the thought process of their developer, which led to us being unable to provide a clear fix.\n\nConsidering this, the fixes we have been able to bring into light were only suggestions to the maintainers, for them to use as inspiration or template, in order not to interfere with the plugin logic.\n\nConclusion\n\nThrough this project, we have been able to work as a team, delving into some of the different issues that security engineers are bound to face, and the ways they have at their disposal to mitigate them.\nThis has allowed us to complement our studies with a more practical aspect, that we couldn‚Äôt have had otherwise, and to transition into the companies we are now interns in.\nThis experience has strongly encouraged us to improve in and document ourselves on this branch of cybersecurity, which will have a significant impact on our professional future.\n\nUseful links\n\nJenkins - 2021/03/30 Security Advisory - 5 from us\n\nJenkins - 2021/05/11 Security Advisory - 4 from us\n\nJenkins - 2021/05/25 Security Advisory - 3 from

desire to learn new things, new tricks.\nTheir curiosity helped them to find numerous vulnerabilities that already led to 14 published CVEs.\nThe experience was great and I wish them all the best for their professional career and their never ending quest for knowledge.\n\nIf you are student, intern, or just someone really interested in security and Jenkins in particularly, please reach out to us

up with our goal to clean up some of the technical debt inside Jenkins Core and reduce the maintenance overheads, we are happy to report we were able to remove a long-deprecated Apache Commons Digester library.\n\nJenkins Core does not depend anymore on Apache Commons Digester v.2.1, a version that has been released in 2010.\n\nSome plugins will require update to operate properly after the Jenkins core upgrade.\nSee JEP-231 for the full list of the affected plugins.\nBelow there is the list of plugins that did not have their fix released at the time of writing.\nThey will start to break

addition to these still-served plugins, a few others will break.\nNote however that these were already suspended [ 1 ] for various reasons, so we do recommend to move away from using them or step up as maintainers.\nThe IDs for these plugins are: tfs, svn-release-mgr, cpptest, cflint, script-scm, rtc.\n\nIt is always a good idea to update all your plugins before upgrading Jenkins core.\n\nPlease reach out on the developers‚Äô list with any questions or suggestions.\n\nGetting fixes in the affected plugins\n\nFor all affected plugins we have submitted pull requests with compatibility patches.\nThese plugins seem to have no active maintainer, and hence we cannot commit on delivering those fixes.\nIn mean time you can build a custom patch locally to resolve the issue on your instances.\nIf you use any of those plugins, consider stepping up and adopting them so that the fixes could be released.\nWe will appreciate any contributions!\n\nResources\n\nPR-5320\n\nremoving commons-digester:2.1.\nThis also contains a complete list of impacted plugins and their PRs and statuses.\n\nJEP-231\n\ndescribing this change.\n\n1. this means these plugins are not served anymore by
