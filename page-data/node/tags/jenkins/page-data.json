Guava, a core Java library from Google.\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.320 (released on November 10, 2021), Jenkins has upgraded the Guava library from\n11.0.1 (released on January 9, 2012) to\n31.0.1 (released on September 27, 2021).\nPlugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nUse the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\n\nMotivation\n\nMany security-conscious organizations using, or planning to use, Jenkins run off-the-shelf security scanners to look for known vulnerabilities.\nThese commonly flag the obsolete Guava library as susceptible to a serialization-related vulnerability ( CVE-2018-10237) and recommend upgrading.\nWhile Jenkins uses JEP-200 to form an explicit list of allowed classes for deserialization,\nand the two Guava classes affected by CVE-2018-10237 are not and will never be added to the list,\nit is time-consuming for the security team to respond to purported security reports\nand for users to justify exemptions from policy to use Jenkins anyway.\n\nFurthermore, the decade-old version of Guava has long been a maintenance burden for Jenkins developers.\nIn a world where Dependabot offers upgrades to libraries released just hours before,\nit is unpleasant to be working with dependencies that are many years old.\n\nFor more information, see JEP-233.\n\nUpgrading\n\nThe vast majority of plugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nJenkins users need only upgrade plugins to compatible versions as documented in the \"Released As\" field in Jira.\nIt is critical to use the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\nFailure to upgrade plugins to compatible versions may result in ClassNotFoundException, NoClassDefFoundError, or other low-level Java errors.\n\nReporting issues\n\nIf you find a regression in a plugin, please file a bug report in Jira:\n\nOpen JEP-233 issues\n\nWhen reporting an issue, include the following information:\n\nUse the JEP-233 label.\n\nProvide the complete list of installed plugins as suggested in the bug reporting guidelines.\n\nProvide the complete stack trace, if relevant.\n\nProvide steps to reproduce the issue from scratch on a minimal Jenkins installation; the scenario should fail when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.320 or later and pass when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.319 or earlier.\n\nIf you maintain a Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nthen please check if there is a pull request awaiting merge or release.\nIf you use an unmaintained Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nconsider stepping up and adopting the plugin to release a compatible version.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe expect to see a bit of disruption from these changes\nbut hope that in the long run they will save time for core and plugin developers\nand lead to a more secure and stable tool.\nPlease reach out on the developers' list with any questions or suggestions.","title":"Guava library upgrade (breaking

are many ways to set up your Jenkins environment, and depending on the configuration you choose, there are different best practices and options to optimize your environment.\nIn this blog, I‚Äôm going to focus on Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees as a way to fine-tune your environment.\nIt‚Äôs a free tool that can help administrators understand and manage their Jenkins controller.\nIf you‚Äôre a CloudBees customer, the tool automatically comes with CloudBees CI.\nHowever, it‚Äôs also available as a free open source tool to anyone who uses Jenkins.\nThe Jenkins Health Advisor tool can make your life easier, because it can arm you with the information you need to keep your Jenkins environment running smoothly.\n\nA Bit of Background\n\nThe CloudBees support team originally created the tool as a way to help customers troubleshoot Jenkins issues.\nWith the tool, our support engineers could gather information from a customer‚Äôs Jenkins controller about the configuration of the controller and agents, the operating system, stats from web requests, and the like.\nOur tech support teams used this data to help customers pinpoint problems, such as security vulnerabilities, performance problems, and plugin version issues.\nVery quickly, our support tooling team saw the bigger-picture benefits of the diagnostic tool as an opportunity for people to proactively manage their controller.\nWith that bit of background, let‚Äôs dive into the Jenkins Health Advisor tool so you understand how it can help you.\n\nThe Problem ‚Äî Lack of Visibility into Controller Environment\n\nBecause of the open-source nature of Jenkins and the vast array of plugins that you can deploy in your Jenkins installation, downstream code changes to plugins and corresponding dependencies can inadvertently impact your environment, which slows productivity, causes confusion, and impacts the quality of your software delivery.\nWhen problems arise, Jenkins administrators need to quickly pinpoint the root cause of an issue, and that can be quite a challenge.\n\nThe Solution ‚Äî Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees\n\nWhen an issue arises, you need razor sharp insight to help you quickly sift through lines upon lines of data about your Jenkins controller and your plugins to identify the problem.\nAnd, that‚Äôs exactly what Jenkins Health Advisor does.\nIt gives you specific information about potential problems in your environment so you can resolve issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen you first install the Jenkins Health Advisor tool in your environment, you‚Äôll receive a report that lists everything it detects in your system.\nYou‚Äôll then receive report emails only when something changes that could impact your environment or when the tool identifies an issue that could be problematic.\nIf there are no issues in your environment, you don‚Äôt receive an email.\nIt‚Äôs really that simple.\n\nThe Power is in the Insight ‚Ä¶ and the CloudBees Support\n\nOk, so let‚Äôs explain how Jenkins Health Advisor uses data to help you optimize your environment.\nThe tool actually generates a support bundle every 24 hours.\nWe don‚Äôt want to bog down your email inbox with redundant reports emails, so we don‚Äôt send every report to you‚Äîonly the reports that indicate an issue with your environment.\nHowever, CloudBees receives every support bundle from every user.\nWe are constantly monitoring all of this active Jenkins controller data with external Jenkins and open source data about known issues, plugin updates, security vulnerabilities, etc.\nIf the Jenkins Health Advisor tool identifies an issue that could impact your system, you‚Äôll receive an email so you can proactively address the problem.\nAt the same time, CloudBees engineering teams are continually working to enhance the detection capabilities of the Jenkins Health Advisor tool, so you can work as proactively as possible to manage your environment.\n\nThe emails you receive identify potential problems, and they also include supporting information to help you resolve issues, with links to solutions and recommended resolutions as well as articles to understand the problem.\n\nHelpful Tips to Gain Value from Jenkins Health Advisor\n\nImprove Troubleshooting\n\nIf you need to troubleshoot a particular issue, you can manually generate a support bundle to give you point-in-time information on your environment.\nYou can filter the support bundle data on different system parameters, like the build queue, dump agent export tables, and garbage collection logs, so you get the specific information you need.\n\nGenerate Anonymized System Data\n\nAt any time, you can change the settings on your tool to anonymize the data in your support bundles.\nYou may want to do this if you don‚Äôt want to share sensitive project data with CloudBees.\nOur support and engineering teams can still gain valuable insight from your generic system data.\nThis is also a helpful feature if you need to share system data with a partner or vendor, and you don‚Äôt want to share project or personnel data.\n\nJenkins Health Advisor Tool Updates and Support\n\nAs we mentioned above, the CloudBees support tooling team is constantly working to enhance the tool.\nTo ensure it‚Äôs always as current as possible, we release updates to the tool every two weeks.\nUsually these updates won‚Äôt impact your Jenkins environment.\nHowever, if there are changes to the tool that might affect your system, you‚Äôll receive a notification email so there are no surprises.\nAnd, if you need help with the Jenkins Health Advisor tool, our support engineers are available to answer your questions.\n\nStart Using Jenkins Health Advisor Today\n\nGiven the vast Jenkins community, it‚Äôs impossible to know everything that may impact your environment, even if you look at your control panel every day and scour open source forums on a regular basis to stay on top of new issues and vulnerabilities.\nThe Jenkins Health Advisor tool is designed to streamline the work effort of your daily routine by automatically telling you when there‚Äôs an issue that may impact your Jenkins environment.\nWith the proactive Jenkins Health Advisor notifications, you can spend your time on more strategic tasks.\n\nInstall the plugin and enroll your controller with

is a CI/CD solution and as such, it is critical that the open source plugins that constitute an integral part of it don‚Äôt expose the systems they are used on to any security risks and vulnerabilities.\nIt is in that context that we worked as an audit/code review team to track and report such flaws and problematic practices.\n\nWe worked in collaboration with Jenkins Security team member Wadeck Follonier, as part of an end-of-study project during our last year of the Master‚Äôs Degree - Reliability and IT Security in the university of Aix-Marseille.\n\nProject Goals\n\nThe main goal of this project was to allow us to discover and work on diverse security vulnerabilities in the context of a widely-used software solution, and in order to achieve that we had to separate the project in multiple other goals:\n\nLearning about some of the most common vulnerabilities and the form in which they can be found on a Jenkins Instance and its plugins.\n\nPerforming code review and technical audit on the application, and compiling our results as part of a security team.\n\nReporting our findings to the Jenkins team and the plugin maintainers, while sometimes helping the latter to correct these vulnerabilities.\n\nKnowledge Sharing\n\nAt the beginning of the project, we set up communication channels with our mentor through Slack and Google Meets, and agreed to schedule weekly sessions with him.\nThe goal of these sessions was both to teach us more about the functionalities of Jenkins and the types of vulnerabilities we would encounter, and to allow us to ask more specific questions regarding our findings.\n\nThanks to our mentor developing a mock plugin compiling a variety of classic vulnerabilities and several of their implementations, including server side request forgery ( SSRF), cross site scripting ( XSS), and XML external entity ( XXE) attacks, we have been able to learn through practice.\nIt allowed us to analyze the context of the code and the different ways the Jelly framework can be used to display information, expanding our payload options and giving us a clearer view of the patterns to look for during our code reviews.\n\nWe have also had the opportunity to learn about the process used to report the vulnerabilities to the maintainers through Jira issues, and some ways we could correct them or provide steps to do so.\n\nSearching and compiling\n\nAt first, we decided to work as a pretty loose team, with each member working on a different plugin and regrouping our findings to confirm or reject them, while staying in constant contact to ask each other questions.\nThis allowed us to broaden the scope of our searches, and is the reason why we have been able to find a larger number of vulnerabilities, in plugins that differed widely in popularity, than we would have working together from the start.\n\nWe used a single file to compile the plugins we audited and our findings, making it easier for our mentor to review them and give us feedback.\nPinpointing the specific portion of code causing the issue and providing reproduction steps as clear as we could proved useful for the reporting process, thus making the approval and correction faster.\n\nDuring the last third of this project, we began to work together on bigger plugins, in order to have more points of view reflecting on the same problem.\nWith different analyses, we were able to come up with new payloads, and sometimes with new vulnerabilities where we only found one separately.\n\nReporting and correcting the vulnerabilities\n\nAll of the reporting was done through Jira issues, which allows the Jenkins team to centralize and triage the vulnerabilities.\nOnce we provided the necessary information, along with the reproduction steps we had, a member of the Jenkins security team contacted the plugin maintainer and guided them through the next steps of the process, with hope that they would answer.\n\nWe have also tried to make the maintainers' job easier, working on some fixes.\nTo achieve this, we delved not only into the functionalities of the vulnerable plugins, but also into some mitigation processes that we found either in the Jenkins documentation,  or with the help of our mentor.\n\nEach one of our modifications has been tested locally, in order to assess whether the vulnerability was still present, and whether no function had been altered.\nHowever, some of the plugins we audited demanded more complex fixes, due to their intrinsic logic, or the thought process of their developer, which led to us being unable to provide a clear fix.\n\nConsidering this, the fixes we have been able to bring into light were only suggestions to the maintainers, for them to use as inspiration or template, in order not to interfere with the plugin logic.\n\nConclusion\n\nThrough this project, we have been able to work as a team, delving into some of the different issues that security engineers are bound to face, and the ways they have at their disposal to mitigate them.\nThis has allowed us to complement our studies with a more practical aspect, that we couldn‚Äôt have had otherwise, and to transition into the companies we are now interns in.\nThis experience has strongly encouraged us to improve in and document ourselves on this branch of cybersecurity, which will have a significant impact on our professional future.\n\nUseful links\n\nJenkins - 2021/03/30 Security Advisory - 5 from us\n\nJenkins - 2021/05/11 Security Advisory - 4 from us\n\nJenkins - 2021/05/25 Security Advisory - 3 from us\n\nJenkins - 2021/06/16 Security Advisory - 1 from us\n\nJenkins - 2021/06/18 Security Advisory - 1 from us\n\nMessage from the mentor\n\nI didn‚Äôt expect to have four students with a so deep desire to learn new things, new tricks.\nTheir curiosity helped them to find numerous vulnerabilities that already led to 14 published CVEs.\nThe experience was great and I wish them all the best for their professional career and their never ending quest for knowledge.\n\nIf you are student, intern, or just someone really interested in security and Jenkins in particularly, please reach out to us to see if there is a possibility to organize something together.\nMailing list: jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com","title":"Four students and their master project in Jenkins

Jenkins core upgrade.\nSee JEP-231 for the full list of the affected plugins.\nBelow there is the list of plugins that did not have their fix released at the time of writing.\nThey will start to break with the weekly on the 7th of June, expected to be the 2.297.\n\nteamconcert\n\nvs-code-metrics\n\nBlameSubversion\n\njavatest-report\n\nvss\n\nsynergy\n\nconfig-rotator\n\nharvest\n\ncmvc\n\nIn addition to these still-served plugins, a few others will break.\nNote however that these were already suspended [ 1 ] for various reasons, so we do recommend to move away from using them or step up as maintainers.\nThe IDs for these plugins are: tfs, svn-release-mgr, cpptest, cflint, script-scm, rtc.\n\nIt is always a good idea to update all your plugins before upgrading Jenkins core.\n\nPlease reach out on the developers‚Äô list with any questions or suggestions.\n\nGetting fixes in the affected plugins\n\nFor all affected plugins we have submitted pull requests with compatibility patches.\nThese plugins seem to have no active maintainer, and hence we cannot commit on delivering those fixes.\nIn mean time you can build a custom patch locally to resolve the issue on your instances.\nIf you use any of those plugins, consider stepping up and adopting them so that the fixes could be released.\nWe will appreciate any contributions!\n\nResources\n\nPR-5320\n\nremoving commons-digester:2.1.\nThis also contains a complete list of impacted plugins and their PRs and statuses.\n\nJEP-231\n\ndescribing this change.\n\n1. this means these plugins are not served anymore by the Jenkins Project‚Äôs hosting service. Even if they were released, the releases would not show up until additional issues are fixed.","title":"Apache Commons Digester library removal (breaking changes!)","tags":["jenkins","core","developer","announcement"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8e8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/ede19/batmat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/bc20c/batmat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/b691b/batmat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/8ba60/batmat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/a9ea7/batmat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/51559/batmat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/28f98/batmat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":130}}},"blog":"http://batmat.net","github":"batmat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Baptiste has been using and contributing to Jenkins since it was called differently, and is a huge proponent of the Agile, Devops &amp; Continuous Delivery movements.\nHe loves to discuss not only the technical aspects, but also the even more essential cultural aspects of this all, working together to improve the value provided to customers in a great inclusive and blameless environment.</p>\n</div>","id":"batmat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Baptiste Mathus","slug":"/blog/authors/batmat","twitter":"bmathus"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","id":"394ad183-1f00-5602-b583-2b72ef1215dc","slug":"/blog/2021/04/23/jenkins-contributor-awards/","strippedHtml":"This year, the Jenkins Contributor Awards will be run by the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) along with many other CDF Community Awards.\n\nThe nominations are currently open and are being accepted using GitHub issues to make the process more transparent.

April of last year, we launched a new Jenkins community website called JenkinsIsTheWay.\nThe Jenkins Is The Way site has collected the experiences of Jenkins users around the world as they develop software and create solutions.\nThey are charting new paths, discovering new opportunities, and overcoming challenges.\n\nThat‚Äôs what makes Jenkins Is The Way tick.\nEngineers in the Netherlands might have already met challenges faced by developers in India.\nSolutions uncovered by DevOps teams in Spain may benefit those just starting in the USA.\nInterns in Bogota may develop pipeline solutions that can be integrated into workflows used across the globe in Tokyo.\nOr vice versa!\n\nNo matter where you are, regardless of whether your solution is regional or global in nature, Jenkins Is The Way.\n\nTelling your stories in a new eBook\n\nTo date, we have nearly 60 user stories, a handful of case studies, and some new user testimonial videos from the Jenkins community.\nYou shared how using Jenkins has helped make your builds faster, your pipelines more secure, and your developers and software engineers happier.\nIn essence, Jenkins Is The Way showcases how Jenkins has made it a whole lot easier to do the work you do every day.\n\nWe‚Äôve now gathered some of those stories in our first Jenkins Is The Way ebook, covering various challenges and solutions from six different industries: Aerospace, Education, Finance, Insurance, Retail, and Travel.\n\nYou‚Äôll read about innovations from KP Labs in Poland and Preply in Ukraine.\nYou‚Äôll discover how automation helped Avoris out of Spain & Portugal and Tymit in the United Kingdom.\nAnd you‚Äôll be inspired by what China‚Äôs JD.com and Topdanmark in Denmark were able to achieve after tapping into the Jenkins community.\n\nThis curated collection of stories illustrates how Jenkins community members build next-generation DevOps and CI/CD platforms as the backbone for software innovation across companies of all sizes.\nThey highlight the innovation, ingenuity, and keen ability to adapt Jenkins plugins to handle everyday business issues, everywhere.\n\nThe technology landscape is full of solutions perfected to tackle all aspects of software development.\nBut time and time again, developers keep coming back to Jenkins.\nYour engineering time and resources are too valuable to be spent re-inventing the wheel or handling manual testing and deployment cycles.\n\nJenkins' vast array of plugins and pre-built solutions will have you automating more than you ever imagined.\nSo, get inspired to build great stuff with Jenkins.\nAnd, please share this ebook with your network.\n\nShare your story!\n\nAnd when you‚Äôre ready to tell your story, we‚Äôre prepared to help you share it.\nFill out the short questionnaire, and we‚Äôll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt as a thank you!\n\nSpecial thanks to CloudBees, Inc. for sponsoring this program.","title":"New eBook: Build,

the mentor summit and the project retrospectives finished in October,\nnow we can call Google Summer of Code 2020 officially over in the Jenkins community.\nOn behalf of the Jenkins org team, we would like to thank all participants: students, mentors, applicants, and dozens of other contributors who participated in the project this year.\nGoogle Summer of Code would not be successful without the active participation of the Jenkins community.\n\nIf you follow the Jenkins blog, you may have already seen many GSoC 2020 articles created by the project teams.\nHere I would like to focus on the key highlights from the project.\n\nProjects\n\nIn 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.\nWe had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.\nAs usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.\nThe projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes\nneeded for long-term evolution of Jenkins.\n\nHere are the projects we had this year:\n\nCustom Jenkins distribution build service by Sladyn Nunes\n\nExternal Fingerprint Storage by Sumit Sarin\n\nGit Plugin Performance Improvements by Rishabh Budhouliya\n\nGitHub Checks API for Jenkins Plugins by Kezhi Xiong\n\nJenkins X: Apps/Addons consolidation by Zixuan Liu\n\nMachine Learning Plugins for Data Science by Loghi Perinpanayagam\n\nJenkins Windows Services: YAML Configuration Support by Buddhika Chathuranga\n\nPlease refer to the project pages for more information, links to the blog posts, and project demos.\nLet‚Äôs focus on the results instead.\nThis is the first ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.\nIt was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!\n\n.\n\nThanks a lot to all mentors who were guiding students during their projects:\nZhao Xiaojie,\nKristin Whetstone,\nParichay Barpanda,\nMartin d‚ÄôAnjou,\nOleg Nenashev,\nAndrey Falko,\nMike Cirioli,\nMark Waite,\nFrancisco Fernandez,\nJustin Harringa,\nOmkar Deshpande,\nUlli Hafner,\nTim Jacomb,\nKara de la Marck,\nJames Strachan,\nNeha Gupta,\nOscar Medina,\nNikhil Da Rocha,\nSahil Kalra,\nBruno P. Kinoshita,\nIoannis Moutsatsos,\nMarky Jackson,\nShivay Lamba, and\nNext Turn.\n\nGSoC 2020 Org admin team:\nKara de la Marck,\nMartin d‚ÄôAnjou,\nMarky Jackson,\nOleg Nenashev.\n\nEvents\n\nThanks to the GSoC organization stipend from Google and other donations,\nthe Jenkins project usually provides travel grants to successful students so that they can visit a major community event, meet their mentors and community members in person, and present their work there.\nHere are some notes about the GSoC 2019 travel.\nUnfortunately this year it was not possible, and GSoC went completely virtual this year.\n\nOnline meetups\n\nIn August we organized Jenkins Online Meetups where students have presented their projects\n( part 1, part 2).\nYou can find recordings of these presentations in this playlist on the Jenkins YouTube channel.\n\nDevOps World\n\nThis year CloudBees, one of the Jenkins corporate sponsors, invited all students to participate in the DevOps World virtual conference on September 23-25.\nGSoC students did lighting talks about their projects, attended other conference talks, and joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation booth which represented the project at the conference.\nYou can find recordings of the talks and all materials here.\nAlthough the conference was in September, the talks were pre-recorded in early August.\nPlease refer to the Jenkins online meetup recordings for the recent versions.\n\nGSoC Mentor summit\n\nThis is a regular gathering for Google Summer of Code mentors and org admins where they share their experiences about GSoC, outreach programs, community management, and tools.\nUsually it is organized as a multi-day unconference after the end of GSoC, with 2-3 representatives from each project.\nIt has been a great learning experience to participate in it.\nThis year it was a single-day virtual event, and all mentors were able to attend.\nShivay Lamba, one of the GSoC 2020 mentors, also did a lightning talk about the GSoC projects he was working on in Jenkins and CNCF ( slides).\n\nSwag\n\nAll Google Summer of Code students and mentors get swag from Google.\nThis year, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) has sponsored swag for 50 most active GSoC participants:\nall students, mentors, and many other contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.\nThis is the third year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag,\nIn the previous years the swag logistics was one of the most challenging tasks for org admins during the entire project.\nand we highly appreciate help from CDF with this part.\nAs DevOps World presenters, the students have also received special edition speaker swag from CloudBees.\n\nThanks a lot to Google, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) and CloudBees!\n\nRetrospective\n\nAfter completion of the coding phases,\norg admins have reached out to all GSoC 2020 participants to gather their feedback and suggestions.\nWe also recommended that project teams hold their own retrospective meetings.\nSuch information is instrumental to continuously improving GSoC in the Jenkins community.\nWe thank all contributors who shared their feedback!\n\nThe organization-wide retrospective was organized as a survey and a series of retrospective meetings.\nYou can find aggregated results in this Google Doc.\nOverall, we received very positive feedback from students and mentors.\nThe GSoC framework in Jenkins has matured significantly during the previous years.\nThe effort we invested to create guidelines and recommendations for all parties helped a lot because all the expectations were known in advance.\nAs usual, there is much to improve, especially with regards to the community bonding phases and cross-project communications.\nWe are processing the feedback, and we will expand our documentation and the contributor onboarding plans next year.\n\nSome personal notes\n\nI have been involved in leading and coordinating Google Summer of Code in open source projects since 2016.\nThis year I visited the GSoC stand at FOSDEM and met a few organizers and former students.\nA few days after, I proposed participating in GSoC at the Jenkins contributor summit in Brussels,\nand several contributors supported this idea.\nWe spent several hours to create the first Jenkins GSoC page and brainstorm on project ideas.\nWe submitted our application and were accepted.\nThanks a lot to the Google team that gave us a chance!\n\nIt is great to work with the students and see how they explore the open source community and grow professionally as engineers.\nIt is also awesome to see how some of them stay in the project and keep contributing,\nincluding becoming plugin maintainers and GSoC mentors.\nBut, for me, Google Summer of Code is not just about mentoring.\nIt also helps a lot with the community bonding‚Ä¶‚Äã for the existing community like Jenkins which has a lot of isolated sub-communities in plugins.\nMany maintainers work alone, and it can be quite lonely working to maintain a plugin without feedback, developer ideas, and user interactions.\nWhen plugin contributors become project mentors, they join the wider community effort and work in teams.\nIn many cases they start contributing to the organization-wide activities and goals,\nand it grows the \"backbone\" of the Jenkins community.\nLike other community-driven projects, we need such backbone to scale the community and onboard more contributors to the countless Jenkins components.\nSo far it works really well and GSoC excels among outreach programs in this regard.\n\nI would like to thank the Google Open Source team, students and all Jenkins community members for the great Google Summer of Code this year.\nWe also thank the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help to recognize contributors and allow organization administrators to focus on projects.\nLast but not least, I would like to thank the Jenkins org admin team:\nMartin d‚ÄôAnjou,\nMarky Jackson, and\nKara de la Marck.\nThis was a crazy year for everyone. Regardless of that, the org admins stepped up and took responsibility for students and mentors involved in the project, with a serious time commitment.\nNot all work by the organizers is publicly visible (applications, project selection, resolving conflicts),\nbut this work is essential to the project‚Äôs success.\nThanks a lot to org admins and mentors who helped with the administrative tasks this year!\n\nWhat‚Äôs about GSoC 2021?\n\nYes, we plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021.\nThe application period for organizations will start in a few months,\nbut we have already started preparing for the next GSoC session.\nWe are looking for mentors, org admins and project ideas.\nPlease contact us if you are interested!\n\nCall for Mentors and Project Ideas\n\nGSoC 2021 project ideas\n\nHOWTO: Propose a project idea\n\nInformation for mentors : guidelines and expectations\n\nWe invite potential students to start exploring the project and the available project ideas.\nOriginal ideas are always welcome in the project, and starting early is a great opportunity to\nget introduced to the Jenkins community, collect more information about the problem areas,\nand to create a good proposal.\n\"Start early\" is the most popular recommendation from GSoC 2020 participants to future GSoC students,\nand we encourage you to follow this advice!","title":"Google Summer of Code 2020 summary","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2020","jenkins","community","events","mentor"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"jenkins","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":5,"currentPage":1}},
