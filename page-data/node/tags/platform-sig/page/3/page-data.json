This is the vast majority of Windows systems these days,\nso this will help more users install Jenkins using the installer package.\n\nThe user is now able to enter user information for the service and select the port that Jenkins will use and verify that the port is available.\n\nThe installer no longer bundles a JRE, but will search for a compatible JRE on the system. If the user wants to use a different JRE, they can specify during install.\n\nThe installer has support for running with a Java 11 JRE, including the components listed on the Java 11 Preview Page.\n\nthe JENKINS_HOME directory is placed in the LocalAppData directory for the user that the service will run as, this aligns with modern Windows file system layouts.\n\nThe installer has been updated with branding to make it look nicer and provide a better user experience.\n\nScreenshots\n\nBelow are screenshots of the new installer sequence:\n\nStep 1\n\nThe Jenkins logo is now a prominent part of the UI for the installer.\n\nStep 2\n\nThe Jenkins logo and name are now in the header during all phases of the installer.\n\nStep 3\n\nThe installer now allows you to specify the username/password for the account to run as and checks that the account has LogonAsService rights.\n\nStep 4\n\nThe installer also allows you to specify the port that Jenkins should run on and will not continue until a valid port is entered and tested.\n\nStep 5\n\nInstead of bundling a JRE, the installer now searches for a compatible JRE on the system (JRE 8 is the current search). If you want to use a different\nJRE on the system than the one found by the installer, you can browse and specify it. Only JRE 8 and JRE 11 runtimes are supported. The installer will\nautomatically add the necessary arguments and additional jar files for running under Java 11 if the selected JRE is found to be version 11.\n\nStep 6\n\nAll of the items that users can enter in the installer should be overridable on the command line for automated deployment as well. The full list of properties that\ncan be overridden will be available soon.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe new installer is under review by the members of the Platform SIG, but we need people to test the installer and give feedback. If you are interested in testing\nthe new installer, please join the Platform SIG gitter room for more information.\n\nThere are still some things that are being researched and implemented in the new installer (e.g., keeping port and other selections when doing an upgrade), but it is\ngetting close to release.\n\nIn addition to updates to the MSI based Windows installer, the Platform SIG is working on taking over the Chocolatey Jenkins package and\nreleasing a version for each update.","title":"Windows Installer

refer to Running Jenkins on Java 11 documentation to have the up-to-date details on how to run Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nThis is a joint blogpost prepared by the Java 11 Support Team.\nOn Dec 18 (4PM UTC) we will be also presenting the Java 11 Preview Support at the Jenkins Online Meetup\n( link)\n\nJenkins, one of the leading open-source automation servers, still supports only Java 8.\nOn September 25 OpenJDK 11 was released.\nThis is a Long-Term-Support which will stay around for years,\nand in the Jenkins project we are interested to offer a full support of this version.\nOver the last year many contributors have been working towards enabling support for Java 11 in the project (Jenkins JEP-211).\nIt was a thorny path,\nbut now, on behalf of the Jenkins Platform SIG,\nwe are happy to announce preview availability of Java 11 support in Jenkins weekly releases!\n\nWhy do we need preview availability for Java 11?\nIt offers Jenkins contributors and early adopters a way\nto try out the changes before the general availability release happens early next year.\nIt should help us to get more exploratory testing and, hopefully,\nresolve most of the issues before Java 11 is officially supported in Jenkins.\n\nIn this blog post we will describe how to run with Java 11,\nand how to investigate compatibility issues and report them.\n\nBackground\n\nAs you probably remember,\nin June 2018 we had an online hackathon targeting Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nAs a part of the hackathon,\nwe provided the experimental support of Java 11.\nThis event was a big success for us,\nand we were able to get Jenkins running with Java 10 and 11-ea,\nincluding major features like Jenkins Pipeline, JobDSL, Docker/Kubernetes plugins, Configuration as Code, BlueOcean, etc.\nIt gave us confidence that we can provide Java 11 support in Jenkins without major breaking changes.\nAfter the hackathon, Oleg Nenashev created\njep:211[\"Java 10+ support in Jenkins\"] (was later adjusted to target Java 11 only).\nPlatform Special Interest Group\nhas been also founded to coordinate the Java 11 support work\nand other platform support efforts (packaging, operating system support, etc.).\n\nA group of contributors continued working on Java 11 support,\nmostly focusing on upstreaming functional patches,\nenabling Java 11 support in development tools,\ntesting and addressing known compatibility issues.\nSee the Platform SIG meeting notes for detailed status updates.\nStarting from Jenkins 2.148, Jenkins successfully runs with latest OpenJDK 11 releases on various Linux and Windows platforms.\nWe performed a LOT of automated and exploratory tests, Jenkins plugins appear to work well with some exceptions (see below).\nThere is ongoing test automation effort towards the GA releases,\nbut we were able to successfully run Jenkins core tests,\nfull Acceptance Test Harness,\nand Plugin Compat Tester for recommended plugins.\nWe also deployed a temporary\nExperimental Update Center for Java 11\nwhich allows quickly delivering fixes for Java 11 early adopters.\nJenkins 2.155+ defaults to this update center when running with Java 11,\nand that’s why we announce preview availability for this version.\n\nOn Nov 19, 2018 we presented the current Java 11 support status at the Platform SIG meeting\nslides,\nand we agreed that we would like to proceed with the preview availability so that\nwe can offer something for evaluation to Jenkins users.\nBy the next meeting on Dec 04, all blockers have been addressed,\nand the Platform SIG meeting signed off the Java 11 preview availability.\n\nRunning Jenkins and Java 11 in Docker\n\nStarting from Jenkins 2.155, we provide Docker images for the Jenkins controller and agent.\nAll these images are based on the official\nopenjdk:11-jdk image maintained by the Docker Community.\nThere were discussions about migrating to other base images,\nbut we decided to exclude it from the Preview Availability scope.\nSimilarly, we do not provide Alpine images for now.\n\nJenkins controller image\n\nJava 11 support is now provided as a part of the official\njenkins/jenkins image.\nYou can run the Jenkins with Java 11 simply as:\n\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:jdk11\n\nThe following tags are available:\n\njdk11 - Latest weekly release with Java 11 support\n\n2.155-jdk11 - Weekly releases packaged with Java 11\n\nThe image is fully compatible with\njenkins/jenkins documentation,\ne.g. you can use plugins.txt to install plugins, mount volumes and pass extra options via environment variables.\n\nAgent images\n\nIf you use containerized agents via Docker or Kubernetes plugins,\nwe have also released official Docker images for Jenkins agents:\n\njenkins/agent\n\njenkins/inbound-agent\n\njenkins/ssh-build-agent\n\nAll images use the latest-jdk11 image tag for JDK11 bundles.\nAnd sorry for the obsolete names!\n\nExperimental Jenkins controller images\n\nIn order to simplify testing, we also provide some experimental images on DockerHub.\nWe set up a continuous delivery flow for them,\nso you can get patches without waiting for Jenkins weekly releases.\n\njenkins4eval/blueocean-platform-support -\nEquivalent of jenkinsci/blueocean\n\nTag: latest-jdk11\n\nThe image bundles all Jenkins Pipeline and Blue Ocean patches required to run on Java 11\n\nIf you want to try Pipeline, use this image\n\njenkins/jenkins-experimental -\nEquivalent of jenkins/jenkins\n\nTag: latest-jdk11\n\nThe image is released from the java11-support feature branch in the Jenkins core\n\nThe branch may be slightly ahead or behind the master branch,\nwe may use the branch to quickly deliver patches to Java 11 users\n\nEventually we will move the experimental flow to the new jenkins4eval organization\nbeing created as a part of jep:217[].\n\nRunning jenkins.war with Java 11\n\nRunning without Docker is not that trivial,\nbecause Jenkins depends on some modules which have been removed from Java 11.\nWe plan to address it in the General Availability release somehow (see jira:JENKINS-52186[]),\nbut for now some manual actions are required to run Jenkins WAR with Java 11.\n\nDownload Jenkins WAR for 2.155\n\nDownload the following libraries to the same directory as jenkins.war\n\njaxb-api-2.3.0.jar (save as jaxb-api.jar)\n\njaxb-core-2.3.0.1.jar (save as jaxb-core.jar)\n\njaxb-impl-2.3.0.1.jar (save as jaxb-impl.jar)\n\njavax.activation v.1.2.0 (save as javax.activation.jar)\n\nRun the following command:\n\nRun Jenkins with ${JAVA11_HOME}/bin/java \\\n    -p jaxb-api.jar:javax.activation.jar --add-modules java.xml.bind,java.activation \\\n    -cp jaxb-core.jar:jaxb-impl.jar \\\n    -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java --httpPort=8080 --prefix=/jenkins\n\nKnown compatibility issues\n\nTo help users to track down the compatibility issues,\nwe have created a new Known Java 11 Compatibility Issues Wiki page.\n\nSeveral important issues and obstacles:\n\nPipeline: Support Plugin has a known issue\nwith context persistency when running with Java 11 (jira:JENKINS-51998[])\n\nWe have deployed a temporary fix to the\nExperimental Update Center for Java 11.\n Fix version: 3.0-java11-alpha-1\n\nIf you use Jenkins Pipeline, make sure you run with this fix.\nOtherwise the jobs will fail almost immediately\n\nWhen updating instances to Java 11, make sure there is no running Pipelines\n\njira:JENKINS-54305[] -\nJDK Tool Plugin does not offer installers for JDK 11\n\njira:JENKINS-52282[] -\nJava Web Start is no longer available in Java 11, so it is no longer possible to start agents from Web UI.\nWe do not plan to provide a replacement.\n\nWe also know about some minor incompatibilities in other plugins,\nbut we do not consider them as blockers for preview availability.\n\nReporting compatibility issues\n\nIf you discover any Java 11 incompatibilities, please\nreport issues in our bugtracker.\nPlease set java11-compatibility labels for such issues\nso that they automatically appear on the Wiki page and get triaged.\n\nFor the security issues please use the standard\nvulnerability reporting process.\nAlthough we will be fixing Java 11 specific issues in public while it is in the preview,\nfollowing the security process will help us to investigate impact on Java 8 users.\n\nJava 11 Support Team\n\nOnce Java 11 support is released, we expect reports of regressions in plugins and Jenkins core.\nOne of the concerns are exotic platforms with native libraries, and of course other Java versions.\nThere is also a risk of 3rd-party library incompatibilities with Java 11.\nTo mitigate the risks, we have created a\nJava 11 Support Team.\nThis team will be focusing on triaging the incoming issues,\nhelping to review pull requests and, in some cases, delivering the fixes.\nThe process for this team is documented in JEP-211.\n\nWe do not expect the Java 11 Support Team to be able to fix all discovered issues,\nand we will be working with Jenkins core and plugin maintainers to get the fixes delivered.\nIf you are interested to join the team,\nreach out to us in the Platform SIG Gitter Channel.\n\nContributing\n\nWe will appreciate any kind of contributions in the Java 11 effort,\nincluding trying out Jenkins with Java 11, reporting and fixing compatibility issues.\n\nIf you want to do the exploratory testing,\nwe recommend to try out Java 11 support at one of your test instances.\nSuch testing will be much appreciated,\nespecially if you use some service integration plugins or exotic platforms.\nThe issue reporting guidelines are provided above\n\nIf you are a plugin developer/maintainer,\nwe would appreciate if you could test your plugin with Java 11.\nIn order to help with that, we have created a Wiki page with\nJava 11 Developer guidelines.\nThis page explains how to build and test plugins with Java 11,\nand it also lists known issues in development tools\n\nWhatever you do, please let us know about your experience by sending a message to\nthe Platform SIG mailing list.\nSuch information will help us a lot to track changes and contributions.\nAny other feedback about the migration complexity will be appreciated!\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nOn Dec 18 (4PM UTC) we will be presenting the Java 11 Preview Support at the Jenkins Online Meetup\n( link).\nAt this meetup we will summarize the current Java 11 Preview support status.\nIf you are a plugin developer, we will also organize separate sessions about testing plugins with Java 11 and about common best practices for fixing compatibility issues.\nPlease follow the Platform SIG announcements if you are interested.\n\nIn the next weeks we will focus on addressing feedback from early adopters and\nfixing the discovered compatibility issues.\nWe will also continue working on Java 11 support patches towards the general availability next year (jira:JENKINS-51805[]).\nIn addition to that, we will start working on Java 11 support in subprojects,\nincluding Jenkins X and Jenkins Evergreen.\n\nLinks\n\nJEP-211: Java 11 support in Jenkins\n\nJava requirements in Jenkins\n\nKnown Java 11 Compatibility Issues\n\nJava 11 Developer guidelines\n\nPlatform Special Interest
