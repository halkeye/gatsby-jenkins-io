This blog post will summarize the work done till the midterm of the coding phases i.e. week 6. If some of the topics here require a more detailed explanation, I will write a separate blog post. These blogs posts will not have a very defined format but would cover all of the user stories or features implemented.\n\nProject Summary\n\nThe main idea behind the project is to build a customizable jenkins distribution service that could be used to build tailor-made jenkins distributions. The service would provide users with a simple interface to select the configurations they want to build the instance with eg: plugins, authorization matrices etc. Furthermore it would include a section for sharing community created distros so that users can find and download already built jenkins war/configuration files to use out of the box.\n\nQuick review\n\nPull Requests Opened\n38\n\nGithub Issues completed\n36\n\nDetails\n\nI have written separate blog posts for every week in GSoC and the intricate details for each of them can be found at their respective blog pages. I am including a summary for every phase supported with the respective links.\n\nCommunity Bonding\n\nThis year GSoC had a longer community bonding than any of the previous editions due to the Coronavirus pandemic and therefore this gave me a lot of time to explore, so I spent it by building a prototype for my project. I realised some of the blockages I might face early on, and therefore it gave me more clarity in terms of how I can proceed. I also spent this time preparing a design document which you can find here.\n\nCommunity Bonding Blog\n\nWeek 1\n\nIn week one, I spent time getting used to the tech stack I would be using, I was pretty familiar with Spring Boot but React was something I was going to be using for the first time, so I spent time studying more about it. I also got the project page ready, the issues I was going to tackle and the milestones that I had to achieve before the evaluation. I also spent a bit of time setting up the home page and a bit of front-end components.\n\nWeek 1 Blog\n\nWeek 2\n\nOnce we were done with the initial setup, it was time to work on the core of the project.\nIn the second week, I worked on generating the package configuration and the plugin list dummy display page setup.\nI also ran into issues with the Jenkinsfile so the majority of time was spent fixing it.\nFinally I managed to get around those problems.\nYou can read more about it in the Week 2 Blog post.\n\nWeek 2 Blog\n\nWeek 3\n\nThe last week was spent cleaning up most of the code and getting the remaining milestones in. This was probably the hardest part of phase 1 because it involved connecting the front and back end of the project.You can read more about it here.\n\nWeek 3\n\nMidterm Update\n\nThe second phase has been going on for the past 3 weeks and we have already accomplished a majority of the deliverables including community configurations, war downloading and filtering of plugins. More details about the mid term report can be found here.\n\nMidterm Update\n\nGetting the Code\n\nThe Custom Distribution Service was created from scratch during GSoC and can be found here on Github.\n\nOther links\n\nGSoC Proposal\nDesign Document\nDaily Notes\nDemo\n\nFeedback channel\n\nGitter Channel Link.","title":"Custom Distribution Service : Midterm Summary","tags":["service","distribution","cloud-native","gsoc","gsoc2020","packaging","platform-sig"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"sladyn98","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sladyn is a Computer Science student at Mumbai University, India.\nHe is participating in Community Bridge 2019 to provide development tools to JCasC plugin in the form of IDE integrations, schema architecture improvements and configuration extension points <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin\">Configuration as Code Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"sladyn98","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sladyn Nunes","slug":"/blog/author/sladyn98","twitter":"SladynN"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"615c1ac2-c3da-5001-be28-908ac6008d94","slug":"/blog/2020/07/09/git-performance-improvement-phase1/","strippedHtml":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement is a Google Summer of Code 2020 project.\nIt aims to improve the performance of the git plugin, which provides fundamental git functionalities.\n\nInternally, the plugin provides these functionalities using two implementations: command line git and JGit (pure java implementation).\n\nCLI git is the default implementation for the plugin, a user can switch to JGit if needed\n\nThe project is divided into two parallel stages:\n\nStage 1 : Create benchmarks which evaluate the execution time of a git operation provided by CLI git and JGit using JMH, a micro benchmarking test harness.\n\nStage 2 : Implement the insights gained from the analysis into the plugin to improve the overall performance of the plugin.\n\nThe project also aims to fix any existing performance bottlenecks within the plugin as well.\n\nBenchmarks\n\nThe benchmarks are written using JMH. It was introduced in a GSoC 2019 project to Jenkins.\n\nJMH is provided within the plugin through the Jenkins Unit Test Harness POM dependency.\n\nThe JMH benchmarks are created and run within the git client plugin\n\nDuring phase-1, we have created benchmarks for two operations: \"git fetch\" and \"git ls-remote\"\n\nResults and Analysis\n\nThe benchmark analysis for git fetch:\n\nGit fetch results\n\nThe performance of git fetch (average execution time/op) is strongly correlated to the size of a repository\n\nThere exists an inflection point on the scale of repository size after which the nature of JGit performance changes (it starts to degrade)\n\nAfter running multiple benchmarks, it is safe to say that for a large sized repository CLI-git would be a better choice of implementation.\n\nWe can use this insight to implement a feature which avoids JGit when it comes to large repositories.\n\nPlease refer to PR-521 for an elaborate explanation on these results\n\nNote: Repository size means du -h .git\n\nFixing redundant fetch issue\n\nThe git plugin performs two fetch operations instead of one while performing a fresh checkout of a remote git repository.\n\nTo fix this issue, we had to safely remove the second fetch keeping multiple use-cases in mind. The fix itself was not difficult to code, but to do that safely without breaking any existing use-case was a challenging task.\n\nFurther Plan\n\nAfter consolidating a benchmarking strategy during Phase 1, the next steps will be:\n\nProvide functionality to the git plugin, which enables it to estimate the size of the repository without cloning it.\n\nBroaden the scope of benchmarking strategy\n\nConsider parameters like number of branches, references and commit history to find a relation with the performance of a git operation\n\nThe git plugin depends on other plugins like Credentials which might require benchmarking the plugin itself and the effects of these external dependencies on the plugin’s performance\n\nFocus on other use-cases of the plugin\n\nFor phase-1, I focused on the checkout step and the operations involved with it\n\nFor the next phase, the focus will shift to other areas like Multibranch pipelines or Organisation Folders\n\nHow can you help?\n\nIf you have reached this far of the blog, you might be interested in the project.\n\nTo help, you can\n\nReview the benchmarks in the benchmarks module\n\nAnalyse the benchmarks results available on ci.jenkins.io [soon]\n\nCome visit our Gitter channel: https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/git-plugin","title":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement: Phase-1","tags":["plugins","git","platform-sig","developer","performance","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#685848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/77b35/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/d4a57/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/68974/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/ef6ff/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/8257c/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/6766a/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/22bfc/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"rishabhBudhouliya","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2020 student under the Jenkins project (Git Plugin Performance Improvements).\nAspiring to be better at Software Development and participate more in the open source\ncommunity.</p>\n</div>","id":"rishabhbudhouliya","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rishabh Budhouliya","slug":"/blog/author/rishabhbudhouliya","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a9a89ae0-1c8f-5566-81ab-6fdf73b725f7","slug":"/blog/2020/05/11/docker-windows-agents/","strippedHtml":"We would like to announce the availability of official Windows agent images for Docker.\nThese images allow provisioning Jenkins agents with Windows OS on Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nNew images\n\nAll official Docker images for agents now provide nanoserver-1809 and windowsservercore-1809 tags which include Windows images and, at the moment, Java 8 (these are like the latest tag).\nWe also provide tags with explicit Java selection, e.g. jdk8-windowsservercore-1809 or jdk11-nanoserver-1809.\nVersion tags are also available, e.g. jenkins/agent:4.3-4-jdk8-nanoserver-1809.\n\njenkins/agent is a basic agent which bundles the agent.jar for agent ⇐ ⇒ controller communication. This is most useful as a base image for other images.\nWindows images are available starting from version 4.3-4\n\njenkins/inbound-agent is an agent that is based on the jenkins/agent image above. It provides a wrapper script written in PowerShell to help specify the parameters to agent.jar.\nWindows images are available starting from version 4.3-4\n\njenkins/ssh-agent is an image which has OpenSSH installed and should be used with the SSH Build Agents Plugin.\nWindows images are available starting from version 2.1.0\n\nUsing Windows Docker images\n\nTo use the new images, you will need a proper Docker or Kubernetes environment which supports running Windows containers.\nFor Windows desktop users, the easiest way is to use Docker for Windows.\nWindows support in Kubernetes is documented here.\n\njenkins/agent\n\nThe jenkins/agent image is a simple agent with the JDK and the agent.jar (Jenkins Remoting library).\n\nThere are two main use cases for this image:\n\nAs a base image for other Docker images (e.g., FROM jenkins/agent:jdk8-nanoserver-1809 in your Dockerfile). The jenkins/inbound-agent is based on this image.\n\nThis image may also be used to launch an agent using the Launch method of Launch agent via execution of command on the master.  This allows the controller to launch the agent inside the docker container automatically.\n\nTo run the agent for the second use case, you would specify the following command on the Jenkins controller after setting Remote root directory to C:\\Users\\jenkins\\agent :\n\ndocker run -i --rm --name agent --init jenkins/agent:jdk8-windowsservercore-1809 java -jar C:/ProgramData/Jenkins/agent.jar\n\njenkins/inbound-agent\n\nThe inbound-agent Docker image tries to provide a higher level interaction with the agent.jar executable. It provides a PowerShell wrapper script around agent.jar and it is specified as the entrypoint so that you just need to pass in some command line arguments to run the agent. A pull request has been opened which documents these command line parameters and environment variables.\n\nExample:\n\ndocker run jenkins/inbound-agent:windowsservercore-1809 `\n   -Url http://jenkins-server:port `\n   -WorkDir=C:/Users/jenkins/Agent `\n   -Secret `\n   -Name\n\nExample using environment variables:\n\ndocker run -e \"JENKINS_URL=http://jenkins-server:port\" -e \"JENKINS_AGENT_NAME=AGENTNAME\" `\n   jenkins/inbound-agent:windowsservercore-1809 `\n   -WorkDir=C:/Users/jenkins/Agent `\n   -Secret `\n   -Name\n\nThe -Url, -Name and -Secret parameters are required, but can be specified as either command line parameters or environment variables.\n\njenkins/ssh-agent\n\nAs mentioned above the jenkins/ssh-agent docker image is based on SSH communication with the controller, rather than the remoting TCP or WebSocket protocols. The image sets up a jenkins user and the OpenSSH server so that the controller can connect to the agent via SSH. The image expects an SSH public key as a parameter and puts that key into the authorized_keys file for the jenkins user. The private key should be specified in the agent configuration on the controller to allow the controller to connect.\n\nExample:\n\ndocker run jenkins/ssh-agent:jdk8-windowsservercore-1809 \"\"\n\nYou can also pass the public key as an environment variable when using docker run.\n\nExample:\n\ndocker run -e \"JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=\" jenkins/ssh-agent:jdk8-windowsservercore-1809\n\nYou will then be able to connect this agent using the SSH Build Agents Plugin as \"jenkins\" with the matching private key.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe are considering providing versions based on Windows Server 2019 build 1909 so that Jenkins users can run these images on GKE clusters (see this issue).\n\nWe are also looking into providing multiarch manifests which would allow Windows images to be part of the latest tag.\n\nThere is also an open pull-request to create a Windows based Docker image for a Jenkins controller. There hasn’t been a lot of requests for this, but to make the offerings complete for Windows users, the pull request was created.\n\nFor plans unrelated to Windows, please see the Docker images for agents: New names and What’s next blogpost.","title":"Windows Docker Agent Images: General Availability","tags":["announcement","docker","platform-sig","windows"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#988878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/19e71/slide_o_mix.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/77b35/slide_o_mix.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/d4a57/slide_o_mix.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/19e71/slide_o_mix.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/ef6ff/slide_o_mix.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/8257c/slide_o_mix.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/aad9316d8598468ffde48a1a515f07ed/6766a/slide_o_mix.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"slide","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Alex comes from a .NET background but likes to get his hands dirty in many different languages and frameworks.

would like to announce the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.\nIt does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.\nThis article provides information about the new official names, upgrade procedure, and the support policy for the old images.\nWe will also talk about what’s next for the Docker packaging in Jenkins.\n\nNew image names\n\njenkins/agent is the new name of the old jenkins/slave image,\nstarting from 4.3-2\n\njenkins/inbound-agent is the new name of the jenkins/jnlp-slave image,\nstarting from 4.3-2\n\njenkins/ssh-agent is the new name of the old jenkins/ssh-slave image,\nstarting from 2.0.0\n\nSee the upgrade guidelines below.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe \"slave\" term is widely considered inappropriate in open source communities.\nIt has been officially deprecated in Jenkins 2.0 in 2016, but there are remaining usages in some Jenkins components.\nThe jira:JENKINS-42816[Slave to Agent renaming leftovers] EPIC tracks cleanup of such usages.\nOfficial Docker agent images were a glaring case, it was not easy to fix that with the previous versions of the image release Pipelines on DockerHub.\nIt is great to have the image naming issue finally fixed by this update.\n\nAnother notable change is replacing the JNLP agent term with inbound agent.\nHistorically \"JNLP\" has been used as a name of Remoting protocols.\nJNLP stands for Java Network Launch Protocol which is a part of the Java Web Start.\nJenkins supports Java Web Start mode for agents when running agents on Java 1.8,\nbut our networking protocols are based on TCP and have nothing to do with Java Network Launch Protocol.\nThis name has been very confusing since the beginning\nand became worse with the introduction of WebSocket support in Jenkins 2.217 (jep:222[]).\nDocker agent images support WebSockets, so we decided to change the image name to jenkins/inbound-agent so that it prevents further confusion.\nInbound agent term refers to agent protocols in which the agent initiates the connection to the Jenkins controller through different protocols.\n\nThanks a lot to Alex Earl and krufab for the repository restructuring groundwork which made the renaming possible!\nAlso thanks to Tim Jacomb, Marky Jackson, Mark Waite, Ivan Fernandez Calvo and other contributors for their reviews and testing.\n\nUpgrading and Compatibility Notes\n\nGood news, there are no breaking changes caused by this renaming.\nAll images have been already modified to use the new terminology internally.\nIf you use the recent versions of the previous images,\nyou can just replace the old names with the new ones.\nThese names may be referenced in your Dockerfiles, scripts, and Jenkins configurations.\n\nWe will keep updating the old images on DockerHub for at least 3 months (until August 05, 2020).\nThere will be no new configurations and platforms added to the old images,\nbut all existing ones will remain available (Debian for Java 1.8 and 11, Alpine for Java 1.8, etc.).\nAfter August 05, 2020, the old images will no longer receive updates, but previous versions will remain available to users on DockerHub.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe will continue renaming of the Docker images in Jenkins components which reference old image names.\nThere is also a set of convenience Docker images which include build tools like Maven or Gradle which will be renamed later.\nThe jenkins/ssh-agent image might be renamed again in the future as well;\nsee the ongoing discussion in this developer mailing list thread.\n\nIf you are rather interested in new features in Jenkins Docker packaging,\nstay tuned for future announcements!\nThere are multiple ongoing initiatives which you can find on the public Jenkins roadmap\n(in the draft stage, see jep:14[]).\nSome stories:\n\nGeneral availability of Windows images.\n\nSupport for more platforms (AArch64, IBM s390x, PowerPC).\n\nSwitching to AdoptOpenJDK.\n\nIntroducing multi-platform Docker images.\n\nIf you are interested in any of these projects and would like to contribute,\nplease reach out to the Platform Special Interest Group which coordinates initiatives related to Jenkins in Docker.\n\nRegarding the agent terminology cleanup outside Docker images,\nwe will keep working on this project in the Advocacy & Outreach SIG.\nIf you see the usage of the obsolete \"slave\" term anywhere in the Jenkins organization (Web UI, documentation, etc.),\nplease feel free to submit a pull request or to report an issue in the jira:JENKINS-42816[Slave to Agent renaming leftovers] EPIC.\nThere are \"just\" 3000 occurences left in the jenkinsci GitHub organization, but we will get there.\nAny contributions will be appreciated!","title":"Docker images for agents: New names and What's

addition to WAR files and Docker images, the Jenkins project provides native installers for each weekly and LTS release.\nThere are installers available for Linux distributions, Windows, macOS and other operating systems.\nThere are also installers provided by third parties.\nYou can find the list of these installers on the Downloads page.\n\nIn this blog post, we announce the upcoming deprecation of the macOS native installer.\nWe will review the replacement options and the rollout plan.\n\nWhy?\n\nMaintaining installers is a significant maintenance effort for the project\nbecause installers require testing and, sometimes, specific platforms and environments for packaging.\nWhen installers lose relevance for the majority of the Jenkins audience, we remove them or handover maintenance to third parties on other areas.\nFor macOS, there are currently two types of packages: native installers with GUI for desktop versions and Homebrew packages.\nSince Homebrew is now a defacto standard package manager for macOS users, from the Jenkins standpoint it made sense to deprecate the native installers.\n\nWhy now?\nThere is ongoing work on automating Jenkins Core releases within the Jenkins infrastructure.\nLong story short, we are moving Jenkins release pipelines to Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure.\nThis environment does not offer macOS machines that are needed to produce native installers.\nIf you are interested to know more, there will be a How Jenkins Builds and Delivers Jenkins in the Cloud talk presented by Olivier Vernin at DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Europe in Lisbon (use the JWFOSS code for a 30% discount!).\n\nWe could have used an external service for building macOS installers,\nbut it would have added an additional point of failure and implementation/maintenance overhead.\nSo we discussed it in the developer mailing list and agreed that it is better to just deprecate and then remove the packages.\n\nReplacing native installers\n\nIn the case of macOS, there are two main alternatives available: managing the service manually or migrating to Homebrew packages.\nBefore doing a migration, we highly recommend backing up your instance.\n\nManaging Jenkins with WAR file on macOS\n\nIf your Jenkins instance was previously set up with a native installer,\nto update Jenkins it will be enough to replace the jenkins.war file in the installation directory and restart the instance.\nThe services will keep running as it was configured before the migration.\nThe default installation directory is /Applications/Jenkins/jenkins.war\n\nManaging Jenkins with Homebrew\n\nInstalling Jenkins with Homebrew is a way to go for those who want to install Jenkins using a package manager.\nThere are two Homebrew formulas for Jenkins: jenkins for Weekly releases and jenkins-lts for LTS ones.\nThese packages are supported by a third party (Homebrew community),\nand they may be not as frequently updated as packages supported by the Jenkins project directly.\n\nBefore doing a migration from macOS Native installers to HomeBrew, please make sure to backup your Jenkins instance.\nThere are no automatic migration tools available, and the installation may corrupt your JENKINS_HOME or service configuration files in edge cases.\n\nIf you switch to Homebrew, you will need to properly migrate the JENKINS_HOME data to the new location.\nWe do not provide an official migration guide, but it is possible to find some guidelines on the Web.\n\nSample commands:\n\nInstall the latest Weekly version: brew install jenkins\n\nInstall a specific Weekly version: brew install jenkins@YOUR_VERSION\n\nStart the Jenkins service: brew services start jenkins\n\nRestart the Jenkins service: brew services restart jenkins\n\nUpdate the Jenkins version: brew upgrade jenkins\n\nFor more information see the documentation for Homebrew packages on the macOS Download pages.\n\nRollout plan\n\nmacOS native packaging is considered as deprecated starting from Jenkins 2.206 and Jenkins LTS 2.204.1\n\nFor Jenkins Weekly macOS native packaging will be removed with the switch to the new Jenkins release

end of the first GSoC phase, I\nannounced\nthe first alpha release of the CLI tool and library that will help centralize\nplugin management and make plugin tooling easier.\n\nPhase 2 has mainly been focused on improving upon the initial CLI and library written\nin Coding Phase 1. In particular, we’ve been focusing on getting the tool ready to\nincorporate into the Jenkins Docker Image to replace the\ninstall-plugins.sh bash script\nto download plugins.  This work included parsing improvements so that blank lines and comments in the\nplugins.txt file are filtered out, allowing update centers and the plugin download\ndirectory to be set via environment variables or CLI Options, creating Windows\ncompatible defaults, and fixing a bug in which dependencies for specific\nplugin versions were not always getting resolved correctly.\n\nIn parallel to getting the tool ready for Jenkins Docker integration, Phase 2 saw\nthe addition of several new features.\n\nYaml Input\n\nIn addition to specifying the plugins they want to download via the --plugins\nCLI option or through a .txt file, users can now use a Jenkins yaml file with a\nplugins root element.\n\nSay goodbye to the days of specifying incremental\nplugins like incrementals;org.jenkins-ci.plugins.workflow;2.20-rc530.b4f7f7869384 -\n  you can enter the artifactId, groupId, and version to specify an incremental plugin.\n\nMaking the Download Process More Transparent\n\nPreviously, the plugin download process was not very transparent to users - it was\ndifficult to know the final set of plugins that would be downloaded after pulling in\nall the dependencies.  Instead of determing the set of plugins that will be downloaded\nat the time of download, users now have the option to see the full set of plugins\nand their versions that will be downloaded in advance. With the --list CLI\noption, users can see all currently downloaded and bundled plugins, the set of all\nplugins that will be downloaded, and the effective plugin set - the set of all\nplugins that are already downloaded or will be downloaded.\n\nViewing Information About plugins\n\nNow that you know which plugins will be downloaded, wouldn’t it be nice to know\nif these are the latest versions or if any of the versions you want to install have\nsecurity warnings?  You can do that now too.\n\nNext Steps and Additional Information\n\nThe updates mentioned in this blog will be released soon so you can try them out.\nThe focus of Phase 3 will be to continue to iterate upon and improve the library\nand CLI. We hope to release a first version and submit a pull request to Jenkins Docker soon.\nThanks to everyone who has already tried it out and given feedback! I will also be\npresenting my work at DevOps World\nin San Francisco in a few weeks.  You can use the code PREVIEW for a discounted registration\n($799 instead of $1,499).\n\nFeel free to reach out through\nthe Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list. I would love to get your questions, comments, and feedback!\nWe have meetings Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6PM UTC.\n\nPhase 2 Presentation Slides\n\nPhase 2 Recorded Demo\n\nJira Issue Search\n\nRepository","title":"Plugin Management Library and CLI Tool Phase 2 GSoC Updates","tags":["plugins","pluginmanagement","platform-sig","cli","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#280818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/405b9/stopalopa.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7b6be/stopalopa.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/ebcfb/stopalopa.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/0ade5/stopalopa.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/5b0b1/stopalopa.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/96834/stopalopa.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/805f6/stopalopa.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":184}}},"blog":null,"github":"stopalopa","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Natasha is a Master&#8217;s student at Penn State University.

We instead decided to start by converting the\ninstall-plugins.sh bash script in Jenkins Docker to Java.\nThere are several issues with the install-plugins.sh script - namely, that it is a bash script and has limited extensibility.\nFurthermore, it does not retrieve all of the most-up-to-date update center metadata.\n\nAlpha Release Details\n\nMimicking what was done in the install-plugins.sh script from the official Jenkins Docker image, the new plugin management library takes in a list of plugins, their versions,\nand/or urls from which to download the plugins, and downloads the requested plugins and their dependencies. The plugins are downloaded from the update center\nto a specified directory, and can then be loaded into Jenkins. Currently, the plugins to be downloaded can be specified via a plugins.txt file and/or the -plugins cli option, but we plan to further expand the input formats that can be accepted.\nCustom version specifiers for different update centers are also supported.\n\nThe library will first check if any of the requested plugins are currently either installed in the user-specified download location or user-specified Jenkins war file.\nAlready installed plugins will be ignored or upgraded if a higher version is requested or required as a dependency.  After determining the plugin download URL, the library\nwill download the plugins and resolve and download their dependencies.\n\nThis is just the beginning: the plugin manager library and cli tool are very much still a work in progress.\nFor the most up-to-date information on CLI options and how to run the tool, see the repository README.md.\nMore robust input parsing, support for security warnings and available updates, Docker integration, and additional features coming soon!\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nFeel free to reach out through\nthe Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list.

is a joint blog post prepared by the Java 11 Support Team: Adrien Lecharpentier, Ashton Treadway, Baptiste Mathus, Jenn Briden, Kevin Earls, María Isabel Vilacides, Mark Waite, Ramón León and Oleg Nenashev.\n\nWe have worked hard for this and it’s now here.\nWe are thrilled to announce full support for Java 11 in Jenkins starting from Jenkins 2.164 (released on Feb 10, 2019) and LTS 2.164.1 (ETA: March 14th).\nThis means you can now run your Jenkins controllers and agents with a Java 11 JVM.\n\nStarting in June 2018, many events were organized to improve Jenkins code base and add Java 11 support.\nBeyond these events, Core/Plugins maintainers and many other contributors have worked hard to make sure they discover and solve as many issues as possible related to Java 11 support.\n\nThe effort to support Java 11 led to the creation of the JEP-211: Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nIt also spurred the creation of the Platform Special Interest Group to coordinate the Java 11 work and other platform support efforts.\n\nCelebration\n\nWe’d like to take a moment to thank everyone involved in these tasks: code contributors, issue reporters, testers, event planners and attendees and all those in the community who have generously lent their time and support to this effort.\nThank you all!\n\nHere are some of the contributors who helped with this task (alphabetical order):\n\nAlex Earl,\nAlyssa Tong,\nAshton Treadway,\nBaptiste Mathus,\nCarlos Sanchez,\nDaniel Beck,\nDavid Aldrich,\nDenis Digtyar,\nDevin Nusbaum,\nEmeric Vernat,\nEvaristo Gutierrez,\nGavin Mogan,\nGianpaolo

Hafner,\nVincent Latombe,\nWadeck Follonier\n\n(We are deeply sorry if we missed anyone in this list.)\n\nGuidelines\n\nIn order to keep it simple, here is how you can start Jenkins on Java 11 using the Docker image.\nYou can select a Java 11 based image by suffixing the tag of the image with -jdk11.\nIf you are upgrading an existing instance please read the Upgrading Jenkins Java version from 8 to 11 page before upgrading.\n\nSo you can run Jenkins on Java 11 with:\n\ndocker run -p 50000:50000 -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:2.164-jdk11\n\nHowever, and as always, you can still start Jenkins with other methods.\nPlease see the more detailed documentation at Running Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nDeveloper guidelines\n\nFor developers involved in Jenkins development, you can find details on developing and testing Jenkins to run on Java 11 on the Java 11 Developer Guidelines.\n\nThis resource regroups the modifications which might need to be done in order to validate the compatibility of plugins for Java 11.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nEven though this is a big achievement, we still have work to do.\n\nOur first priority is adding Java 11 support to JenkinsFile Runner project.\nFrom there, we will move on to port Java 11 support to the Jenkins X project and the Evergreen project.\n\nSo, even if this is a big deal to us, this is not the end of the story.\nIt is a major step that will benefit users, developers, and members of the Jenkins community.\n\nReference links\n\nRunning Jenkins on Java
