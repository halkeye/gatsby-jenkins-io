We have not yet set any kind of agenda, but some core Hudson hackers and plenty of plugin developers should be in town so it should be a great time hacking on and/or with Hudson.\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/hudsonmeetup/calendar/14515128/\n\nWhen: September 19th, 1:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Digg’s Office: 1040 Mariposa St - Suite 100, San Francisco, CA 94107\nhttps://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=embed&hl=en&geocode=&q=1040+Mariposa+St+-+Suite+100+San+Francisco,+CA+94107&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=39.780156,78.662109&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1040+Mariposa+St,+San+Francisco,+California+94107&ll=37.764201,-122.394304&spn=0.020356,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=A\n\nUnlike last year, we’re trying to organize this with Meetup.com, if you experience any difficulties RSVPing let us know","title":"Pre-JavaOne Hudson Meetup","tags":["general","just for fun","meetup","javaone"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"javaone","limit":8,"skip":16,"numPages":3,"currentPage":3}},
