Most of these plugins are developed by third party developers or companies and can assist the user in a range of ways. They can extend the core functions, they can offer solutions to repetitive tasks or they can help with using a service. For example, they could help with publishing to an artifact store or spinning up cloud instances. However, before a plugin can use a network based service that requires credentials to connect, those credentials have to be typed in and saved somewhere. This raises the question, are those credentials stored securely? Or not?\nWhen I started looking at different plugins this was one of the first areas I investigated. I found a Jenkins security advisory describing this issue and came to the conclusion that this could be a problem in some plugins, albeit one that could be fixed easily. I found an example of weakly stored credentials in the Publish Over Dropbox Plugin; this plugin used a simple web form with a textbox element to display the token in the plugin’s settings page. This token was stored in plaintext:\n\nThe following Jelly code was behind the web form and shows that a password field wasn’t used:\n\nThe related plugin .xml file contained the secret key in plaintext:\n\nGLOBAL\nwoodspeed\n\nlYD2VnNz\nlYD2VnNz\n\nJenkins offers at least two ways to store credentials in an encrypted format:\n\nUsing a Secret type offered by Jenkins\n\nThird party plugin called Credentials Plugin\n\nThe first case is the easiest solution, because Jenkins will automatically handle the encryption and decryption.\n\nDevelopers should also use the password field tag instead of the textbox field, as shown in the following Jelly control example:\n\nIf you would like to know what other vulnerabilities I discovered and how to fix them, come and join us for the presentation in Lisbon!\nIn case you are unable to attend the conference, you can read more at Story of a Hundred Vulnerable Jenkins Plugins.","title":"Do Plugins Store Credentials In A Secure Way? -

attendees with the opportunity to learn, explore, network\nface-to-face and help shape the next evolution of Jenkins development and solutions for DevOps.\n\nThere is also the Jenkins Contributor Summit in San Francisco. The Jenkins Contributor Summit is the place where\ncurrent and future contributors get together to discuss, learn and collaborate on the latest and greatest efforts within\nJenkins project. The morning portion of the summit is a mix of presentations by the core contributors. The\npresentations highlight what each effort is about and what community members can do to help. In the\nafternoon breakout sessions with  Birds of a Feather tables for in-depth discussion, and collaboration with sub-project\ncontributors.\n\nI feel very honored to have been a part of this.\n\nDay 1\n\nDay one started with the contributor summit. This was a chance for everyone to get together and talk about\ncontributions and put faces to names. Most people I had only met via video chat or on gitter so I was super excited.\nWe gathered to hear about the start of the Jenkins open source landscape.\n\nNext up was the BoF/Unconference. I was leading these sessions and I felt they went really well.\nWe had fellow org admins Martin d’Anjou and Jeff Pearce give a talk about Google Summer of Code projects.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code student Natasha Stopa presented her project, Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool. This is\na super cool project and very well received in the community.\n\nWe closed out the session with a presentation from Steven Terrana from Booz Allen Hamilton and the awesome Jenkins\nTemplating Engine. If you have not had a chance to try this, please make sure you do at https://github.com/boozallen/jenkins-templating-engine.\n\nMain Expo Hall\n\nDay two and onward saw me and other Jenkins org admins in the Ask the Expert booth for the Jenkins community.\n\nThis was a really cool experience and gave me a chance to hear about things the community is working on and help with\nissues they are facing.\nThere were a range of questions from Jenkins X to many of the plugins I maintain such and the Jenkins Prometheus and the\nSysdig Secure Scanning plugins.\nThere were also a lot of Kubernetes questions. There is a lot of marketing data regarding the increased usage of\nKubernetes but I was seriously surprised by the massive interest in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nOf course there were opportunities for selfie requests.\n\nLunch time demos got underway and we had a busy schedule.\nFirst up was the awesome Mark Waite to talk about the\nGit plugin. A lot of people use git in\nJenkins.\nThank you so much for all that you do Mark.\n\nJenkins org admin Martin d’Anjou was next on deck to talk about the Google Summer of Code. So amazing to think that the\nGoogle Summer of Code is also in its 15th year like Jenkins!\n\nNatasha Stopa is a Google Summer of Code student and she presented her project Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool.\nNatasha really put a lot of hard work in to this plugin and it was really awesome to see the turn out and support during\nher presentation.\n\nFinally there was me. I presented the Sysdig Secure Scanning Jenkins plugin which I am a maintainer of. I thank everyone who attended\n\nRight after the lunch time demos I also oversaw the Jenkins open space. This was an opportunity for the community to talk\nabout items and let them flow organically. I really enjoyed this session and felt it was also well received.\n\nWe closed out the day and the event with a picture of some of the Jenkins org admins and Google Summer of Code students.\nMissing from this photos are fellow org admins, Lloyd Chang and Oleg Nenashev\n\nClosing\n\nThis was an amazing experience. Huge thanks to CloudBees, the Jenkins community, Google Summer of Code, Tracy Miranda,\nAlyssa Tong and my employer Sysdig.\n\nTo think Jenkins is 15 years old is amazing!

It was\nan amazing experience getting to meet people from all over world who are trying\nto make the development and release process easier and more efficient. I enjoyed\nlearning more about industry tools, processes, and standards, and meeting CI/CD\nexperts and contributors in the open source community.\n\nBelow is a summary of my experience. Thank you to the Jenkins project and CloudBees for making\n my trip and attendance possible!\n\nDay 1\n\nMonday was the Continuous Delivery Contributor Summit, which focused on projects\nunder the CDF umbrella.  After checking in and grabbing my badge, I was able to\nmeet up with some of the Google Summer of Code org admins. It was great\nbeing able to actually meet them in person after talking to them over video\nconferencing and chats all summer!\n\nTracy Miranda started the summit out by introducing the Continuous Delivery Foundation,\nwhich aims to provide a vendor neutral home to help and sustain open source projects\nfocusing on all aspects of continuous delivery.  Currently, Jenkins, Tekton, Spinnaker,\nand JenkinsX have joined the foundation.  Project updates were given for Jenkins,\nTekton, and JenkinsX.  In the afternoon, attendees split into different groups for\nunconference sessions.  I presented my project to the Jenkins group.  Afterwards,\nthere was free time to chat with other attendees about my project and the other Jenkins\nprojects. Lastly, lightning talks were given before everyone headed to the contributor\nappreciation event to grab some food and drinks.\n\nDay 2\n\nI attended the Jenkins Pipeline Fundamentals Short Course in the morning. Even\nthough I’m working on a project for Jenkins, there’s still a lot I don’t know so\nI just wanted to try to learn more.\n\nA lot of the afternoon sessions filled up, so I spent the afternoon trying to meet\nother people at the conference, before heading to the keynote. The keynote\ntalked more about the CDF and some of the backstory behind its origin.  This year is also a big anniversary for Jenkins - it has now been\naround for 15 years.\n\nAfter the keynote, I checked out a Women in Tech mixer and\nthe opening of the exibition hall. Probably my favorite swag I picked up was the\n\"Will Code for Beer\" stickers and a bottle of hot sauce.\n\nDay 3\n\nThe morning began with another keynote. Shawn Ahmed of CloudBees talked about the\nchallenges of visibility into bottlenecks of the development process and Rajeev Mahajan\ndiscussed how HSBC tackled DevOps.  The rest of the day I attended different sessions\non container tooling, implementing CI/CD in a cloud native environment, running\nJenkins on Jenkins, and database DevOps.\n\nAfter the sessions finished, I wandered\naround the expo until it closed, then joined some of the other conference attendees\nto have some fun at a ping pong bar nearby.\n\nDay 4\n\nThe final and last day of the conference was probably my favorite.  The morning\nkeynote revealed that Zhao Xiaojie had won an award for his work on Jenkins advocacy,\nsome other DevOps award panelists talked about their approaches to different challenges,\nthen David Stanke gave an enjoyable presentation about cloud native CI/CD. I was\nable to present my summer project and attend a few more sessions, including one\nabout DevOps at scale, and another about use cases for machine learning in CI/CD pipelines.\n\nThe last keynote given by James Governor was a thoughtful look into the current and\nfuture states of tech. How does tech look like it will scale in the coming years\nin the U.S. and across the world? How can we make tech more inclusive and accessible?\nWhat can we do to minimize our environmental footprint?  In particular, his points\non welcoming people from a non-traditional computer science background resonated with\nme since I’m currently undergoing my own career transition to tech.\n\nAfter the conference ended, I said goodbye to the remaining GSoC org admins before\nmeeting an old friend for dinner and bringing along some new friends I met at the\nconference.  I spent the remaining part of the night singing karaoke with\nthem before heading out of San Francisco the next morning.\n\nThanks again to everyone who supported me and encouraged me leading up to and during\nmy presentation, patiently answered my questions as I tried to gather more context\nabout CI/CD tools and practices, and made my first DevOps conference so enjoyable!","title":"My DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 Experience","tags":["pluginmanagement","devopsworld2019","gsoc","gsoc2019","community","events"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#280818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/405b9/stopalopa.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7b6be/stopalopa.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/ebcfb/stopalopa.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/0ade5/stopalopa.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/5b0b1/stopalopa.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/96834/stopalopa.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/805f6/stopalopa.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":184}}},"blog":null,"github":"stopalopa","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Natasha is a Master&#8217;s student at Penn State University.
