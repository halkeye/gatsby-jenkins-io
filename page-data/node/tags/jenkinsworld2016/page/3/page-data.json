There is likely a constrained\ntool set to support - not an abundance of flavors of applications and security\npractices - and generally fewer cooks in the kitchen. But in a larger\norganization, I have found that in the past, there were seemingly endless\nunique requirements and mountains to climb to reach this level of automation on\neach new project.\n\nNeil will be presenting more\nof this concept at Jenkins World in\nSeptember, register with the code JWFOSS for a 20% discount off your pass.\n\nEnter the Jenkins Pipeline plugin. My recently departed former company, a large\nfinancial services organization with a 600+ person IT organization and 150+\napplication portfolio, set out to implement continuous delivery\nenterprise-wide. After considering several pipeline orchestration tools, we\ndetermined the Pipeline plugin (at the time called Workflow) to be the superior\nsolution for our company. Pipeline has continued Jenkins' legacy of presenting\nan extensible platform with just the right set of features to allow\norganizations to scale its capabilities as they see fit, and do so rapidly. As\nearly adopters of Pipeline with a protracted set of requirements, we used it\nboth to accelerate the pace of onboarding new projects and to reduce the\nongoing feature delivery time of our applications.\n\nIn my presentation at Jenkins World, I will demonstrate the methods we used to\nenable this. A few examples:\n\nWe leveraged the Pipeline Remote File Loader plugin to write shared common\ncode and sought and received community enhancements to these functions.\n\nJenkinsfile, loading a shared AWS utilities function library\n\nawsUtils.groovy, snippets of some AWS functions\n\nWe migrated from EC2 agents to Docker-based agents running on Amazon’s\nElastic Container Service, allowing us to spin up new executors in seconds\nand for teams to own their own executor definitions.\n\nPipeline run #1 using standard EC2 executors, spinning up EC2 instance for each\nnode; Pipeline run #2 using shared ECS cluster with near-instant instantiation\nof a Docker agent in the cluster for each node.\n\nWe also created a Pipeline Library of common pipelines, enabling projects\nthat fit certain models to use ready-made end-to-end pipelines. Some\nexamples:\n\nMaven JAR Pipeline: Pipeline that clones git repository, builds JAR file\nfrom pom.xml, deploys to Artifactory, and runs maven release plugin to\nincrement next version\n\nAnuglar.JS Pipeline: Pipeline that executes a grunt and bower build, then\nruns S3 sync to Amazon S3 bucket in Dev, then Stage, then Prod buckets.\n\nPentaho Reports Pipeline: Pipeline that clones git repository, constructs\nzip file, and executes Pentaho Business Intelligence Platform CLI to import new\nset of reports in Dev, Stage, then Prod servers.\n\nPerhaps most critically, a shout-out to the saving grace of this quest for our\nsecurity and ops teams: the manual 'input' step! While the ambition of\ncontinuous delivery is to have as few of these as possible, this was the\nsingle-most pivotal feature in convincing others of Pipeline’s viability, since\nnow any step of the delivery process could be gate-checked by an LDAP-enabled\npermission group. Were it not for the availability of this step, we may still\nbe living in the world of: \"This seems like a great tool for development, but\nwe will have a segregated process for production deployments.\" Instead, we had\na pipeline full of many 'input' steps at first, and then used the data we\ncollected around the longest delays to bring management focus to them and unite\neveryone around the goal of strategically removing them, one by one.\n\nGoing forward, having recently joined Aquilent’s Cloud Solutions Architecture\nteam, I’ll be working with our project teams here to further mature the use of\nthese Pipeline plugin features as we move towards continuous delivery. Already,\nwe have migrated several components of our healthcare.gov project to Pipeline.\nThe team has been able to consolidate several Jenkins jobs into a single,\nvisible delivery pipeline, to maintain the lifecycle of the pipeline with our\napplication code base in our SCM, and to more easily integrate with our\nexternal tools.\n\nDue to functional shortcomings in the early adoption stages of the Pipeline\nplugin and the ever-present political challenges of shifting organizational\npolicy, this has been and continues to be far from a bruise-free journey. But\nwe plodded through many of these issues to bring this to fruition and\nultimately reduced the number of manual steps in some pipelines from 12 down to\n1 and brought our 20+ Jenkins-minute pipelines to only six minutes after months\nof iteration. I hope you’ll join this session at Jenkins World and learn about\nour challenges and successes in achieving the promise of continuous delivery at\nenterprise scale.","title":"Continuously Delivering Continuous Delivery Pipelines","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/author/hinman","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9a0e4574-a766-5c76-b7d9-8fc1d1fbcde3","slug":"/blog/2016/08/11/speaker-blog-edx-jenkins-world/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Ben Patterson, Engineering Manager at\nedX.\n\nPicking a pear from a basket is straightforward when you can hold it in your hand, feel its weight, perhaps give a gentle squeeze, observe its color and look more closely at any bruises. If the only information we had was a photograph from one angle, we’d have to do some educated guessing.\n\nAs developers, we don’t get a photograph; we get a green checkmark or a red x. We use that to decide whether or not we need to switch gears and go back to a pull request we submitted recently. At edX, we take advantage of some Jenkins features that could give us more granularity on GitHub pull requests, and make that decision less of a guessing game.\n\nMultiple contexts reporting back when they’re available\n\nPull requests on our platform are evaluated from several angles: static code analysis including linting and security audits, javascript unit tests, python unit tests, acceptance tests and accessibility tests. Using an elixir of plugins, including the GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin, we put more direct feedback into the hands of the contributor so s/he can quickly decide how much digging is going to be needed.\n\nFor example, if I made adjustments to my branch and know more requirements are coming, then I may not be as worried about passing the linter; however, if my unit tests have failed, I likely have a problem I need to address regardless of when the new requirements arrive. Timing is important as well. Splitting out the contexts means we can run tests in parallel and report results faster.\n\nDevelopers can re-run specific contexts\n\nOccasionally the feedback mechanism fails. It is oftentimes a flaky condition in a test or in test setup. (Solving flakiness is a different discussion I’m sidestepping. Accept the fact that the system fails for purposes of this blog entry.) Engineers are armed with the power of re-running specific contexts, also available through the PR plugin. A developer can say “jenkins run bokchoy” to re-run the acceptance tests, for example. A developer can also re-run everything with “jenkins run all”. These phrases are set through the GitHub Pull Request Builder configuration.\n\nMore granular data is easier to find for our Tools team\n\nSplitting the contexts has also given us important data points for our Tools team to help in highlighting things like flaky tests, time to feedback and other metrics that help the org prioritize what’s important. We use this with a log aggregator (in our case, Splunk) to produce valuable reports such as this one.\n\nI could go on! The short answer here is we have an intuitive way of divvying up our tests, not only for optimizing the overall amount of time it takes to get build results, but also to make the experience more user-friendly to developers.\n\nBen will be presenting more on this topic at\nJenkins World in September,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 20% discount off your pass.","title":"Using Jenkins for Disparate Feedback on GitHub","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/author/hinman","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"61a711c9-9de6-5990-b29e-67f3bac971b1","slug":"/blog/2016/07/26/join-me-at-jenkinsworld/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins World, September\n13-15 at the Santa Clara Convention Center (SCCC), takes our 6th annual\ncommunity user conference to a whole new level. It will be one big party for\neverything Jenkins, from users to developers, from the community to vendors.\nThere will be more of what people always loved in past user conferences, such\nas technical sessions from users and developers, the Ask the Experts booth and\nplugin development workshop, and even more has been added, such as Jenkins\ntraining pre-conference, workshops and the opportunity to get certified for\nfree. Jenkins World is a not-to-be-missed.\n\nFor me, the best part of Jenkins World is the opportunity to meet other Jenkins\nusers and developers face-to-face. We all interact on IRC, Google Groups or\nGitHub, but when you have a chance to meet in person, the person behind the\nGitHub ID or IRC name, whose plugin you use every day, becomes a real person.\nYour motivation might be a little different from mine, but we have the breath\nin the agenda to cover everyone from new users to senior plugin developers.\n\nThis year, you’ll have more opportunities than ever before to learn about\nJenkins and continuous delivery/DevOps practices, and explore what Jenkins has\nto offer.\n\nIf you are travelling from somewhere, you might as well get a two-day Jenkins training course to be held onsite, starting Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, you can attend your choice of workshops, which gives you more hands-on time to go deeper, including:\n\nThe DevOps Toolkit 2.0 Workshop\n\nLet’s Build a Jenkins Pipeline\n\nPreparing for Jenkins Certification\n\nIntro to Plugin Development\n\nCD and DevOps Maturity for Managers\n\nOn Wednesday, the formal conference kicks off. Throughout Wednesday and\nThursday, you can choose from sessions spread across five tracks and covering\na diverse range of topics like infrastructure as code, security, containers,\npipeline automation, best practices, scaling Jenkins and new community\ndevelopment initiatives.\n\nAt Jenkins World, you’ll be exposed to projects going on in the community such\nas Blue Ocean, a new Jenkins UX project. You can\nlearn more about Jenkins 2 - a major release for the project, and based on the\nhuge number of downloads we saw in the weeks following its introduction at the\nend of April, it was a big +1. At Jenkins World, you will be immersed in\nJenkins and community, and leave knowing that you are part of a meaningful open\nsource project that, with your involvement, can do anything!\n\nThis year there will only be one Jenkins World conference, so that everyone\ninvolved in Jenkins can get together in one place at one time and actually see\neach other. I understand that it might be a bit more difficult for Jenkins\nusers outside of the US to make it to Jenkins World, but hopefully we made the\nevent worth your visit. As the final push on the back, CloudBees has created a\nspecial international program\nfor those who are coming from outside the United States.  You’ll have\ntime to talk with all of the other Jenkins users who have made the journey from\nacross the globe, you’ll be able to attend exclusive networking events and\nmore.\n\nI hope to see you September 13th through 15th in Santa Clara at\nJenkins World in Santa Clara!\n\nRegister for Jenkins World in\nSeptember with the code JWFOSS for a 20% discount off your pass.","title":"Join me for Jenkins World 2016","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":"c98c0308-267c-58ea-bd87-6999a646f331","slug":"/blog/2016/04/14/jenkins-world-registration-is-open/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Alyssa Tong.\nAlyssa works for CloudBees, helping to organize\nJenkins community events around the\nworld.\n\nJenkins World 2016 will be the largest gathering of Jenkins users in the world.
