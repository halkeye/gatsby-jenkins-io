Tyler Croy, who is a\nlong-time contributor to Jenkins and the primary contact for Jenkins project\ninfrastructure. He is also a Jenkins Evangelist at\nCloudBees, Inc.\n\nI have been heavily using Jenkins Pipeline for just about\nevery Jenkins-related project I have contributed to over the past year. Whether I am\nbuilding and publishing Docker\ncontainers, testing\ninfrastructure code or\npublishing this very web\nsite, I have been adding a Jenkinsfile to nearly every Git repository I\ntouch.\n\nImplementing Pipeline has been rewarding, but has not been without its own\nchallenges. That’s why I’m excited to see lots of different Jenkins Pipeline\nrelated content in the agenda at\nJenkins World.\n\nI don’t think it’s possible for a single person to attend all of the Pipeline\ntalks, or the Pipeline-related demos\nin the \"Open Source Hub\", but fortunately CloudBees\nwill be recording the sessions. If you have Pipeline-related questions unanswered by\nall these presentations, feel free to join us at the \"Open Source Hub\" in the\nexpo hall and Ask the\nExperts.\n\nOn the first day of Jenkins World (September 13th), Isaac Cohen is hosting a\nworkshop titled\nLet’s\nBuild a Jenkins Pipeline which may be interesting to you if you haven’t yet\nworked with Pipeline.\n\nPipelining\nDevOps with Jenkins and AWS\n\nSeptember 14th 2:00 PM - 2:45 PM, Exhibit Hall A-1\n\nAutomated workflow is a proven method for removing process variability. DevOps\npipelines are the next step in the evolution of CI/CD/DevOps. This talk covers\nJenkins pipelines, both with and without AWS integration, and explains how\nJenkins can be used to create, execute and manage pipelines.\n\n— Jimmy Ray of nextSource\n\nPerfecting\nYour Development Tools: Updates to the Helix Plugin for Jenkins\n\nSeptember 14th 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM, Exhibit Hall C\n\nConsidering a mono repo that can manage all your source code, binary and other\nassets? Join us at the Perforce Birds of a Feather Session for updates and\ndiscussions around the Helix Plugin for Jenkins (or ‘P4 plugin’).\n\nThis session will look at the latest DSL PipeLine support in the ‘P4 plugin’\nfor Jenkins and will include a live demo. We will show you how to map your\nBranches and Streams into a Jenkins Workspace, publish assets back into\nHelix, and more. You may even get a sneak preview at the latest ‘P4 plugin’\nfor Jenkins that allows you the freedom to query and run commands from\nwithin Jenkins directly against your Helix connection.\n\n— Paul Allen of Perforce\n\nContinuously\nDeploying Containers with Jenkins Pipeline to Docker Swarm Cluster\n\nSeptember 14th 3:00 PM - 3:45 PM, Exhibit Hall A-3\n\nMany of us have already experimented with Docker - for example, by running one\nof the pre-built images from Docker Hub. It is possible that your team might\nhave recognized the benefits that Docker provides in building microservices and\nthe advantages the technology could bring to development, testing, integration\nand, ultimately, production. However, you must create a comprehensive build\npipeline before deploying any containers into a live environment. Integrating\ncontainers into a CD pipeline is far from easy. Along with the benefits Docker\nbrings, there are challenges both technically and process-related. This\npresentation attempts to outline the steps you need to take for a\nfully-automated Jenkins pipeline that continuously builds, tests and deploys\nmicroservices into a Docker Swarm cluster.\n\n— Viktor Farcic\n\nNo,\nYou Shouldn’t Do That! Lessons from Using Pipeline\n\nSeptember 15th 10:30 AM - 11:15 AM, Exhibit Hall A-1\n\nPipeline is as powerful as a loaded gun, but with skill can be as delicate as a\nsurgeon’s knife. This talk will give an overview of health and safety so that\nyou can avoid shooting yourself in the head and walk the path to medical\nschool. It will cover not only what not to do, but also why, and share some\nsolutions so you are not left high and dry. Both James and Bobby have bullet\nwounds from “Champagning” pipeline to automate the test and release of several\nof the CloudBees products and can occasionally still be seen walking with a\nlimp from shooting for the moon and hitting their feet.\n\n— Bobby Sandell and James T. Nord of CloudBees\n\nDocker\nImage Lifecycle Implemented with Jenkins Pipeline\n\nSeptember 15th 11:30 AM - 12:15 PM, Exhibit Hall A-2\n\nWhile Docker has enabled an unprecedented velocity of software production, it\nis all too easy to spin out of control. A promotion-based model is required to\ncontrol and track the flow of Docker images as much as it is required for a\ntraditional software development lifecycle. We will demonstrate how to go from\ndevelopment to containerization to distribution utilizing binary management\npromotion in a framework implemented on Jenkins, using the Pipeline\nfunctionality.\n\n— Mark Galpin\n\nDirections for Pipeline\n\nSeptember 15th 11:30 AM - 12:15 PM, Exhibit Hall A-1\n\nThe Pipeline feature has matured and is now included in Jenkins 2.0. During the\ntime since its release, copious user feedback has been received about missing\nfeatures and pain points. Come hear about some things we know should be worked\non - or are already in progress - and bring your suggestions.\n\n— Jesse Glick of CloudBees\n\nHow\nto Do Continuous Delivery with Jenkins Pipeline, Docker and Kubernetes\n\nSeptember 15th 2:30 PM - 3:15 PM, Great America J\n\nIn this talk, we’ll show how to use Jenkins Pipeline together with Docker and\nKubernetes to implement a complete end-to-end continuous delivery and\ncontinuous improvement system for microservices and monolithic applications\nusing open source software. We’ll demonstrate how to easily create new\nmicroservices projects or import existing projects, have them automatically\nbuilt, system and integration tested, staged and then deployed. Once deployed,\nwe will also see how to manage and update applications using continuous\ndelivery practices along with integrated ChatOps - all completely automated!\n\n— James Strachan of Red Hat\n\nIntroducing\na New Way to Define Jenkins Pipelines\n\nSeptember 15th 3:45 PM - 4:30 PM, Great America J\n\nPipeline is quickly establishing itself as the direction that Jenkins jobs are\ngoing, enabling the definition of a complete CD pipeline in a single job;\nPipeline as Code via the “Jenkinsfile”; job durability across controller restarts;\nand more. I’ll be talking here about the next evolution for Pipeline: a simple,\ndeclarative model to define your Pipelines with no need to write scripts. This\nconfiguration syntax for Pipeline allows you to automatically configure all\nstages of your pipeline, the complete build environment, post-build actions,\nnotifications and more. All while providing syntactic and semantic validation\nbefore the build actually gets going.\n\n— Andrew Bayer of CloudBees\n\nThe\nNeed For Speed: Building Pipelines To Be Faster\n\nSeptember 15th 4:45 PM - 5:30 PM, Exhibit Hall A-1\n\nResponse time is paramount for a CI/CD system. In this session, you will see\nhow a few best practices in constructing pipelines can yield faster turnaround\ntimes and reduced resource use. We’ll also run through plugins and tools to\nanalyze and visualize performance, including the Pipeline Stage View plugin. If\ntime permits, we may briefly discuss some of the computer science theory behind\ndifferent aspects of performance.\n\n— Sam Van Oort of CloudBees\n\nContinuously Delivering\nContinuous Delivery Pipelines\n\nSeptember 15th 4:45 PM - 5:30 PM, Exhibit Hall J\n\nOur 600-person IT organization has committed to implementing continuous\ndelivery practices enterprise-wide. This isn’t a single momentous event put in\nplace overnight. Rather, it’s a strategic journey towards a common goal, and\nthrough which each application will take its own unique path. A seminal\ncomponent of our CD journey is the Pipeline plugin and it has become our\nstandard for CD pipeline orchestration. We will discuss a few of the diverse\npaths taken by the application teams at our company and show how the use of the\nPipeline plugin has uniquely enabled continuous delivery for us in a way that\nno competing tool can.\n\n— Neil Hunt of Aquilent\n\nCD Pipelines as Code with\nGithub and Bitbucket\n\nSeptember 15th 4:45 PM - 5:30 PM, Exhibit Hall J\n\nPipeline Multibranch projects come as a natural evolution of pipeline as code:\ndefine your CD pipeline in your source code repository and Jenkins will create\nisolated branch and pull requests jobs for it. This talk is about the\nintegration of the Pipeline Multibranch plugin with Github and Bitbucket as\nbranch sources.\n\n— Antonio Muñiz of CloudBees\n\nRegister for Jenkins World in\nSeptember with the code JWFOSS for a 20% discount off your pass.","title":"Pipeline at Jenkins World 2016","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

But that doesn’t mean it’s done, let alone that it’s\nperfect. While many developers enjoy the power and control that they get from\nwriting Pipelines using scripting, not everyone feels the same way. A lot of\ndevelopers want to specify their build as configuration and get on with building\nsoftware.\n\nPipeline scripts haven’t been a good way to do that…​until now.\n\nWith new changes to Jenkins Pipeline, you are now able to define your Pipeline\nfrom configuration in your Jenkinsfile by installing the new\nPipeline Model Definition\nplugin. It’s available today for you to try via the update center.\nBe sure to check the documentation for examples on how to get started for a\nvariety of languages and platforms.\n\nHere’s a quick example based on the plugin’s own Jenkinsfile :\n\npipeline {\n    // Make sure that the tools we need are installed and on the path.\n    tools {\n        maven \"Maven 3.3.9\"\n        jdk \"Oracle JDK 8u40\"\n    }\n\n    // Run on any executor.\n    agent label:\"\"\n\n    // The order that sections are specified doesn't matter - this will still be run\n    // after the stages, even though it's specified before the stages.\n    postBuild {\n        // No matter what the build status is, run these steps. There are other conditions\n        // available as well, such as \"success\", \"failed\", \"unstable\", and \"changed\".\n        always {\n            archive \"target/**/*\"\n            junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'\n        }\n    }\n\n    stages {\n        // While there's only one stage here, you can specify as many stages as you like!\n        stage(\"build\") {\n            sh 'mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true'\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\nIt’s still early days for this feature, with a lot of further functionality\nplanned to make it easier and more intuitive to define your Pipelines. All of\nthat functionality lives on top of Pipeline scripting, so we’ll also keep\nimproving Pipeline steps and syntax outside of the model! And perhaps most\nexciting, the Pipeline model will be used by an in-the-works visual editor\nthat will be part of the Blue Ocean project - while the editor isn’t ready yet,\nthe Pipeline Model Definition plugin will be bundled with the Blue Ocean beta\nfor you to try out.\n\nI’ll be going into all of this and more at my talk on Thursday, September 15th, at\n3:45pm at Jenkins World, and showing off the same day at the lunchtime demo\ntheater. I can’t wait to see you all there and hear what you think of all this!\n\nAndrew will be\npresenting\nmore of this concept at\nJenkins World in September.\nRegister with the code JWFOSS for 20% off your full conference pass.","title":"Introducing a New Way to Define Jenkins Pipelines","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"abayer","html":"","id":"abayer","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Andrew Bayer","slug":"/blog/authors/abayer","twitter":"abayer"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"029c2b9c-b402-58ba-b094-5060a9fa4c30","slug":"/blog/2016/09/01/jenkins-world-contributor-summit/","strippedHtml":"At previous Jenkins User Conferences we have hosted \"Contributor Summits\" to\ngather developers and power-users in one room to discuss specific areas of\nJenkins, such as Scalability, Pipeline, etc. As part of this year’s\nJenkins World we’re hosting\nanother Contributor\nSummit, to discuss: Blue Ocean ,\nPipeline and Storage Pluggability.\n\nContributors to these three areas of the Jenkins ecosystem will be in\nattendance to present details of their design, requirements, and tentative\nroadmaps.

In\nmany cases when people talk about \"scaling Jenkins\" they’re talking about\n\"Jenkins as a Service\" or \"Continuous Delivery as a Service\" which introduces a\nmuch broader scope, and also more organization-specific requirements, to the\nproblem.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of a big conference like\nJenkins World is getting to\nsee how other people are solving similar problems at different organizations,\nin essence:\n\" how\nthe sausage is made.\" This year’s Jenkins World will be no different, with a number\nof sessions by developers and engineers from the companies leading the way,\nscaling continuous delivery and Jenkins.\n\nRegister for Jenkins World in\nSeptember with the code JWFOSS for a 20% discount off your pass.\n\nIn the realm of \"scaling Jenkins\" the following sessions stand-out to me as\n\"must-attend\" for those interested in the space:\n\nJenkinsOps:\nAn Initiative to Streamline and Automate Jenkins\n\nSeptember 14th 4:15 PM - 5:00 PM, Exhibit Hall A-1\n\nNPR’s Digital Media team uses Jenkins to build, test and deploy code to various\nstaging and production environments. As the complexity of the software\ncomponents, environments and tests have grown - both generally and due to our\nquest to achieve continuous deployment - management of Jenkins has become a\nchallenge. In this talk, we share information about our “JenkinsOps” effort\nwhich has allowed us to automate many of the administrative tasks necessary to\nmanage feature code branches, handle deployments, run tests and configure our\nenvironments properly.\n\n— Paul Miles and Grant Dickie of NPR\n\nThinking\nInside the Container: A Continuous Delivery Story\n\nSeptember 15th 1:30 PM - 2:15 PM, Exhibit Hall C\n\nAt Riot Games, we build a lot of software. Come learn how we built an\nintegrated Docker solution using Jenkins that accepts Docker images submitted\nas build environments by engineers around the company. Our containerized farm\nnow creates over 10,000 containers per week and handles nearly 1,000 jobs at a\nrate of about 100 jobs per hour. All this is done with readily available, open\nsource Jenkins plugins. We’ll explore lessons learned, best practices and how\nto scale and build your own system, as well as why we chose to solve the\nproblem this way…and whether or not we succeeded!\n\n— Maxfield F Stewart of Riot Games\n\nHow\nto Do Continuous Delivery with Jenkins Pipeline, Docker and Kubernetes\n\nSeptember 15th 2:30 PM - 3:15 PM, Great America J\n\nIn this talk, we’ll show how to use Jenkins Pipeline together with Docker and\nKubernetes to implement a complete end-to-end continuous delivery and\ncontinuous improvement system for microservices and monolithic applications\nusing open source software.

But which cluster technology should be used? Docker\nSwarm? Apache Mesos? Kubernetes? How do they compare? All of them can be used\nto dynamically run jobs inside containers. This talk will cover these main\ncontainer clusters, outlining the pros and cons of each, the current state of\nthe art of the technologies and Jenkins support. I believe people will be very\ninterested in learning about the multiple options available.\n\n— Carlos Sanchez of CloudBees\n\nSo,\nYou Want to Build the World’s Biggest Jenkins Cluster?\n\nSeptember 15th 3:45 PM - 4:30 PM, Exhibit Hall C\n\nHow can we do it? We start with some real world results realized by Jenkins\nusers who have built large clusters and review how they got there. Next, we\nwill do experiments scaling some individual sub-components of Jenkins in\nisolation and see what challenges we will face when integrated. The famous\nlarge, distributed systems undoubtedly faced problems scaling - and we can\nlearn from them, too. The result will be recipes for building Jenkins\nclusters with different scaling capabilities. After all of this, you can\nbuild the biggest Jenkins cluster in the world…or maybe just make your own\nJenkins cluster more efficient.\n\n— Stephen Connolly of CloudBees\n\nJenkins at\nSplunk and Splunking Jenkins\n\nSeptember 15th 3:45 PM - 4:30 PM, Exhibit Hall A-1\n\nThis session will highlight how Splunk uses Jenkins to provide an end-to-end\nsolution in the development CI system. Attendees will see how test results are\ndelivered to a Splunk indexer, where they can be analyzed and presented in a\nvariety of ways. This session will also include a live demonstration.\n\n— Bill Houston of Splunk\n\nJenkins inside Google\n\nSeptember 15th 4:45 PM - 5:30 PM, Exhibit Hall C\n\nLast year, we presented our initial investigations and stress testing as we\nprepared to deploy a large-scale Jenkins installation at Google.

As Release Engineer in a company with\nseveral development teams, it comes in handy using several Jenkins instances.\nWhile this approach works fine in our company and gives the developers a lot of\nfreedom, we came across some long-term problems concerning maintenance and\nstandards. These problems were mostly caused by misconfiguration or non-use of\nplugins. With “configuration as code” in mind, I took the approach to apply\nstatic code analysis with the help of SonarQube, a platform to manage code\nquality, for all of our Jenkins job configurations.\n\nAs a small centralized team, we were looking for an easy way to control the\nhealth of our growing Jenkins infrastructure. With considering “configuration\nas code“, I developed a simple extension of SonarQube, to manage the quality\nand usage of all spawned Jenkins instances. The given SonarQube features (like\ncustomized rules/metrics, quality profiles and dashboards) allow us and the\ndevelopment teams to analyze and measure the quality of all created jobs in our\ncompany. Even though Jenkins configuration analysis cannot cover all\nSonarQube’s axes of code quality, I think there is still potential for\nconventions/standards, duplications, complexity, potential bugs\n(misconfiguration) and design and architecture.\n\nThe results of this analysis can be used by all people working with Jenkins. To\nachieve this, I developed a simple extension of SonarQube, containing\neverything which is needed to hook up our SonarQube with our Jenkins\nenvironment. The implementation contains a new basic-language “Jenkins“ and an\ninitial set of rules.\n\nOf course the needs depend strongly on the way Jenkins is being used, so not\nevery rule implemented might be useful for every team, but this applies to all\ntypes of code analysis. The main inspirations for the rules were developer\nfeedback and some articles found in the web. The different ways Jenkins can be\nconfigured provides the potential for many more rules. With this new approach\nof quality analysis, we can enforce best practices like:\n\nPolling must die (Better to triggerb uilds from pushes than poll the\nrepository every x minutes).\n\nUse Log Rotator (Not using log-rotator can result in disk space problems on\nthe controller).\n\nUse agents/labels (Jobs should be defined where to run).\n\nDon’t build on the controller (In larger systems, don’t build on the controller).\n\nEnforce plugin usage (For example: Timestamp, Mask-Passwords).\n\nNaming sanity (Limit project names to a sane (e.g. alphanumeric) character\nset).\n\nAnalyze Groovy Scripts (For example: Prevent System.exit(0) in System Groovy\nScripts).\n\nBesides taking control of all configuration of any Jenkins instance we want,\nthere is also room for additional metrics, like measuring the amount and\ndifferent types of jobs (Freestyle/Maven etc…​) to get an overview about the\ngeneral load of the Jenkins instance. A more sophisticated idea is to measure\ncomplexity of jobs and even pipelines. As code, jobs configuration gets harder\nto understand the more steps are involved. On the one hand scripts, conditions\nand many parameters can negatively influence the readability, especially if you\nhave external dependencies (like scripts) in different locations. On the other\nhand, pipelines can also grow very complex when many jobs are involved and\nchained for execution. It will be very interesting for us to see where and why\ntoo complex pipelines are being created.\n\nOn visualization we rely on the data and its interpretation of SonarQube, which\noffers a big bandwidth of widgets. Everybody can use and customize the\ndashboards. Our centralized team for example has a separate dashboard where we\ncan get a quick overview over all instances.\n\nThe problem of \"growing\" Jenkins with maintenance problems is not new.\nEspecially when you have many developers involved, including with the access to\ncreate jobs and pipelines themselves, an analysis like this SonarQube plugin\nprovides can be useful for anyone who wants to keep their Jenkins in shape.\nCustomization and standards are playing a big role in this scenario. This blog\npost surely is not an advertisement for my developed plugin, it is more about\nthe crazy idea of using static code analysis for Jenkins job configuration. I\nhaven’t seen anything like it so far and I feel that there might be some\npotential behind this idea.\n\nJoin me at my Enforcing Jenkins Best Practices session at the 2016 Jenkins\nWorld to hear more!\n\nDavid will be\npresenting\nmore of this concept at\nJenkins World in September.\nRegister with the code JWFOSS for 20% off your full conference pass.","title":"Enforcing Jenkins Best Practices","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/authors/hinman","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ddf1a677-43d3-5209-a6e7-d331d574df38","slug":"/blog/2016/08/26/ask-the-experts-jenkins-world/","strippedHtml":"Our events officer Alyssa has been working for\nthe past several weeks to organize the \"Open Source Hub\" at\nJenkins World 2016.
