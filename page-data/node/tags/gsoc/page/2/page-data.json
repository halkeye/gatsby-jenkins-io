Thanks a lot to them!\n\n.\n\nThanks a lot to all mentors who were guiding students during their projects:\nZhao Xiaojie,\nKristin Whetstone,\nParichay Barpanda,\nMartin d’Anjou,\nOleg Nenashev,\nAndrey Falko,\nMike Cirioli,\nMark Waite,\nFrancisco Fernandez,\nJustin Harringa,\nOmkar Deshpande,\nUlli Hafner,\nTim Jacomb,\nKara de la Marck,\nJames Strachan,\nNeha Gupta,\nOscar Medina,\nNikhil Da Rocha,\nSahil Kalra,\nBruno P. Kinoshita,\nIoannis Moutsatsos,\nMarky Jackson,\nShivay Lamba, and\nNext Turn.\n\nGSoC 2020 Org admin team:\nKara de la Marck,\nMartin d’Anjou,\nMarky Jackson,\nOleg Nenashev.\n\nEvents\n\nThanks to the GSoC organization stipend from Google and other donations,\nthe Jenkins project usually provides travel grants to successful students so that they can visit a major community event, meet their mentors and community members in person, and present their work there.\nHere are some notes about the GSoC 2019 travel.\nUnfortunately this year it was not possible, and GSoC went completely virtual this year.\n\nOnline meetups\n\nIn August we organized Jenkins Online Meetups where students have presented their projects\n( part 1, part 2).\nYou can find recordings of these presentations in this playlist on the Jenkins YouTube channel.\n\nDevOps World\n\nThis year CloudBees, one of the Jenkins corporate sponsors, invited all students to participate in the DevOps World virtual conference on September 23-25.\nGSoC students did lighting talks about their projects, attended other conference talks, and joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation booth which represented the project at the conference.\nYou can find recordings of the talks and all materials here.\nAlthough the conference was in September, the talks were pre-recorded in early August.\nPlease refer to the Jenkins online meetup recordings for the recent versions.\n\nGSoC Mentor summit\n\nThis is a regular gathering for Google Summer of Code mentors and org admins where they share their experiences about GSoC, outreach programs, community management, and tools.\nUsually it is organized as a multi-day unconference after the end of GSoC, with 2-3 representatives from each project.\nIt has been a great learning experience to participate in it.\nThis year it was a single-day virtual event, and all mentors were able to attend.\nShivay Lamba, one of the GSoC 2020 mentors, also did a lightning talk about the GSoC projects he was working on in Jenkins and CNCF ( slides).\n\nSwag\n\nAll Google Summer of Code students and mentors get swag from Google.\nThis year, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) has sponsored swag for 50 most active GSoC participants:\nall students, mentors, and many other contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.\nThis is the third year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag,\nIn the previous years the swag logistics was one of the most challenging tasks for org admins during the entire project.\nand we highly appreciate help from CDF with this part.\nAs DevOps World presenters, the students have also received special edition speaker swag from CloudBees.\n\nThanks a lot to Google, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) and CloudBees!\n\nRetrospective\n\nAfter completion of the coding phases,\norg admins have reached out to all GSoC 2020 participants to gather their feedback and suggestions.\nWe also recommended that project teams hold their own retrospective meetings.\nSuch information is instrumental to continuously improving GSoC in the Jenkins community.\nWe thank all contributors who shared their feedback!\n\nThe organization-wide retrospective was organized as a survey and a series of retrospective meetings.\nYou can find aggregated results in this Google Doc.\nOverall, we received very positive feedback from students and mentors.\nThe GSoC framework in Jenkins has matured significantly during the previous years.\nThe effort we invested to create guidelines and recommendations for all parties helped a lot because all the expectations were known in advance.\nAs usual, there is much to improve, especially with regards to the community bonding phases and cross-project communications.\nWe are processing the feedback, and we will expand our documentation and the contributor onboarding plans next year.\n\nSome personal notes\n\nI have been involved in leading and coordinating Google Summer of Code in open source projects since 2016.\nThis year I visited the GSoC stand at FOSDEM and met a few organizers and former students.\nA few days after, I proposed participating in GSoC at the Jenkins contributor summit in Brussels,\nand several contributors supported this idea.\nWe spent several hours to create the first Jenkins GSoC page and brainstorm on project ideas.\nWe submitted our application and were accepted.\nThanks a lot to the Google team that gave us a chance!\n\nIt is great to work with the students and see how they explore the open source community and grow professionally as engineers.\nIt is also awesome to see how some of them stay in the project and keep contributing,\nincluding becoming plugin maintainers and GSoC mentors.\nBut, for me, Google Summer of Code is not just about mentoring.\nIt also helps a lot with the community bonding…​ for the existing community like Jenkins which has a lot of isolated sub-communities in plugins.\nMany maintainers work alone, and it can be quite lonely working to maintain a plugin without feedback, developer ideas, and user interactions.\nWhen plugin contributors become project mentors, they join the wider community effort and work in teams.\nIn many cases they start contributing to the organization-wide activities and goals,\nand it grows the \"backbone\" of the Jenkins community.\nLike other community-driven projects, we need such backbone to scale the community and onboard more contributors to the countless Jenkins components.\nSo far it works really well and GSoC excels among outreach programs in this regard.\n\nI would like to thank the Google Open Source team, students and all Jenkins community members for the great Google Summer of Code this year.\nWe also thank the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help to recognize contributors and allow organization administrators to focus on projects.\nLast but not least, I would like to thank the Jenkins org admin team:\nMartin d’Anjou,\nMarky Jackson, and\nKara de la Marck.\nThis was a crazy year for everyone. Regardless of that, the org admins stepped up and took responsibility for students and mentors involved in the project, with a serious time commitment.\nNot all work by the organizers is publicly visible (applications, project selection, resolving conflicts),\nbut this work is essential to the project’s success.\nThanks a lot to org admins and mentors who helped with the administrative tasks this year!\n\nWhat’s about GSoC 2021?\n\nYes, we plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021.\nThe application period for organizations will start in a few months,\nbut we have already started preparing for the next GSoC session.\nWe are looking for mentors, org admins and project ideas.\nPlease contact us if you are interested!\n\nCall for Mentors and Project Ideas\n\nGSoC 2021 project ideas\n\nHOWTO: Propose a project idea\n\nInformation for mentors : guidelines and expectations\n\nWe invite potential students to start exploring the project and the available project ideas.\nOriginal ideas are always welcome in the project, and starting early is a great opportunity to\nget introduced to the Jenkins community, collect more information about the problem areas,\nand to create a good proposal.\n\"Start early\" is the most popular recommendation from GSoC 2020 participants to future GSoC students,\nand we encourage you to follow this advice!","title":"Google Summer

Summer of Code (GSoC)\nis a program where students are paid a stipend by Google to work on a free open source project.\nStudents work on the project for three months (June to August).\nPrior to the coding phase, there is a month of community bonding, to welcome students to the Jenkins community and acquaint them with the projects processes for communication and collaboration.\nMentors are actively involved with students from March when students start to work on and submit their applications.\n(see the timeline)\n\nWe are looking for project ideas and mentors to participate in GSoC 2021.\nGSoC project ideas are coding projects that university or college students can accomplish in about three months.\nThe coding projects can be new features, plugins, test frameworks, infrastructure, etc.\nAnyone can submit a project idea, but of course we like it even better if you offer to mentor your project idea.\n\nWe accept new project ideas at any time,\nHowever, project ideas need to be finalised before February 19th, 2021 at 7pm UTC,\nwhich is the deadline for the Jenkins organization to apply to the GSoC program.\nPlease send us your project ideas before the beginning of February so they can get a proper review by the GSoC committee and by the community.\n\nHow to submit a project idea\n\nCreate a pull-request with your idea in a.adoc file\nin the project ideas.\nIt is not necessary to submit a Google Doc, but it will still work if you want to do that.\nSee the instructions on submitting ideas which include an.adoc template and some examples.\n\nCurrent list of ideas\n\nWe currently have a list of project ideas for students to browse.\nNote that this list is subject to change.\n\nWhat does mentoring involve?\n\nPotential mentors are invited to read the information for mentors.\nNote that being a GSoC mentor does not require expert knowledge of Jenkins.\nMentors do not work alone. We make sure that every project has at least two mentors.\nGSoC org admins will help to find technical advisers, so you can study together with your students.\n\nMentoring takes about 5 to 8 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).\nMentors provide guidance, coaching, and sometimes a bit of cheerleading.\nThey review student proposals, pull-requests and the students presentations\nat the evaluation phase.\nThey fill in the Google provided evaluation report form at the end of coding periods.\n\nWhat do you get in exchange?\n\nIn return of mentoring, a student works on your project full time for three months.\nThink about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but never had the time…​\n\nMentoring is also an opportunity to improve your management and people skills, while giving back to the community.\n\nThere will be a Google Mentor Summit which takes place every year.\nIn 2020, the Mentor Summit was virtual, but in previous years the summit has taken place in person.\n\nSee this post\nabout the 2019 in person Mentor Summit.\n\nGSoC is a fantastic program and the Jenkins project is happy to participate in GSoC again in 2021!\n\nFor any question, you can find the GSoC Org Admins,\nmentors and participants on the GSoC SIG Gitter chat.","title":"Google Summer of Code 2021 call for Project Ideas and Mentors","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2021","community","events","developer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#082848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/0e311/marckk.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/6105b/marckk.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/11755/marckk.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/0e311/marckk.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/b2ade/marckk.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/a4758/marckk.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/47694/marckk.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/bf0f6/marckk.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/213476fc401270f56aae13bbdf67658a/445f6/marckk.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":116.99999999999999}}},"blog":null,"github":"MarckK","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kara works with the open source community at CloudBees.\nShe is co-chair of the Continuous Delivery Foundation’s Interoperability SIG and a mentor and org admin for Outreachy and Google Summer of Code.\nAs a board director of codebar.io, Kara works to increase diversity in the tech industry.\nShe is passionate about making technology accessible and building welcoming tech communities.</p>\n</div>","id":"marckk","irc":null,"linkedin":"karadelamarck","name":"Kara de la Marck","slug":"/blog/author/marckk","twitter":"KaraMarck"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":"43eb825a-3d18-5e4f-a85a-0f03ad89902f","slug":"/blog/2020/08/31/custom-distribution-service/","strippedHtml":"Hello everyone,\n\nThis is the final blog post for the Custom Distribution Service project during the Google Summer of Code timeline.\nI have mixed feelings since we are almost near the finish line for one of the most amazing open source programs out there.\nHowever, it is time to wrap things up for this project and achieve a state where the project can be built upon and extended further.\nThis phase has been super busy with respect to the bug fixes, testing and getting the project hosted, so let us get straight into the phase 3 updates.\n\nFixes and Code quality assurance\n\nSet Jenkinsfile agent to linux\n\nWe realised that the build was failing on windows and that there was not really a use-case\nfor running it on windows for right now. Maybe it could be on a future roadmap. Therefore, we\ndecided to shift the testing to only linux agents with respect to running the tests on the jenkins\nserver.\n\nPull Request #116\n\nBackend port error message\n\nSpring boot has a default message on the port:8080 and therefore we wanted to change\nit to a custom message on the backend. So the major takeaway here is that we needed to\nimplement the Error Controller interface and include a custom message in it.\nThis was technical debt from the last phase and was completed and merged during this phase.\n\nPull Request #92\n\nPMD Analysis\n\nIn order to enhance the quality of the code, the PMD source code analyser was applied to the project.\nIt helped me catch tons of errors. When the initial PMD check was run and we found approximately 162 PMD errors. We realised some of them were not relevant and some of them could be fixed later.\n\nPull Request #102\n\nFindbugs Analysis\n\nAnother tool to improve code quality that we included in this phase was findbugs.\nIt did catch around 5-10 bugs in my code which I immediately resolved. Most of them were\naround the Closeable HTTP Request and an easy fix was the try with resources.\n\nPull Request #118\n\nJacoco Code Coverage\n\nWe needed to make sure most of the code we write had proper coverage for all branches and\nlines. Therefore we decided to include a JaCoco Code Coverage reporter that helped us find the\nuncovered lines and areas we need to improve coverage on.\n\nPull Request #103\n\nRemove JCasC generation\n\nWhile developing the service we quickly realised that the generation of the war package broke if we\nincluded a configuration as code section but did not provide a path to the corresponding required yml\nfile. Therefore we took a decision to remove the casc section all together. Maybe it will comeback in\na future patch\n\nPull Request link: #127\n\nIssue link: #65\n\nMinor Fixes\n\nLogging Fix: #99\n\nDocs Fix : link: #120\n\nUpdate Center Dump Fix : link: #125\n\nClass Path Fix: link: #126\n\nRelease Drafter Addition: link: #136\n\nFront end\n\nCommunity Config Navigation link\n\nThere was no community configuration link present for navigation which was added here.\n Now it is easier to navigate to the community page from the home page itself.\n\nPull Request #100\n\nDocker updates\n\nBuild everything with Docker\n\nThis was one of the major changes this phase with respect to making the service very easy to spin up locally, this change will greatly help community adoption since it eliminates the tools one needs to install locally. Initially the process was to run maven locally, generate all of the files and then copy all of its contents into the container. However, with this change we are going to generate all of the files inside the docker container itself. Allowing the user to just run a couple of commands to get the service up and running.\n\nSo some of the major changes we did with respect to the dockerfile was:\n\na) Copy all of the configuration files and pom.xml into the container.\n\nb) Run the command mvn clean package inside the container which generates the jar.\n\nc) Run the jar inside the container.\n\nPull Request #104\n\nHosting updates\n\nThis process was supposed to be a future roadmap, however the infra team approved and was super helpful\nin making this process as smooth as possible. Thanks to Gavin, Tim and Oblak for making this possible.\nHere is the google group dicussion\n\nThe project has now been hosted here as a preview. It still needs\nsome fixes to be fully functional.\n\nInfra Docker PR #131\n\nInfra Project Addition PR link: #393\n\nTesting Updates\n\nUnit test the services\n\nWith respect to community hosting and adoption, testing of the service one of the most important and major milestones for this phase was to test the majority of the code and we have completed the testing with flying colors. All of the services have been completely unit tested, which is a major accomplishment.\nFor the testing of the service we decided to go with wiremock which can be used to mock external services. Kezhi’s comment helped us to understand what we needed to do since he had done something quite similar in his Github Checks API project.\n\nSo we basically wiremocked the update-center url and made sure we were getting\nthe accurate response with appropriate control flow logic tested.\n\nwireMockRule.stubFor(get(urlPathMatching(\"/getUpdateCenter\"))\n                .willReturn(aResponse()\n                        .withStatus(200)\n                        .withHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n                        .withBody(updateCenterBody)));\n\nPull Request #105\n\nAdd Update Center controller tests\n\nAnother major testing change involved testing the controllers. For this we decided to use the wiremock library in java to mock the server response when the controllers were invoked.\n\nFor example: If I have a controller that serves in an api called /api/plugin/getPluginList\nwiremock can be used to stub out its response when the system is under test. So we use something like this to test it out.\n\nwhen(updateService.downloadUpdateCenterJSON()).thenReturn(util.convertPayloadToJSON(dummyUpdateBody))\n\nWhen the particular controller is called the underlying service is mocked and it returns a response according to the one provided by us. To find more details the PR is here.\n\nPull Request #106\n\nAdd Packager Controller Tests\n\nAlong with the update center controller tests another controller that needed to be tested was the\npackager controller. Also we needed to make sure that all the branches for the controllers were properly tested. Additional details can be found in the PR below.\n\nPull Request #133\n\nDocker Compose Tests\n\nOne problem that we faced the entire phase was the docker containers. We regularly found out that due to\nsome changes in the codebase the docker container build sometimes broke, or even sometimes the inner api’s seemed to malfunction. In order to counteract that we decided to come up with some tests locally.\nSo what I did was basically introduce a set of bash scripts that would do the following:\n\na) Build the container using the docker-compose command.\n\nb) Run the container.\n\nc) Test the api’s using the exposed port.\n\nd) Teardown the running containers.\n\nPull Request #131\n\nUser Documentation\n\nWe also included a user docs guide so that it makes it super easy to get started with the service.\n\nPull Request #145\n\nFuture Roadmap\n\nThis has been a super exciting project to work on and I can definitely see this project being built\nupon and extended in the future.\n\nI would like to talk about some of the features that are left to come in and can be taken up in\na future roadmap discussion\n\na) JCasC Support :\n\nDescription: Support the generation of a Jenkins Configuration as Code file asking the user interactively for the plugins they select what would be the configuration they would want eg: If the user selects the slack plugin we need to ask him questions like what is the slack channel? what is the token? etc, and on the basis of this generate a casc file. This feature was initially planned to go into the service but we realised this is a project in its own capacity.\n\nb) Auto Pull Request Creation :\n\nDescription: Allow users to create a configuration file and immediately open a pull request on github\nwithout leaving the user interface. This was originally planned using a github bot and we started the work on it. But we were in doubt if the service would be hosted or not and therefore put the development on hold.\nYou can find the pull requests here:\n\nGithub Controller #72\n\nPull Request Creation Functions #66\n\nc) Synergy with Image Controller\n\nDescription: This feature requires some planning, some of the questions we can ask are:\n\na) Can we generate the images (i.e Image Controller).\nb) Can we have the service as a multipurpose generator ?\n\nStatistics\n\nThis phase has been the busiest of all phases and it has involved a lot of work, more than I had\ninitially expected in the phase.

When a build failed (which leads to a failed check), a Re-run button will be added automatically by GitHub.\n\nBy clicking the Re-run button, Jenkins will reschedule a build for the last commit of this branch.\n\nSince all checks of a commit are produced by a single build, you don’t have to rerun all failed checks, just rerun any one of the failed check will refresh all checks.\n\nGit SCM Support\n\nThanks to Ullrich 's great help, the GitHub Checks Plugin now supports Git SCM.\nThis means now you can publish checks for your freestyle project or any other projects that use Git SCM.\n\nDocument\n\nConsumers Guide and Implementation Guide are now available.\nAs a Jenkins developer, you can now start consuming our API or even providing an implementation for other SCM platforms beside GitHub.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThe whole GitHub Checks API project is started as a Google Summer of Code project. Much appreciate my mentors ( Tim and Ullrich) for their great help during the whole summer. Also huge thanks to the Jenkins GSoC SIG and the whole community for the technique support and resources.\n\nResources\n\nChecks API Plugin\n\nGitHub Checks Plugin\n\nProject Page\n\nGitter Channel","title":"GitHub Checks API Plugin Project - Coding Phase 3","tags":["github","api","plugins","developer","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/19e71/XiongKezhi.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/77b35/XiongKezhi.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/d4a57/XiongKezhi.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/19e71/XiongKezhi.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/68974/XiongKezhi.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/ef6ff/XiongKezhi.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/8257c/XiongKezhi.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/6766a/XiongKezhi.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/bedf23c1062bf01bb5bdcdd5aea7730e/22bfc/XiongKezhi.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"XiongKezhi","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2020 Student.

If you’d like to skip the journey part, you can directly go to the [major performance improvements] section and the [minor performance section] to see what we’ve done!\n\nJourney to release\n\nThe project started with deciding to choose a git operation and then trying to compare the performance of that operation by using command line git and then with JGit.\n\nStage 1: Benchmark results with git fetch\n\nThe performance of git fetch (average execution time/op) is strongly correlated to the size of a repository\n\nThere exists an inflection point on the scale of repository size after which the nature of JGit performance changes (it starts to degrade)\n\nAfter running multiple benchmarks, it is safe to say that for a large sized repository command line git would be a better choice of implementation.\n\nWe can use this insight to implement a feature which avoids JGit with large repositories.\n\nStage 2: Comparing platforms\n\nThe project was also concerned that there might be important differences between operating systems.\nFor example, what if command line Git for Windows performed very differently than command line Git on Linux or FreeBSD?\nBenchmarks were run to compare fetch performance on several platforms.\n\nRunning git fetch operation for a 400 MiB sized repository on:\n\nAMD64 Microsoft Winders\n\nAMD64 FreeBSD\n\nIBM PowerPC 64 LE Ubuntu 18\n\nIBM System 390 Ubuntu 18\n\nThe result of running this experiment is given below:\n\nThe difference in performance between git and JGit remains constant across all platforms.\n\nBenchmark results on one platform are applicable to all platforms.\n\nStage 3: Performance of git fetch and repository structure\n\nThe area of the circle enclosing each parameter signifies the strength of the positive correlation between the performance of a git fetch operation and that parameter. From the diagram:\n\nSize of the aggregated objects is the dominant player in determining the execution time for a git fetch\n\nNumber of branches and Number of tags play a similar role but are strongly overshadowed by size of repository\n\nNumber of commits has a negligible effect on the performance of running git fetch\n\nAfter running these experiments from Stage-1 to Stage-3, we developed a solution called the GitToolChooser which is explained in the next stage\n\nStage 4: Faster checkout with Git tool chooser\n\nThis feature takes the responsibility of choosing the optimal implementation from the user and hands it to the plugin. It takes the decision of recommending an implementation on the basis of the size of the repository. Here is how it works.\n\nThe image above depicts the performance enhancements we have performed over the course of the GSoC project. These improvements have enabled the checkout step to be finished within half of what it used to take earlier in some cases.\n\nLet’s talk about performance improvements in two parts.\n\nMajor performance improvements\n\nBuilding Tensorflow (~800 MiB) using a Jenkins pipeline, there is over 50% reduction in overall time spent in completing a job!\nThe result is consistent multiple platforms.\n\nThe reason for such a decrease is the fact that JGit degrades in performance when we are talking about large sized repositories. Since the GitToolChooser is aware of this fact, it chooses to recommend command line git instead which saves the user some time.\n\nMinor performance improvements\n\nNote: Enable JGit before using the new performance features to let GitToolChooser work with more options → Here’s how\n\nBuilding the git plugin (~ 20 MiB) using a Jenkins pipeline, there is a drop of a second across all platforms when performance enhancement is enabled. Also, eliminating a redundant fetch reduces unnecessary load on git servers.\n\nThe reason for this change is the fact that JGit performs better than command line git for small sized repositories (<50MiB) as an already warmed up JVM favors the native Java implementation.\n\nReleases\n\nGit Plugin 4.4.0\n\nAdd GitToolChooser\n\nRemove redundant fetch\n\nGit Client Plugin 3.4.0\n\nAdd support to communicate compatibility of JGit with certain additional SCM behaviors\n\nThe road ahead\n\nSupport from other branch source plugins\n\nPlugins like the GitHub Branch Source Plugin or GitLab Branch Source Plugin need to extend an extension point provided by the git plugin to facilitate the exchange of information related to size of a remote repository hosted by the particular git provider\n\nJENKINS-63519 : GitToolChooser predicts the wrong implementation\n\nAddition of this feature to GitSCMSource\n\nDetection of lock related delays accessing the cache directories present on the controller\n\nThis issue was reported by the plugin maintainer Mark Waite, there is a need to reproduce the issue first and then find a possible solution.\n\nReaching out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions or feedback on the project’s\nGitter Channel or the\nJenkins Developer Mailing list.\nReport an issue at Jenkins Jira.\n\nUseful Links\n\nPhase 1 Blog: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/07/09/git-performance-improvement-phase1/\n\nPhase 2 Blog: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/07/29/git-performance-improvement-phase2/\n\nProject Page: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/git-plugin-performance/\n\nDemonstration","title":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement: Final Phase and Release","tags":["plugins","git","platform-sig","developer","performance","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#685848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/77b35/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/d4a57/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/68974/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/ef6ff/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/8257c/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/6766a/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/22bfc/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"rishabhBudhouliya","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2020 student under the Jenkins project (Git Plugin Performance Improvements).\nAspiring to be better at Software Development and participate more in the open source\ncommunity.</p>\n</div>","id":"rishabhbudhouliya","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rishabh Budhouliya","slug":"/blog/author/rishabhbudhouliya","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":"c3c50d8e-f813-526e-9f03-e29284122a65","slug":"/blog/2020/08/27/machine-learning-plugin-coding-phase3/","strippedHtml":"Good to see you all again !\n\nThis is my final blog post about coding phase 3 in Jenkins Machine Learning Plugin for GSoC 2020.\nBeing at the end of GSoC 2020, we had to finish all the pending issues and testing before a stable release in the main repository. Throughout this program, there were lots of learning and hard work will make this plugin valuable to the Data Science and Jenkins community.\n\nSummary\n\nWith combining all of the work in phase 1, 2 and 3, initial version of Machine learning plugin( 1.0 ) was successfully released in Jenkins plugin repository.\nAn interesting feature which allows users to connect to their existing programming language kernels more than connecting to only IPython kernel was introduced in this phase. It can be selected in multiple steps with different kernel.\nImages and graphs produced by Jupyter notebooks will be saved in user preferred folder in the workspace that can be used for reporting/analytic purposes later. Hoping this blog summarizes the Machine Learning’s features and future contributions. Thank you for your interest and support !!!\n\nMain features of Machine Learning plugin\n\nExecute Jupyter notebooks directly\n\nRun different language scripts using multiple build steps\n\nConvert Jupyter Notebooks to Python\n\nConfigure Jupyter kernels( IPython, IRKernel, IJulia etc) properties\n\nSupport to execute Notebooks/scripts on Agent\n\nExtract graph/map/images from the code\n\nEach build step can be associated with a machine learning task\n\nSupport for Windows and Linux\n\nFuture improvements\n\nImproving performance of the plugin\n\nTry to implement jira:JENKINS-63377[]\n\nSupport parameterized definitions in Notebooks jira:JENKINS-63478[]\n\nIncreasing testing code coverage\n\nMultiple language kernel support\n\nIf there are existing kernels in the system, user will be able to configure in the global configurations in order to apply in the builder/step configuration.\n\nSome popular interactive kernels\n\nIPython for python\n\nIRKernel for R\n\nIJulia for Julia\n\nIJavascript for javascript\n\nMore kernels and installation guides are found here. https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels\n\nDump images and graphs\n\nText output will be displayed in the console log. At the same time images/graphs/heat maps and HTMLs will be saved in the workspace. An action is shown in the left panel to display images in realtime. Due to the Content Security Policy of jenkins, some HTMLs which contain harmful javascript may not render in jenkins UI.\n\nFixed bugs\n\nThere were more bugs identified and fixed with many interactive testings. Setting the working directory of kernels was a big issue while getting datasets/files by script. Zeppelin process launcher was bypassed to fix this issue.\n\nPatch version released\n\nA major bug which was created while setting the process working directory had patched in the v1.0.1. The latest release is more stable now.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nMachine Learning plugin had been developed under GSoC 2020 program. A huge thanks to Bruno P. Kinoshita, Marky Jackson, Shivay Lamba, Ioannis Moutsatsos and Org admins for this wonderful experience.\nI would be grateful for contributing this plugin continuously and more in Jenkins.\n\nResources\n\nCommunity Bonding blog post\n\nPhase 1 blog post\n\nPhase 2 blog post\n\nGithub\n\nProject page\n\nPlugin page\n\nDesign document","title":"Machine Learning Plugin project - Coding Phase 3 blog post","tags":["machinelearning","datascience","jupyter","plugins","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/9b030/loghijiaha.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/f38b5/loghijiaha.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/bcd2b/loghijiaha.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/ceea6/loghijiaha.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/45b82/loghijiaha.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/933cd/loghijiaha.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/6c13d/loghijiaha.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":158}}},"blog":null,"github":"loghijiaha","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Computer Science and Engineering Student at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

Please note that the database\nwill not be created by the plugin, the user has to create the database.\n\nConnection Timeout - Set the connection timeout duration in seconds.\n\nSocket Timeout - Set the socket timeout duration in seconds.\n\nCredentials - Configure authentication using username and password to the PostgreSQL instance.\n\nUse the Test PostgreSQL Connection button to verify that the details are correct and Jenkins is able to connect to\nthe PostgreSQL instance.\n\n[IMPORTANT] When configuring the plugin for the first time, it is highly important to press the Perform PostgreSQL\nSchema Initialization button. It will automatically perform schema initialization and create the necessary indexes.\nThe button can also be used in the case the database is wiped out and schema needs to be recreated.\n\nPress the Save button.\n\nNow, all the fingerprints produced by this Jenkins instance should be saved in the configured PostgreSQL instance!\n\nQuerying the Fingerprint Database\n\nDue to the relational structure defined by PostgreSQL, it allows users/developers to query the fingerprint data which\nwas not possible using the Redis fingerprint storage plugin.\n\nThe fingerprint storage can act as a consolidated storage for multiple Jenkins instances.\nFor example, to search for a fingerprint id across Jenkins instances using the file name, the following query could be\nused:\n\nSELECT fingerprint_id FROM fingerprint.fingerprint\nWHERE filename = 'random_file';\n\nA sample query is provided which can be tweaked depending on the parameters to be searched:\n\nSELECT * FROM fingerprint.fingerprint\nWHERE fingerprint_id = 'random_id'\n        AND instance_id = 'random_jenkins_instance_id'\n        AND filename = 'random_file'\n        AND original_job_name = 'random_job'\n        AND original_job_build_number = 'random_build_number'\n        AND timestamp BETWEEN '2019-12-01 23:59:59'::timestamp AND now()::timestamp\n\nThe facets are stored in the database as jsonb.\nPostgreSQL offers support to query jsonb.\nThis is especially useful for querying the information stored inside fingerprint facets.\nAs an example, the Docker Traceability Plugin stores information like the name of Docker images inside these\nfacets.\nThese can be queried across Jenkins instances like so:\n\n>'imageName' = 'random_container';\n\nAt the moment these queries require working knowledge of the database.\nIn future, these queries can be abstracted away by plugins and the features made available to users directly inside\nJenkins.\n\nDemo\n\nExternal Fingerprint Storage Demo\n\nSlide deck\n\nReleases 🚀\n\nWe released the 0.1-alpha-1 version for the\nPostgreSQL Fingerprint Storage Plugin.\nPlease refer to the\n\nchangelog for more information.\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin 1.0-rc-3 was also\nreleased.\nThe\n\nchangelog provides more details.\n\nA few API changes made in the Jenkins core were released in Jenkins-2.253.\nIt mainly includes exposing fingerprint range set serialization methods for plugins.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nThe relational structure of the plugin allows some performance improvements that can be made when implementing\ncleanup, as well as improving the performance of Fingerprint#add(String job, int buildNumber).\nThese designs were discussed and are a scope of future improvement.\n\nThe current external fingerprint storage API supports configuring multiple Jenkins instances to a single storage.\nThis opens up the possibility of developing traceability plugins which can track fingerprints across Jenkins instances.\n\nPlease consider reaching out to us if you feel any of the use cases would benefit you, or if you would like to share\nsome new use cases.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe
