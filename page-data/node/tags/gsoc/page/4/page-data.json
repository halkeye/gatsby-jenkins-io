I am participating in GSoC 2020 with Jenkins.\nI am working on the Windows Service Wrapper Project.\nSo the Coding Phase 01 of GSoC 2020 is now over and this blog post describes what I have done so far.\n\nWindows Service Wrapper is an executable, which we can use to run applications as Windows Services on Windows machines, which has almost one million downloads.\nIn Jenkins, we use Windows service wrapper to run Jenkins server and agents as Windows services to gain more robustness.\nThis feature is bundled into Jenkins’s core. Currently, the Windows Service wrapper is configured by an XML file.\nHowever, there is a limited number of configuration checks and there is no XML schema.\n\nXML is not such a human-friendly way to do that. It is quite verbose and not easy to identify the schema without some effort.\nUsually, users misconfigure the service wrapper. This is a sample XML configuration file that we can use to provide configurations to Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nSample XML Configuration File\n\njenkins\nJenkins\nThis service runs Jenkins automation server.\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_201\\bin\\java.exe\n-Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle\n    -jar \"C:\\Program Files\\Jenkins\\jenkins.war\" --httpPort=8081 --webroot=\"%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinswar\"\nrotate\n\n%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinsjenkins.pid\n10000\nfalse\n\nThe usage of YAML could simplify configuration management in Jenkins, especially when automated and configuration management tools are used.\nSo what we are doing under GSoC - 2020 is to update the Windows Service Wrapper to support YAML configurations.\nAfter finishing this project, users will be able to provide configurations to the Windows Service Wrapper as a YAML file.\n\nThis is a sample YAML configuration file for Windows Service Wrapper and you can see it is less verbose than XML or JSON and much more human friendly.\nUsers can read and edit this without a big effort.\n\nSample YAML Configuration File\n\nid: jenkins\nname: Jenkins\ndescription: This service runs Jenkins automation server.\nenv:\n    _name: JENKINS_HOME\n    _value: '%LocalAppData%\\Jenkins.jenkins'\nexecutable: 'C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_201\\bin\\java.exe'\narguments: >-\n    -Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle\n    -jar \"C:\\Program Files\\Jenkins\\jenkins.war\" --httpPort=8081 --webroot=\"%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinswar\"\nlogmode: rotate\nonfailure:\n    _action: restart\nextensions:\n    -\n        pidfile: '%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinsjenkins.pid'\n        stopTimeout: '10000'\n        stopParentFirst: 'false'\n        _enabled: 'true'\n        _className: winsw.Plugins.RunawayProcessKiller.RunawayProcessKillerExtension\n        _id: killOnStartup\n\nAdvantages of YAML as a configuration file\n\nIt is less verbose and much more human friendly than XML.\n\nSince YAML is not using extra delimiters, it is lightweight.\n\nNowadays YAML has become more popular among configuration management tools.\n\nProject Scope\n\nDuring this project, I will add the following features to Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nYAML Configuration support\n\nYAML Schema validation\n\nNew CLI for the Windows Service Wrapper\n\nSupport for XML Schema validation via XML Schema Definition (XSD)\n\nPhase 01 Updates\n\nIn GSoC - 2020 phase 01, I have done the following updates to the Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nProject Structure overview document. (Published)\n\nYAML configurations support (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nNew CLI (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nXML Schema validation (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nYou can find Phase 01 Demo slides in this link.\n\nBelow you can find more details about the deliverables listed above.\n\nProject Structure overview\n\nThe project structure overview document describes how files and directories are organized in the Windows Service Wrapper project.\nIt will help contributors as well as users, to understand the codebase easily.\nAlso, it helps me a lot to understand the codebase. You can find the document from the given link.\n\nYAML configurations support\n\nAs I explained before, in this project, configurations will be provided as a YAML file.\nI used YamlDotNet library which has more than 2.2k stars on GitHub, to deserialize the YAML file into an Object graph.\nIn this YAML file, users can specify configurations in a more structured way than in XML configuration files.\nAs an example, now users can specify all the log related configurations under the log config.\nUsers can specify all service account related configurations under serviceaccount config etc.\n\nAt the moment, I am working on a design document for YAML configuration support. I will add it to the GitHub Issue once ready\n\nNew CLI\n\nBefore moving into Phase 01 updates, it’s better to explain why we needed a new CLI for Windows Service Wrapper.\nIn the early phases of Windows Service Wrapper, we will keep the XML configuration support as well.\nSo we should allow users to specify the configurations file separately.\nThe current approach is, configurations file should be in the same directory, where Windows Service Wrapper executable exists and the file name of the XML file should be the same as the Windows Service Wrapper executable file name.\nAlso, users should be able to redirect logs if they need to and they should be allowed to elevate command prompt using Windows Service Wrapper.\nAlso, we thought that it’s better to allow users to skip schema validation if they needed. So we decided to move into a new CLI.\n\nAs I explained, after releasing this, users will have options in addition to commands.\nIt will make the WinSW CLI more flexible so that we can easily extend it later. These are the options users are allowed to use.\nThese options are available with all the commands except help and version\n\n--redirect / -r [string]\n\nUsers can specify the redirect path for the logs if needed\n\nNot required | Default value is null\n\n--elevated / -e [boolean]\n\nElevate the command prompt before executing the command\n\nNot required | Default value is false\n\n--configFile / -c [string]\n\nUsers can specify the configurations file as a path\n\nNot Required | Default value is null\n\n--skipConfigValidation / -s [boolean]\n\nUsers can skip schema validation for configurations file if needed\n\nNot required | Default value is true\n\n--help / -h\n\nUser can find what options are available with a particular command with this option\n\nThis option is available with the install command\n\n--profile / -f [boolean]\n\nIf this option is true, then users can provide a service account for installation explicitly.\n\nNot required | Default value is false\n\nWe used commandlineparser/commandline library to parse the command line argument which has more than 2k stars in GitHub. At a glance, the library is compatible with .NET Framework 4.0+, Mono 2.1+ Profile, .NET Standard, and .NET Core.\n\nXML Schema validation\n\nAs I mentioned before, there was no schema validation for XML in Windows Service Wrapper.\nHence, I was working on schema validation for XML. I use XSD to validate XML files. The XSD file will be shipped as an embedded resource with the executable.\nYou can find the XSD file in my pull request.\n\nFuture updates\n\nIn the next phase, for GSoC 2020 the listed deliverables features will be released and the YAML schema validation feature will be added.\nAlso, we hope to publish a design document for the new features, which will help contributors.\n\nHow to contribute\n\nYou can find the GitHub repository in this link. Issues and Pull requests are always welcome.\nAlso, you can communicate with us in the WinSW Gitter channel, which is a great way to get in touch and there are project sync up meetings every Tuesday at 13:30 UTC on the Gitter channel.\n\nSome useful links\n\nProject Page\n\nProject Repository\n\nGitter Channel\n\nYamlDotNet library\n\nCommand Line Parser library","title":"Windows Service Wrapper : YAML Configuration Support - GSoC Phase - 01 Updates","tags":["winsw","windows","jenkins","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"buddhikac96","html":"","id":"buddhikac96","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Buddhika Chathuranga","slug":"/blog/author/buddhikac96","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9a5f343b-e83f-526e-aab4-05c8c88ea996","slug":"/blog/2020/06/30/machine-learning-plugin-coding-phase1/","strippedHtml":"Welcome back !\n\nThis blog post is briefing my coding phase 1 in Jenkins Machine Learning Plugin for this GSoC 2020.\n\nAfter a fresh introduction of community bonding, On June 1st, coding of GSoC had started officially with phase 1. At this point, every GSoC student should be expected to have a rigid plan with their entire project. With the guidance of mentors I was able to complete a design document and timeline which can be slightly adjustable during the coding. The coding phase was more about coding and discussion.\n\nQuick review\n\nPull Requests\n21\n\nJira Issues\n11\n\nMajor Tasks\n3\n\nCompleted\n3\n\nIn progress\n0\n\nWeek 1\n\nI have to ensure that I have a solid architecture for implementing the core of this plugin such that perhaps I or future community will be able to develop R and Julia kernels for this plugin. Factory method design patterns are suitable when users need different types of products ( Python, R and Julia) without knowing much about the internal infrastructure ( Manager of these interpreters ).\n\nAll the base classes were implemented this week.\n\nDesign the Kernel connectors\n\nInitiate the interpreter\n\nClose the connection\n\nAdd simple tests\n\nUpdate pom.xml\n\nMore than these changes, repo was updated with pull request template and licence header. Readme was extended a little at the end of the week.\n\nIssues and Challenges\n\nGit rebase and squash\n\nTests invokes ipython client in the server failed during the CI build\n\nWeek 2\n\nWith the help of a design document, I had a plan to do the configurations globally and using the Abstract Folder property I could save the configuration and retrieve for the job configuartion. I used to reference some other well developed plugin for the structure of code. That helped me a lot while I was coding. Our first official contributor has popped out his pull request.\n\nForm validations and helper html will be a great help in the user point of view as well as developers. A minor bug was fixed with the guidance of mentors by writing tests with ‘Jenkins WebClient`. Until the end of the week, builder class of the plugin has been implemented with lots of research and discussion. Finally,  Test connection was added to the global configuration page to start the connection and test it. A single issue that blocked me using py4j authentication about zeppelin-python was reported in Jira.\n\nServer Configuration\n\nIssues and challenges\n\nBackend depends on Apache zeppelin-python API to connect IPython\n\nFind relevant extension points to extend the plugin\n\nWeek 3\n\nEarlier in this week, we were trying to merge our IPython builder PR without any memory leaks or bugs that will cause the system to be devastating while running this plugin. Later, this whole week I was implementing a file parser that could copy the necessary files and had the ability to accomplish the file conversion.\n\nSupported file types\n\nPython (.py)\n\nJSON (Zeppelin notebooks format)\n\nIPython builder was able to run Jupyter Notebooks and Zeppelin formatted JSON files at the end of the 3rd week. Minor issues were fixed in the code. We used ANSI color plugin to fix the abnormal view of error messages produced by the ipython kernel.\n\nCopying and converting Jupyter Notebook\n\nIssues and Challenges\n\nPython error messages could not be displayed in rich format\nIf a job is running at user level, but if the python code access file/file path which is not authorized to the user, it returns a permission denied message.\nWhile running on agent, notebook has to be written/copied to agent workspace\nArtifacts should be maintained/reachable from controller after build.\n\nWeek 4\n\nAs all the major tasks has done, the demo preparation and plan for a experimental release was carried during the last week. There were lots of research on how to connect to a existing kernel in remote. Demo and presentation were prepared along the week.\n\nIssues and Challenges\n\nReleasing the first version was bit late\n\nKnowledge transfer\n\nHow to debug the code through IntelliJ\n\nEdit configuration → Add new Configuration → Maven\n\nCommand line → type hpi:run\n\nClick the debug icon on the toolbar or go to Run menu then Debug\n\nHow to setup to test the plugin\n\nSetup JDK 8 and Maven 3.5.*\n\nCreate a directory $ mkdir machine-learning-plugin\n\nCreate a virtual environment $ virtualenv venv\n\nActivate your virtual environment $ source venv/bin/activate\n\nRun $ which python to ensure your python path\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/machine-learning-plugin.git\n\nRun $ mvn clean install from the machine-learning-plugin directory\n\nRun $ mvn hpi:run to start Jenkins with the plugin\n\nSet up the builder with localhost and other parameters\n\nCreate a job\n\nWrite python code like print(“plugin works”)\n\nBuild the job\n\nIssues and bugs\n\nJENKINS-62528 Issues on Jenkins build in the plugin repository\n\nJENKINS-62621 Global configuration for IPython servers\n\nJENKINS-62649 Implementation of IPython Builder\n\nJENKINS-62711 File parser to copy source files to workspace\n\nJENKINS-62733 Python errors are not displayed properly in console log\n\nJENKINS-62735 Send/Receive necessary files from controller/agent to agent/controller\n\nJENKINS-62593 Improve the documentation\n\nJENKINS-62742 Increase Test coverage\n\nResources and Links\n\nGithub\n\nProject page\n\nDesign document","title":"Machine Learning Plugin project - coding phase 1 blog post","tags":["machinelearning","datascience","plugins","communitybonding","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/9b030/loghijiaha.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/f38b5/loghijiaha.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/bcd2b/loghijiaha.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/ceea6/loghijiaha.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/45b82/loghijiaha.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/933cd/loghijiaha.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/6c13d/loghijiaha.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":158}}},"blog":null,"github":"loghijiaha","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Computer Science and Engineering Student at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

The fingerprint engine of Jenkins can track usages of artifacts, credentials, files, etc. within the system. Currently, it does this by maintaining a local XML-based database which leads to dependence on the physical disk of the Jenkins controller.\n\nAllowing fingerprint storage to be moved to external storages decreases the dependence of Jenkins instances on the physical disk space and also allows for tracking the flow of fingerprints across instances of Jenkins connected to the same external storage.\n\nAdvantages of using external storage drivers:\n\nRemove dependence on Jenkins controller disk storage\n\nCan configure pay-as-you-use cloud storages\n\nEasy Backup Management\n\nBetter Reliability and Availability\n\nFingerprints can be tracked across Jenkins instances\n\nAlong with this API, we are also working on a reference implementation in the form of a plugin, powered by Redis.\n\nAs phase 1 of this project comes to an end, this blog post serves as a summary of the progress we made to the entire Jenkins community.\n\nCurrent State\n\nThe new API introduced in Jenkins core is under review. Once merged, it will offer developers to extend it to build external fingerprint storage plugins.\n\nThe Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin is alpha release ready. We would immensely appreciate any feedback.\n\nExternal Fingerprint Storage Demo\n\nIntroducing the new API for plugin developers\n\nWith PR-4731, we introduce a new fingerprint storage API, allowing configuring custom storage engines.\nWe exposed the following methods in the new FingerprintStorage class:\n\nvoid save()\n\nSaves the given Fingerprint in the storage.\n\nFingerprint load(String id)\n\nReturns the Fingerprint with the given unique ID. The unique ID for a fingerprint is defined by Fingerprint#getHashString().\n\nvoid delete(String id)\n\nDeletes the Fingerprint with the given unique ID.\n\nboolean isReady()\n\nReturns true if there is some data in the fingerprint database corresponding to the particular Jenkins instance.\n\nIntroducing Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin uses the new External Fingerprint Storage API to store the fingerprints in a Redis instance.\n\nInstallation:\n\nThe alpha release (version 0.1-alpha-1) for the plugin was drafted, and can be installed using the experimental update center.\n\nFollow along the following steps after running Jenkins to download and install the plugin:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Manage Plugins\n\nGo to Advanced tab\n\nConfigure the Update Site URL as: https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/update-center.json\n\nClick on Submit, and then press the Check Now button.\n\nGo to Available tab.\n\nSearch for Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin and check the box along it.\n\nClick on Install without restart\n\nThe plugin should now be installed on your system.\n\nUsage\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, you can configure the Redis server details by following the steps below:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Configure System\n\nScroll to the section Redis Fingerprint Storage Configuration and fill in the required details:\n\nHost - Enter hostname where Redis is running\n\nPort - Specify the port on which Redis is running\n\nSSL - Click if SSL is enabled\n\nDatabase - Redis supports integer indexed databases, which can be specified here.\n\nConnection Timeout - Set the connection timeout duration in milliseconds.\n\nSocked Timeout - Set the socket timeout duration in milliseconds.\n\nCredentials - Configure authentication using username and password to the Redis instance.\n\nEnabled - Check this to enable the plugin (Note: This is likely to be removed very soon, and will be enabled by default.)\n\nUse the Test Redis Connection to verify that the details are correct and Jenkins is able to connect to the Redis instance.\n\nPress the Save button.\n\nNow, all the fingerprints produced by this Jenkins instance should be saved in the configured Redis server!\n\nFuture Work\n\nSome of the topics we aim to tackle in the next phases include extending the API, fingerprint cleanup, migrations (internal→external, external→internal, external→external), tracing, ORM, implementing the saveable listener, etc.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe Redis Fingerprint Storage plugin is built and maintained by the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Team for\nExternal Fingerprint Storage for Jenkins.\n\nSpecial thanks to Oleg Nenashev, Andrey Falko, Mike Cirioli, Jesse Glick, and the entire Jenkins community for all the contribution to this project.\n\nReaching Out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions, feedback, etc. on the project’s Gitter Channel or the Jenkins Developer Mailing list\n\nWe use Jenkins Jira to track issues.\nFeel free to file issues under redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin component.\n\nOther Links\n\nPhase 1 demo\n\nPresentation slides\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nIssue Tracker for Phase 1\n\njep:226[]\n\nGitter Channel\n\nProject Page","title":"External Fingerprint Storage Phase-1 Updates","tags":["plugins","fingerprint","cloud-native","external-storage","developer","redis","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/19e71/stellargo.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/77b35/stellargo.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/d4a57/stellargo.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/19e71/stellargo.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/ef6ff/stellargo.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/8257c/stellargo.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/6766a/stellargo.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://medium.com/@sumitsarinofficial","github":"stellargo","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2020 student.

We are working this new Machine Learning Plugin for this GSoC 2020.\nThis is my story about the community bonding of GSoC 2020. I am happy to share my journey with you.\n\nIntroducing Myself and my Fantastic 4 Mentors\n\nI am Loghi Perinpanayagam from University of Moratuwa. I was selected for GSoC 2020 for Machine Learning Plugin in Jenkins. I am glad to introduce my mentors to this project. I was assigned with four mentors who are really enthusiastic to help me on kicking off this summer of code.\n\nStudent\n\nLoghi Perinpanayagam\n\nMentors\n\nBruno P. Kinoshita\n\nIoannis Moutsatsos\n\nMarky Jackson\n\nShivay Lamba\n\nHow was my preparation last year ?\n\nI learned about this open source program in my second year. But atleast I tried last year on a different organization’s project that was related to Data Visualization Recommendation for Data Science. But the problem was I did not contribute as much as this year and was too late in the application process. As usual Machine learning related projects have a lot of competition compared to other projects. I prepared on learning Data visualization in Machine Learning and existing Models for the recommendation system. Finally I wrote a proposal with the SeqToSeq model without much knowledge on neural networks at that time. And I did not communicate much through the dedicated slack channel.  That may be one of the reasons for the failure. But the main reason was my latency for GSoC 2019.\n\nHow did I hurdle GSoC 2020 ?\n\nSince the time I realized how open source is needed and helpful for the community, I have been passionate about contributing to open source projects. At the instance, I finished my internship in Bangalore, India in 2019, I immediately focused on participating in GSoC. This is my last year (2020) as a student of my BSc Computer Science life, I wanted to get selected this year as a student.\n\nThere was a guidance seminar organized by our department, I got to know that Jenkins had opened their project ideas. That was an extremely impressive beginning of my GSoC 2020 journey. I walked through all the draft and accepted projects in the Jenkins.io page. As I am already interested in Machine Learning and I am familiar with Java, I picked the most impressive idea for me that does not have an initial repo. That means I wanted to use my knowledge to think and research a lot with this project. But I had to contribute and want to know about the infrastructure of Jenkins codebase. Because that makes the selection panel easy to pick up the student for the project.  Then I repeatedly searched to contribute to Jenkins. I found issues that were easy for me to work from the git plugin and git client plugin. I started to contribute some test issues on git plugin and git client plugin. After I got a clear knowledge on how a plugin works in Jenkins, I started working on the POC with the hint provided in the project idea page. Actually, that was fun to code.\n\nMentors have helped many students during the application process. I was able to do a working POC that had a minimum capability to do the task of the project. Finally mentors opened for proposal submission. I hurried to prepare a draft proposal. After I got reviews from mentors, I started to improve the proposal. At the end of the proposal submission, I was able to deliver a good proposal for this project. As I was curious about this plugin, I dug into more on how to integrate Jupyter notebook with this plugin. I published an medium article as a result of my research during the acceptance waiting period.\n\nResults released\n\nThe result was going to be announced on 4th May, I believed in my project proposal and POC and I got selected for this GSoC 2020. Whoa ! That was a goosebumping moment in my entire life. The feeling was like Something I achieved. As a result of my hard work, I deserved that.\nFor example, I spent 7 days continuously making the POC work without any collision between maven artifacts.\n\nCommunity Bonding\n\nAfter the release of results, I was preparing myself for the community bonding. There are lots of interactions happening between me and mentors than before.I had to update my project page and my profile in Jenkins.io. We had our first meeting with lots of excitement and love on 10th of May. Mentors and I introduced ourselves even though we know each other. We discussed the high level view of GSoC and I asked some questions that I had in my mind. As my plugin was a new repository, most of the discussion was related to the repository and its name. I had  to find a name for the new plugin. We had regular conversations about the blogpost and presentations at the end.\n\nIn the second meeting, We discussed the process for hosting a new plugin in Jenkins, tracking issues with JIRA, blog posts and high level road map for the project. And I suggested some interesting plugin names but they were not matching to the goal of the project, mentors told me to try other names which perfectly describe the project. I was advised to read all the research guidelines and plugin naming conventions. We discussed how code reviews will be done and source code management through the git. After this meeting, our meeting has shifted to the official Jenkins Zoom account.\n\nOur third meeting was quite serious about our project planning. I had been preparing my design document for the project with the help of mentors before the meeting day. Hence I got lots of reviews and useful examples for my future work on phase 1. At this point, we decided with the plugin name Machine Learning Plugin which was accepted by all mentors and I created the repo and requested a Jira ticket for the plugin hosting request. We were planning to remind the Jira ticket within the next 3 days. Mentors want me to make sure I updated the Jenkins GSoC page before the community period ends. Lots of discussion carried about the design document that I had been preparing last week before the meeting. Some important points from the meeting notes follows :\n\nDefine features in the design document\n\nDiagrams for the operations\n\nHow plugin works in distributed environment\n\nCode editor library\n\nRequirements for the first Plugin release\n\nBlog post draft document\n\nToDo works for me for next week\n\nTherefore, I had to work hard after this meeting, this made me involved in the project more. I have to put my huge effort to make this opportunity golden. Our team has the willingness to complete this project and will definitely help the Data Science community with this plugin.\nKudos to my team for the amazing work so far!!!\n\nThis was my entire journey until now. Hope you enjoyed it and hope you learned the mistakes I made last year and corrected in this summer.\nThanks for reading, and Stay tuned I will be uploading blog posts for those of you interested.\n\nResources and Links\n\nProject page\n\nDesign document","title":"Machine Learning Plugin project - community bonding blog post","tags":["machinelearning","datascience","plugins","communitybonding","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/9b030/loghijiaha.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/f38b5/loghijiaha.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/bcd2b/loghijiaha.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/ceea6/loghijiaha.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/45b82/loghijiaha.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/933cd/loghijiaha.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/6c13d/loghijiaha.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":158}}},"blog":null,"github":"loghijiaha","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Computer Science and Engineering Student at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

Jenkins is not just a community, it is a family. When GSoC period was over, we received swags from Jenkins.\nNatasha Stopa (one of the students in GSoC 2019) was invited to attend DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco.\nIt was nice to see her enjoy there. But guess what? Jenkins also invited three other students (Abhyudaya, Long and me) to DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon.\nI was super psyched when Marky Jackson (one of my project mentors) broke the news to me.\n\nThe trip to Lisbon required to sort a few things like flight tickets, hotel booking, passport, visa etc. Oleg Nenashev had scheduled meetings to discuss\nand help us with arranging everything for our travel. Thanks to him. :)\n\nFrom India to Lisbon (Dec 1)\n\nAbhyudaya and I boarded our flight from Indira Gandhi Airport (New Delhi) to Lisbon on December 1, 2019 morning at 0500 hours (local time). It was a fine\ntrip with an hour layover in Istanbul Ataturk Airport. We arrived in Lisbon at 1500 hours (local time). The weather in Lisbon was terrific. A mild cold\nbut strong sea breeze was the starting point of me falling in love with the place. We arrived at our hotel (Novotel Lisboa) in an Uber. Oleg met us at\nthe lobby to help us with check-in. It was great to finally meet him in person after months of knowing and working together. We had a good chat about the\nevent, what to expect and other sightseeing areas. After a short time of refresh, Long who traveled from Berlin a day before met us at the restaurant. We\nhad a brief chat knowing each other, had our food and went to bed. The next day was Hackfest. We hit the bed after that as we had to reach Centro de\nCongressos de Lisboa (CCL) where the event was organised by 0900 hours.\n\nDay 0 (Dec 2)\n\nI woke up early for a short jog in the streets. Lisbon is a city made on hills. The streets have beautiful mosaic styled pavements. It was\nnice to see around the city. Then Abhyudaya and me went for breakfast and reached CCL in an Uber at 0815 hours.\n\nThere was a round table sitting arrangement in an auditorium. It was like a meet-and-greet event to interact with other developers (some known and some new).\nEverybody had to figure out their problem statements and work on it. There was milk, juice, sandwiches which gave us energy throughout the day. I took a\nsmall break to come out of the building to go to the other side of the road which was on the banks of Tagus River. From there you could have very close\nview underneath the Ponte 25 de Abril (looks strikingly similar to Golden Gate Bridge). You can also see The Sanctuary of Christ the King on the other side\nof the river (again looks similar to Christ the Redeemer in Rio, Brazil). It was great to kick off the event with Hackfest. At the end of Hackfest some of\nus presented our work. Later, we went to a nearby restaurant to have burgers which apparently was the best burger I ever had (could be because I hadn’t\ntried too many burgers before :P). We talked and interacted with people from other parts of the world for about an hour and a half then went back to our hotel\nrooms.\n\nDay 1 (Dec 3)\n\nThe conference officially began on this day. Abyudaya and me had breakfast and took the shuttle to CCL. We collected our t-shirts and IDs. The event managing team\nmade an app for DevOps World | Jenkins World (DWJW) Lisbon with all schedules and other informations which was incredibly convenient for all attendees.\nThere were multiple sessions/events on different topics related to Jenkins or DevOps in general. I attended the Jenkins and Jenkins X contributor summit.\nHad a nice lunch and went around to explore Lisbon. I went to Padrao dos Descobrimentos and the beautiful Belem Palace. Had some Pasteis de Belem\n(a popular Portuguese desert). Took a tram to Praça do Comércio. It is Lisbon’s most important square. You will find lots of tourists, street bands,\nsea food restaurants, shops for every budget, the famous pink street and so much more. Later that evening we had a party hosted by EURODOG (European\nDevOps Group) at Lisboa Marriott. It was a nice party to network with developers over casual wine and beer. We later head out to a nearby Indian restaurant\nfor Kebab and rice.\n\nDay 2 (Dec 4)\n\nThe second day began with the opening keynote. Later went to the Jenkins X Introduction, Deploying K8s with Jenkins on GCP, Build top mobile games\nby King in that order. Also occasionally hitting the sponsors booth to have a chat and collect some swags. In the evening there was the superhero\nthemed party, sponsored by Sonatype. It was probably the most fun event in the entire conference. The expo hall had an entirely different look with the party lights on,\npeople wearing capes, fun events going around. There were artists dressed in a Bumblebee, a Batman, a Superman, a Supergirl, a Thor and more superhero\ncostumes! I was previously made aware of the interesting parties at Jenkins World but the experience was very different. People from all over the world had\ncome together to celebrate the 15 years of success of an open source software. After partying from 5 to 7 we went back to the hotel. I spent some time\nto prepare the slides for the next day’s presentation and went to bed.\n\nDay 3 (Dec 5)\n\nThe third and final day of conference began with Jenkins World Fun Run. I missed the keynote for being late and other setup required for the\npresentation. My laptop was broken so had to do all the setup for demo on a friend’s laptop. The situation felt like a Jenkins admin under fire\nfor a production bug. After being under pressure for a while, took a break to admire the developer comics and had a chat with the graffiti painter.\nDuring lunch it was time for the GSoC presentation at the Jenkins community booth. All our presentation went well and we also interacted with real users.\nThen we had the GSoC Team pic at the Jenkins community booth. Later Abhyudaya and me gave our presentation at the lightning talks as well upon Mark Waite’s\nrequest. The event concluded with emotional goodbyes.\n\nAll GSoC Students were invited for dinner at Corinthia Lisboa’s Soul Garden restaurant. The party comprised of Oleg, Mark and his lovely wife, Liam, Tracy,\nAlyssa and Olivier. We had a very nice conversation and I had a very delicious Bacalhau (cod fish) dish. Then bid final goodbye to everybody.\n\nIt was a wonderful experience in a wonderful country among wonderful people. Hats off to the management team lead by Alyssa Tong and co. An event this big was\ncarried out without any hiccups! Everybody contributed their part to the event which made it very interactive and fun. Checkout some of my swags:\n\nA big shout out to the Jenkins project and CloudBees for sponsoring this trip. Also thank you Jenkins and Google Summer of Code for support. :)","title":"My DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon Experience","tags":["gitlab","devopsworld","jenkinsworld","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/20305/baymac.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/eb017/baymac.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/ed0e7/baymac.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/20305/baymac.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/b3c75/baymac.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/bcdad/baymac.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/21187/baymac.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/33025/baymac.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/d386c/baymac.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":192}}},"blog":null,"github":"baymac","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2019 student under Jenkins project.

I had an early morning flight to Lisbon\nfrom Delhi via Istanbul. At the Airport, I met Parichay who had been\nwaiting there from his connecting flight. After flying 8000 km, we\nreached Lisbon. We took a taxi to the hotel and were greeted there by\none of my Google Summer of Code mentors, Oleg. After four months of\nworking with him on my GSoC project, meeting him was an amazing\nexperience. Later that day, after stretching our legs in the hotel, we\nmet Long for an early dinner, who came to the hotel after exploring much\nof Lisbon.\n\nDay 1: Hackfest, December 2\n\nNext morning, we all met for breakfast where we all got to taste some\nPastel de Nata. We then took a cab to the Congress Centre for attending\nthe Jenkins and Jenkins X hackfest. At the Hackfest, I met Mark, Joseph,\nKasper, Andrey and other Jenkins contributors. I also met Oleg, this\ntime together with his son and his wife. After our introductions, and a\nshort presentation by Oleg, I started hacking on the Folder Auth plugin\nand made it possible to delete user sids from roles. The best part of\nhacking there was to get instant feedback on what I was working on. More\nand more people kept coming throughout the day. It was great to see so\nmany people working hard to improve Jenkins. At the end, everyone\npresented what they had achieved that day. Having skipped lunch for some\nsnacks, Oleg and others tried hard to get some pizza delivered without\nmuch success. After the Hackfest, everyone was hungry and most attendees\nincluding me went looking for nearby restaurants. Since it was early and\nmost restaurants were not open yet, we all decided to have burgers. It\nwas a great learning experience listening to and talking about Jenkins,\nElasticsearch, Jira, GitHub and a lot of other things. After that, we\ntook a taxi back to the hotel and I went to bed.\n\nDay 2: Contributor Summit, December 3\n\nWe had the Jenkins and Jenkins X contributor summit the next day. Me and\nParichay took the bus to the Congress Centre in the morning. After\nregistration, I got my ‘Speaker’ badge and the conference T-shirt. The\ncontributor summit took place in the same hall as the Hackfest, but the\nseating arrangement was completely different and there were a lot more\npeople. The summit started with everyone introducing themselves. It\nturned out that there were a lot of people from Munich. There were\npresentations and talks about all things Jenkins, Jenkins X and the\nContinuous Delivery Foundation by Kohsuke, Oleg, Joseph, Liam, Olivier,\nWadek and others. I had no experience with Jenkins X which made the\nsummit very interesting. After lunch, the talks were over, and everyone\nwas free to join any session discussing various things about Jenkins. I\nattended the Cloud Native Jenkins and the Configuration-as-Code\nsessions.\n\nWhile some of the conference attendees were in the Contributor summit,\nthe others were going through certifications and trainings. At around 5\no’clock in the evening, the summit and the trainings all got over and\nthe expo hall was thrown open. On the entrance, there was a large stack\nof big DWJW bags. I did not realize why those bags were kept there.\nSince everyone was taking one, I took one as well. As soon as I went\ninto the hall, I realized that those bags were for collecting swag. I\nhad never seen anything like this where sponsors were just giving away\nT-shirts, stickers and other stuff. There were snacks and Kohsuke was\ncutting the extremely tasty 15 years of Jenkins cake. After having the\ncake, I went on a swag-collecting spree going from one sponsor booth to\nthe other. This was an amazing experience, not only was I able to get\ncool stuff, I was also able to learn a lot about the software these\ncompanies made and how it fits into the DevOps pipeline.\n\nAfter the conference got over, me, Long and Parichay went to the Lisbon\nMariott Hotel for the Eurodog party. After collecting another T-shirt, I\nwent to the nearest restaurant (McDonald’s) with Andrey who I had\nearlier met at the Hackfest.\n\nDay 3: December 4\n\nThis was the first official day of the conference and it began with the\nkeynote. There were over 900 people in the keynote hall. It was amazing\nto see so many people attending the conference. After the keynote got\nover, I went to several sessions throughout the day learning about how\ncompanies are using Jenkins and implementing DevOps tools.\n\nIn the evening, we had the Sonatype Superparty which was a lot of fun.\nThere were neon lights, arcade machines, VR experiences, superheroes and\nmore swag. There was a lot of good food including pizzas and burgers and\nhot dogs. Superhero inspired desserts were very interesting. I was able\nto talk to Oleg and Wadek about the security challenges in Jenkins.\nDuring the party, I also got a chance to meet the CEO of CloudBees,\nSacha Labourey.\n\nDay 4, December 5\n\nThis was the last day of the conference and it began with another\nkeynote. After the keynote, I attended a very interesting talk on how\nthe European Observatory built software for large telescopes using\nJenkins. After that, I prepared for my talk on the work I did during\nGoogle Summer of Code 2019. I had my presentation in the community booth\nduring the lunch time. Presenting in front of real people was an amazing\nexperience and very different from the ones we had on Zoom chats for our\nGSoC evaluations. In the evening, I got another chance to present my\nproject at the Jenkins Community Lightning Talks.\n\nAfter that, the conference came to an end and I went back to the hotel.\nAfter relaxing for some time, me, Parichay and Long were invited by Oleg\nto a dinner at Corinthia Hotel with Kohsuke, Mark and his wife, Tracy,\nAlyssa, and Liam. Unfortunately, Long couldn’t attend the dinner because\nhe had the flight back earlier that evening. After the amazing dinner, I\nthanked everyone for such an amazing trip and said goodbye.\n\nDWJW was the best experience I’ve ever had. I was able to learn about a\nlot of new things and talk to some amazing people. In the end, I would\nlike to especially thank Oleg for helping me throughout and making it\npossible for me to attend such a wonderful conference. I would like to\nthank my other mentors Runze Xia and Supun for their support in my\nGoogle Summer of Code project. I would like to thank Google for\norganizing Google Summer of Code, everyone at Jenkins project for\nsponsoring my travel, and CloudBees for inviting me to the conference.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you all again soon!","title":"Trip to DevOps World | Jenkins

Summer of Code is much more than a summer internship program, it is a year-round effort for the organization and some community members.\nNow, after the DevOps World | Jenkins World conference in Lisbon and final retrospective meetings, we can say that GSoC 2019 is officially over.\nWe would like to start by thanking all participants: students, mentors, subject matter experts and all other contributors who proposed project ideas, participated in student selection, in community bonding and in further discussions and reviews.\nGoogle Summer of Code is a major effort which would not be possible without the active participation of the Jenkins community.\n\nIn this blogpost we would like to share the results and our experience from the previous year.\n\nResults\n\nFive GSoC projects were successfully completed this year:\nRole Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements,\nPlugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library,\nWorking Hours Plugin - UI Improvements,\nRemoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features,\nMulti-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM.\nWe will talk about the projects a little later in the document.\n\nProject details\n\nWe held the final presentations as Jenkins Online Meetups in late August and Google published the results on Sept 3rd.\nThe final presentations can be found here:\nPart 1,\nPart 2,\nPart 3.\nWe also presented the\n2019 Jenkins GSoC report\nat the DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco\nand at the\nDevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Lisbon conferences.\n\nIn the following sections, we present a brief summary of each project, links to the coding phase 3 presentations, and to the final products.\n\nRole Strategy Plugin Performance Improvements\n\nRole Strategy Plugin is one of the most widely used authorization plugins for Jenkins,\nbut it has never been famous for performance due to architecture issues and regular expression checks for project roles.\nAbhyudaya Sharma was working on this project together with hist mentors:\nOleg Nenashev, Runze Xia and Supun Wanniarachchi.\nHe started the project from creating a new Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins based on JMH,\ncreated benchmarks and achieved a 3501% improvement on some real-world scenarios.\nThen he went further and created a new Folder-based Authorization Strategy Plugin which offers even better performance for Jenkins instances where permissions are scoped to folders.\nDuring his project Abhyudaya also fixed the Jenkins Configuration-as-Code support in Role Strategy and contributed several improvements and fixes to the JCasC Plugin itself.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins,\nIntroducing new Folder Authorization Plugin, Performance Improvements to Role Strategy Plugin\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nSource code: Role Strategy Plugin, Folder Authorization Plugin\n\nPlugins Installation Manager CLI Tool/Library\n\nNatasha Stopa was working on a new CLI tool for plugin management,\nwhich should unify features available in other tools like install-plugins.sh in Docker images.\nIt also introduced many new features like YAML configuration format support, listing of available updates and security fixes.\nThe newly created tool should eventually replace the previous ones.\nNatasha’s mentors: Kristin Whetstone, Jon Brohauge and Arnab Banerjee.\nAlso, many contributors from Platform SIG and JCasC plugin team joined the project as a key stakeholders and subject-matter experts.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: alpha release announcement,\ncoding phase 2 updates\n\nFinal evaluation: slides,\nvideo\n\nSource code: Plugin installation manager tool\n\nWorking Hours Plugin - UI Improvements\n\nJenkins UI and frontend framework are a common topic in the Jenkins project,\nespecially in recent months after the new UX SIG was established.\nJack Shen was working on exploring new ways to build Jenkins Web UI together with his mentor Jeff Pearce.\nJack updated the Working Hours Plugin to use UI controls provided by standard React libraries.\nThen he documented his experienced and created template for plugins with React-based UI.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog posts: Updates on Working Hours Plugin UI,\nReact Plugin Template\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nSource code: Working Hours Plugin, Template for Jenkins plugins with React-based UI\n\nRemoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features\n\nLong Le Vu Nguyen was working on extended Kubernetes support in the Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin.\nHis mentors were Andrey Falco and Pham vu Tuan who was our GSoC 2018 student and the plugin creator.\nDuring this project Long has added a new agent launcher which provisions Jenkins agents in Kubernetes and connects them to the controller.\nHe also created a Cloud API implementation for it and a new Helm chart which can provision Jenkins as entire system in Kubernetes,\nwith Apache Kafka enabled by default.\nAll these features were released in Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0.\n\nProject page\n\nBlog post for [Remoting over Apache Kafka Plugin 2.0\n\nFinal evaluation: slides, video\n\nPlugin source code\n\nMulti-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab SCM\n\nParichay Barpanda was working on the new GitLab Branch Source Plugin with Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs and Folder Organisation support.\nHis mentors were\nMarky Jackson-Taulia,\nJustin Harringa,\nZhao Xiaojie and\nJoseph Petersen.\nThe plugin scans the projects, importing the pipeline jobs it identifies based on the criteria provided.\nAfter a project is imported, Jenkins immediately runs the jobs based on the Jenkinsfile pipeline script and notifies the status to GitLab Pipeline Status.\nThis plugin also provides GitLab server configuration which can be configured in Configure System or via Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC).\nread more about this project in the GitLab Branch Source 1.0 announcement.\n\nProject page\n\nCoding phase 3 presentation\n\nGitlab Branch Source Plugin, Gitlab API plugin\n\nProjects which were not completed\n\nNot all projects have been completed this year.\nWe were also working on Artifact Promotion plugin for Jenkins Pipeline\nand on Cloud Features for External Workspace Manager Plugin,\nbut unfortunately both projects were stopped after coding phase 1.\nAnyway, we got a lot of experience and takeaways in these areas (see linked Jira tickets!.\nWe hope that these stories will be implemented by Jenkins contributors at some point.\nGoogle Summer of Code 2020 maybe?\n\nRunning the GSoC program at our organization level\n\nHere are some of the things our organization did before and during GSoC behind the scenes.\nTo prepare for the influx of students, we updated all our GSoC pages and wrote down all the knowledge we accumulated over the years of running the program.\nWe started preparing in October 2018, long before the official start of the program.\nThe main objective was to address the feedback we got during GSoC 2018 retrospectives.\n\nProject ideas.\nWe started gathering project ideas in the last months of 2018.\nWe prepared a list of project ideas in a Google doc, and we tracked ownership of each project in a table of that document.\nEach project idea was further elaborated in its own Google doc.\nWe find that when projects get complicated during the definition phase, perhaps they are really too complicated and should not be done.\n\nSince we wanted all the project ideas to be documented the same way, we created a template to guide the contributors.\nMost of the project idea documents were written by org admins or mentors, but occasionally a student proposed a genuine idea.\nWe also captured contact information in that document such as GitHub and Gitter handles, and a preliminary list of potential mentors for the project.\nWe embedded all the project documents on our website.\n\nMentor and student guidelines.\nWe updated the mentor information page with details on what we expect mentors to do during the program,\nincluding the number of hours that are expected from mentors,\nand we even have a section on preventing conflict of interest.\nWhen we recruit mentors, we point them to the mentor information page.\n\nWe also updated the student information page.\nWe find this is a huge time saver as every student contacting us has the same questions about joining and participating in the program.\nInstead of re-explaining the program each time, we send them a link to those pages.\n\nApplication phase.\nStudents started to reach out very early on as well, many weeks before GSoC officially started.\nThis was very motivating.\nSome students even started to work on project ideas before the official start of the program.\n\nProject selection. This year the org admin team had some very difficult decisions to make.\nWith lots of students, lots of projects and lots of mentors, we had to request the right number of slots and try to match the projects with the most chances of success.\nWe were trying to form mentor teams at the same time as we were requesting the number of slots, and it was hard to get responses from all mentors in time for the deadline.\nFinally we requested fewer slots than we could have filled.\nWhen we request slots, we submit two numbers: a minimum and a maximum. The GSoC guide states that:\n\nThe minimum is based on the projects that are so amazing they really want to see these projects occur over the summer,\n\nand the maximum number should be the number of solid and amazing projects they wish to mentor over the summer.\n\nWe were awarded minimum. So we had to make very hard decisions: we had to decide between \"amazing\" and \"solid\" proposals.\nFor some proposals, the very outstanding ones, it’s easy.\nBut for the others, it’s hard.\nWe know we cannot make the perfect decision, and by experience, we know that some students or some mentors will not be able to complete the program due to uncontrollable life events, even for the outstanding proposals.\nSo we have to make the best decision knowing that some of our choices won’t complete the program.\n\nCommunity Bonding.\nWe have found that the community bonding phase was crucial to the success of each project.\nUsually projects that don’t do well during community bonding have difficulties later on.\nIn order to get students involved in the community better, almost all projects were handled under the umbrella of Special Interest Groups so that there were more stakeholders and communications.\n\nCommunications.\nEvery year we have students who contact mentors via personal messages.\nStudents, if you are reading this, please do NOT send us personal messages about the projects, you will not receive any preferential treatment.\nObviously, in open source we want all discussions to be public, so students have to be reminded of that regularly.\nIn 2019 we are using Gitter chat for most communications, but from an admin point of view this is more fragmented than mailing lists.\nIt is also harder to search.\nChat rooms are very convenient because they are focused, but from an admin point of view, the lack of threads in Gitter makes it hard to get an overview.\nGitter threads were added recently (Nov 2019) but do not yet work well on Android and iOS.\nWe adopted Zoom Meetings towards the end of the program and we are finding it easier to work with than Google Hangouts.\n\nStatus tracking.\nAnother thing that was hard was to get an overview of how all the projects were doing once they were running.\nWe made extensive use of Google sheets to track lists of projects and participants during the program\nto rank projects and to track statuses of project phases (community bonding, coding, etc.).\nIt is a challenge to keep these sheets up to date, as each project involves several people and several links.\nWe have found it time consuming and a bit hard to keep these sheets up to date, accurate and complete, especially up until the start of the coding phase.\n\nPerhaps some kind of objective tracking tool would help.\nWe used Jenkins Jira for tracking projects, with each phase representing a separate sprint.\nIt helped a lot for successful projects.\nIn our organization, we try to get everyone to beat the deadlines by a couple of days, because we know that there might be events such as power outages,\nbad weather (happens even in Seattle!), or other uncontrolled interruptions, that might interfere with submitting project data.\nWe also know that when deadlines coincide with weekends, there is a risk that people may forget.\n\nRetrospective.\nAt the end of our project, we also held a retrospective and captured some ideas for the future.\nYou can find the notes here.\nWe already addressed the most important comments in our documentation and project ideas for the next year.\n\nRecognition\n\nLast year, we wanted to thank everyone who participated in the program by sending swag.\nThis year, we collected all the mailing addresses we could and sent to everyone we could the 15-year Jenkins special edition T-shirt, and some stickers.\nThis was a great feel good moment.\nI want to personally thank Alyssa Tong her help on setting aside the t-shirt and stickers.\n\nMentor summit\n\nEach year Google invites two or more mentors from each organization to the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit.\nAt this event, hundreds of open-source project maintainers and mentors meet together and have unconference sessions targeting GSoC, community management and various tools.\nThis year the summit was held in Munich,\nand we sent Marky Jackson and Oleg Nenashev as representatives there.\n\nApart from discussing projects and sharing chocolate, we also presented Jenkins there, conducted a lightning talk and hosted the unconference session about automation bots for GitHub.\nWe did not make a team photo there, so try to find Oleg and Marky on this photo:\n\nGSoC Team at DevOps World | Jenkins World\n\nWe traditionally use GSoC organization payments and travel grants to sponsor student trips to major Jenkins-related events.\nThis year four students traveled to the DevOps World | Jenkins World conferences in San-Francisco and Lisbon.\nStudents presented their projects at the community booth and at the contributor summits,\nand their presentations got a lot of traction in the community!\n\nThanks a lot to Google and CloudBees who made these trips possible.\nYou can find a travel report from Natasha Stopa here,\nmore travel reports are coming soon.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis year, five projects were successfully completed.\nWe find this to be normal and in line with what we hear from other participating organizations.\n\nTaking the time early to update our GSoC pages saved us a lot of time later because we did not have to repeat all the information every time someone contacted us.\nWe find that keeping track of all the mentors, the students, the projects, and the meta information is a necessary but time consuming task.\nWe wish we had a tool to help us do that.\nCoordinating meetings and reminding participants of what needs to be accomplished for deadlines is part of the cheerleading aspect of GSoC, we need to keep doing this.\n\nLastly, I want to thank again all participants, we could not do this without you.\nEach year we are impressed by the students who do great work and bring great contributions to the Jenkins community.\n\nGSoC 2020?\n\nYes, there will be Google Summer of Code 2020!\nWe plan to participate, and we are looking for project ideas, mentors and students.\nJenkins GSoC pages have been already updated towards the next year, and we invite everybody interested to join us next year!\n\nMain page with all contacts\n\nGSoC 2020 Project
