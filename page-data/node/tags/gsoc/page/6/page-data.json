In particular, we’ve been focusing on getting the tool ready to\nincorporate into the Jenkins Docker Image to replace the\ninstall-plugins.sh bash script\nto download plugins.  This work included parsing improvements so that blank lines and comments in the\nplugins.txt file are filtered out, allowing update centers and the plugin download\ndirectory to be set via environment variables or CLI Options, creating Windows\ncompatible defaults, and fixing a bug in which dependencies for specific\nplugin versions were not always getting resolved correctly.\n\nIn parallel to getting the tool ready for Jenkins Docker integration, Phase 2 saw\nthe addition of several new features.\n\nYaml Input\n\nIn addition to specifying the plugins they want to download via the --plugins\nCLI option or through a .txt file, users can now use a Jenkins yaml file with a\nplugins root element.\n\nSay goodbye to the days of specifying incremental\nplugins like incrementals;org.jenkins-ci.plugins.workflow;2.20-rc530.b4f7f7869384 -\n  you can enter the artifactId, groupId, and version to specify an incremental plugin.\n\nMaking the Download Process More Transparent\n\nPreviously, the plugin download process was not very transparent to users - it was\ndifficult to know the final set of plugins that would be downloaded after pulling in\nall the dependencies.  Instead of determing the set of plugins that will be downloaded\nat the time of download, users now have the option to see the full set of plugins\nand their versions that will be downloaded in advance. With the --list CLI\noption, users can see all currently downloaded and bundled plugins, the set of all\nplugins that will be downloaded, and the effective plugin set - the set of all\nplugins that are already downloaded or will be downloaded.\n\nViewing Information About plugins\n\nNow that you know which plugins will be downloaded, wouldn’t it be nice to know\nif these are the latest versions or if any of the versions you want to install have\nsecurity warnings?  You can do that now too.\n\nNext Steps and Additional Information\n\nThe updates mentioned in this blog will be released soon so you can try them out.\nThe focus of Phase 3 will be to continue to iterate upon and improve the library\nand CLI. We hope to release a first version and submit a pull request to Jenkins Docker soon.\nThanks to everyone who has already tried it out and given feedback! I will also be\npresenting my work at DevOps World\nin San Francisco in a few weeks.  You can use the code PREVIEW for a discounted registration\n($799 instead of $1,499).\n\nFeel free to reach out through\nthe Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list.

My project for Google Summer of Code 2019 is Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features. This is the first time I have contributed for Jenkins and I am very excited to announce the features that have been done in Phase 1.\n\nProject Introduction\n\nCurrent version of Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin requires users to manually configure the entire system which includes Zookeeper, Kafka and remoting agents. It also doesn’t support dynamic agent provisioning so scalability is harder to achieve. My project aims to solve two problems:\n\nOut-of-the-box solution to provision Apache Kafka cluster.\n\nDynamic agent provisioning in a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nCurrent State\n\nKubernetes connector with credentials supported.\n\nApache Kafka provisioning in Kubernetes feature is fully implemented.\n\nHelm chart is partially implemented.\n\nApache Kafka provisioning in Kubernetes\n\nThis feature is part of 2.0 version so it is not yet released officially. You can try out the feature by using the Experimental Update Center to update to 2.0.0-alpha version or building directly from master branch:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting-kafka-plugin.git\ncd remoting-kafka-plugin/plugin\nmvn hpi:run\n\nOn the Global Configuration page, users can input Kubernetes server information and credentials. Then they can start Apache Kafka with only one button click.\n\nWhen users click Start Kafka on Kubernetes button, Jenkins will create a Kubernetes client from the information and then apply Zookeeper and Kafka YAML specification files from resources.\n\nHelm Chart\n\nHelm chart for Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin is based on stable/jenkins chart and incubator/kafka chart. As of now, the chart is still a Work in Progress because it is still waiting for Cloud API implementation in Phase 2. However, you can check out the demo chart with a single standalone Remoting Kafka Agent:\n\ngit clone -b demo-helm-phase-1 https://github.com/longngn/remoting-kafka-plugin.git\ncd remoting-kafka-plugin\nK8S_NODE=./helm/jenkins-remoting-kafka/do.sh start\n\nThe command do.sh start will do the following steps:\n\nInstall the chart (with Jenkins and Kafka).\n\nLaunch a Kafka computer on Jenkins controller by applying the following JCasC.\n\njenkins:\n  nodes:\n    - permanent:\n        name: \"test\"\n        remoteFS: \"/home/jenkins\"\n        launcher:\n          kafka: {}\n\nLaunch a single Remoting Kafka Agent pod.\n\nYou can check the chart state by running kubectl, for example:\n\n$ kubectl get all -n demo-helm\nNAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/demo-jenkins-998bcdfd4-tjmjs        2/2     Running   0          6m30s\npod/demo-jenkins-remoting-kafka-agent   1/1     Running   0          4m10s\npod/demo-kafka-0                        1/1     Running   0          6m30s\npod/demo-zookeeper-0                    1/1     Running   0          6m30s\n\nNAME                              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE\nservice/demo-0-external           NodePort    10.106.254.187 19092:31090/TCP              6m30s\nservice/demo-jenkins              NodePort    10.101.84.33 8080:31465/TCP               6m31s\nservice/demo-jenkins-agent        ClusterIP   10.97.169.65 50000/TCP                    6m31s\nservice/demo-kafka                ClusterIP   10.106.248.10 9092/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-kafka-headless       ClusterIP   None 9092/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-zookeeper            ClusterIP   10.109.222.63 2181/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-zookeeper-headless   ClusterIP   None 2181/TCP,3888/TCP,2888/TCP   6m31s\n\nNAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/demo-jenkins   1/1     1            1           6m30s\n\nNAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\nreplicaset.apps/demo-jenkins-998bcdfd4   1         1         1       6m30s\n\nNAME                              READY   AGE\nstatefulset.apps/demo-kafka       1/1     6m30s\nstatefulset.apps/demo-zookeeper   1/1     6m30s\n\nNext Phase Plan\n\nImplement Cloud API to provision Remoting Kafka Agent.

Jobs that run outside of configured working hours are held until the next allowable build time.\n\nFor the first code phase at Google Summer of Code, I’ve been working on Working Hours Project, which needed improvements on usability.\n\nRather than classical Jelly pages, React seems to be more prefered when we want to design a much customized UI with a huge amount of libraries we could use, especially the open source components such as date pickers.\n\nBut we have to face a challenge of the integration of React and Jenkins, which I’m currently working on.\n\nAchievements For The First Code Phase\n\nFor the first code phase, we are focusing on the UI improvements, we’ve achieved following major improvements:\n\nA standalone webapp which could be then integrated.\n\nSlider for choosing a time range.\n\nMore fields when setting a excluded date.\n\nPresets for choosing a excluded date.\n\nA Jenkins styling UI.\n\nHow We Integrate React Into Jenkins\n\nA solution doc for integration could be found at\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1JLRCDg9JNBWR0Dfq8w3pTI9mrl6i9JU29pBoH6bO0J8\n\nAt first, we found BlueOcean is a great example for using React in Jenkins, but yet it’s not a choice for common development with plugins. So we need to find out another way to integrate.\n\nHere are the steps to do the integration:\n\nA mount point in your jelly file, usually it’s a element with a unique id.\n\nWrite your React Application, but need to set the mount point to the id you set above.\n\nCopy the output after you build the Project into the plugin’s webapp dir.\n\nAdd your files using a script tag in your jelly file.\n\nOnce we are using React, the traditional jelly request won’t be available anymore, another way to process requests will be using stapler. You can define a process function like below.\n[source, java]\n\npublic HttpResponse doDynamic(StaplerRequest request) {\n        if (config == null) {\n            config = ExtensionList.lookup(WorkingHoursPlugin.class).get(0);\n        }\n        String restOfPath = request.getRestOfPath();\n        String[] pathTokens = restOfPath.split(\"/\");\n        List params = new ArrayList<>();\n        switch (params.get(0)) {\n            case \"list-excluded-dates\":\n                return listExcludedDate(request);\n            case \"set-excluded-dates\":\n                return setExcludedDates(request);\n            case \"list-time-ranges\":\n                return listTimeRanges(request);\n            case \"set-time-ranges\":\n                return setTimeRanges(request);\n        }\n    }\n\nRun Our Application\n\nIf you would like to take a look at our plugin, you can go to the repo\nworking-hours-plugin\n\nJust follow the README file, then you could run a copy of your working hours plugin.\n\nScreenshots\n\nThe current plugin’s outlook is a bit simple and the plugin is a bit unconvinient for use.\n\nOne of the problems is that if we want to input a excluded date, it’ll be a string in a constant format like 15/9/2019, but the new UI choosed React so we could use a datepicker to improve this.\n\nCurrent Plugin\n\nNew (Time Ranges)\n\nNew (Exclude Dates)\n\nHelpful links\n\nIf you have any questions or advices, we are glad to hear from you.\n\nSeveral useful links are listed below:\n\nDevelop Repo\n\nMain Repo\n\nDesign Doc\n\nDoc for React Integration Solution\n\nGitter Chat\n\nSlides for Phase 1 Demo\n\nVideo Recording for Phase 1","title":"GSOC Phase 1 Updates On Working Hours Plugin","tags":["react","plugins","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/77b35/jackshen.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/d4a57/jackshen.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/14734/jackshen.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ef6ff/jackshen.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/8257c/jackshen.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/f4bd7/jackshen.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/65cd2/jackshen.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":129}}},"blog":null,"github":"ShenJack","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Shen is a student from Beijing Forestry University.

We instead decided to start by converting the\ninstall-plugins.sh bash script in Jenkins Docker to Java.\nThere are several issues with the install-plugins.sh script - namely, that it is a bash script and has limited extensibility.\nFurthermore, it does not retrieve all of the most-up-to-date update center metadata.\n\nAlpha Release Details\n\nMimicking what was done in the install-plugins.sh script from the official Jenkins Docker image, the new plugin management library takes in a list of plugins, their versions,\nand/or urls from which to download the plugins, and downloads the requested plugins and their dependencies. The plugins are downloaded from the update center\nto a specified directory, and can then be loaded into Jenkins. Currently, the plugins to be downloaded can be specified via a plugins.txt file and/or the -plugins cli option, but we plan to further expand the input formats that can be accepted.\nCustom version specifiers for different update centers are also supported.\n\nThe library will first check if any of the requested plugins are currently either installed in the user-specified download location or user-specified Jenkins war file.\nAlready installed plugins will be ignored or upgraded if a higher version is requested or required as a dependency.  After determining the plugin download URL, the library\nwill download the plugins and resolve and download their dependencies.\n\nThis is just the beginning: the plugin manager library and cli tool are very much still a work in progress.\nFor the most up-to-date information on CLI options and how to run the tool, see the repository README.md.\nMore robust input parsing, support for security warnings and available updates, Docker integration, and additional features coming soon!\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nFeel free to reach out through\nthe Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list.

In future, this package should\nbe moved into a new plugin.\n\nio.jenkins.plugins.gitlabbranchsource - Adds GitLab Branch Source for Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs (including\nMerge Requests) and Folder organisation.\n\nPresent State\n\nFreeStyle Job and Pipeline(Single Branch) Job are fully supported.\n\nMulti-branch Pipeline Job is partially supported (no MRs detection).\n\nGitLab Folder Organisation is not supported.\n\nGoals of this project\n\nImplement a lightweight GitLab Plugin that depends on GitLab API Plugin.\n\nFollow convention of 3 separate plugins i.e. GitLab Plugin, GitLab API Plugin, GitLab Branch Source Plugin.\n\nImplement GitLab Branch Source Plugin with support for Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs.\n\nSupport new Jenkins features such as\nJenkins Code as Configuration (JCasC),\nIncremental Tools.\n\nClear & Efficient design.\n\nSupport new SCM Trait APIs.\n\nSupport Java 8 and above.\n\nBuilding the plugin\n\nNo binaries are available for this plugin as the plugin is in the very early alpha stage, and not ready for the general\npublic quite yet.  If you want to jump in early, you can try building it yourself from source.\n\nInstallation:\n\nCheckout source code to your local machine:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/baymac/gitlab-branch-source-plugin.git\n\ncd gitlab-branch-source-plugin\n\nInstall the plugin:\n\nmvn clean install\n\nmvn clean install -DskipTests # to skip tests\n\nRun the plugin:\n\nmvn hpi:run # runs a Jenkins instance at localhost:8080\n\nmvn hpi:run -Djetty.port= # to run on your desired port number\n\nIf you want to test it with your Jenkins server, after mvn clean install follow these steps in your Jenkins instance:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Manage Plugins\n\nSelect Advanced tab\n\nIn Upload Plugin section, select Choose file\n\nSelect $ /target/gitlab-branch-source.hpi\n\nSelect Upload\n\nSelect Install without restart\n\nUsage\n\nAssuming plugin installation has done been already.\n\nSetting up GitLab Server Configuration on Jenkins\n\nOn jenkins, select Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Configure System\n\nScroll down to find the GitLab section\n\nSelect Add GitLab Server | Select GitLab Server\n\nNow you will now see the GitLab Server Configuration options.\n\nThere are 4 fields that needs to be configured:\n\nName - Plugin automatically generates an unique server name for you. User may want to configure this field\nto suit their needs but should make sure it is sufficiently unique. We recommend to keep it as it is.\n\nServer URL - Contains the URL to your GitLab Server. By default it is set to \"https://gitlab.com\". User can\nmodify it to enter their GitLab Server URL e.g. https://gitlab.gnome.org/, http://gitlab.example.com:7990. etc.\n\nCredentials - Contains a list of credentials entries that are of type GitLab Personal Access Token. When\nno credential has been added it shows \"-none-\". User can add a credential by clicking \"Add\" button.\n\nWeb Hook - This field is a checkbox. If you want the plugin to setup a webhook on your GitLab project(s)\nrelated jobs, check this box. The plugin listens to a URL for the concerned GitLab project(s) and when an event\noccurs in the GitLab Server, the server sends an event trigger to the URL where the web hook is setup. If you\nwant continuous integration (or continuous delivery) on your GitLab project then you may want to automatically\nset it up.\n\nAdding a Personal Access Token Credentials (To automatically generate Personal Access Token see\nnext section):\n\nUser is required to add a GitLab Personal Access Token type credentials entry to securely persist the token\ninside Jenkins.\n\nGenerate a Personal Access Token on your GitLab Server:\n\nSelect profile dropdown menu from top-right corner\n\nSelect Settings\n\nSelect Access Token from left column\n\nEnter a name | Set Scope to api, read_user, read_repository\n\nSelect Create Personal Access Token\n\nCopy the token generated\n\nReturn to Jenkins | Select Add in Credentials field | Select Jenkins\n\nSet Kind to GitLab Personal Access Token\n\nEnter Token\n\nEnter a unique id in ID\n\nEnter a human readable description\n\nSelect Add\n\nTesting connection:\n\nSelect your desired token in the Credentials dropdown\n\nSelect Test Connection\n\nIt should return something like Credentials verified for user\n\nSelect Apply (at the bottom)\n\nGitLab Server is now setup on Jenkins\n\nCreating Personal Access Token within Jenkins\n\nAlternatively, users can generate a GitLab Personal Access Token within Jenkins itself and automatically add the\nGitLab Personal Access Token credentials to Jenkins server credentials.\n\nSelect Advanced at the bottom of GitLab Section\n\nSelect Manage Additional GitLab Actions\n\nSelect Convert login and password to token\n\nSet the GitLab Server URL\n\nThere are 2 options to generate token;\n\nFrom credentials - To select an already persisting Username Password Credentials or add an Username Password\ncredential to persist it.\n\nFrom login and password - If this is a one time thing then you can directly enter you credentials to the text boxes\nand the username/password credential is not persisted.\n\nAfter setting your username/password credential, select Create token credentials.\n\nThe token creator will create a Personal Access Token in your GitLab Server for the given user with the\nrequired scope and also create a credentials for the same inside Jenkins server. You can go back to the GitLab Server\nConfiguration to select the new credentials generated (select \"-none-\" first then new credentials will appear). For\nsecurity reasons this token is not revealed as plain text rather returns an id. It is a 128-bit long UUID-4 string\n(36 characters).\n\nConfiguration as Code\n\nNo need for messing around in the UI. Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) or simply Configuration as Code Plugin\nallows you to configure Jenkins via a yaml file. If you are a first time user, you can learn more about JCasC\nhere.\n\nAdd configuration YAML:\n\nThere are multiple ways to load JCasC yaml file to configure Jenkins:\n\nJCasC by default searches for a file with the name jenkins.yaml in $JENKINS_ROOT.\n\nThe JCasC looks for an environment variable CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG which contains the path\nfor the configuration yaml file.\n\nA path to a folder containing a set of config files e.g. /var/jenkins_home/casc_configs.\n\nA full path to a single file e.g. /var/jenkins_home/casc_configs/jenkins.yaml.\n\nA URL pointing to a file served on the web e.g. /jenkins.yaml\" class=\"bare\">https:// /jenkins.yaml .\n\nYou can also set the configuration yaml path in the UI. Go to /configuration-as-code.\nEnter path or URL to jenkins.yaml and select Apply New Configuration.\n\nAn example of configuring GitLab server via jenkins.yaml :\n\ncredentials:\n  system:\n    domainCredentials:\n      - credentials:\n          - gitlabPersonalAccessToken:\n              scope: SYSTEM\n              id: \"i<3GitLab\"\n              token: \"XfsqZvVtAx5YCph5bq3r\" # gitlab personal access token\n\nunclassified:\n  gitLabServers:\n    servers:\n      - credentialsId: \"i<3GitLab\"\n        manageHooks: true\n        name: \"gitlab.com\"\n        serverUrl: \"https://gitlab.com\"\n\nFor better security, see handling secrets\nsection in JCasC\ndocumentation.\n\nFuture Scope of work\n\nThe second phase of GSoC will be utilized to develop GitLab Branch Source. The new feature is a work in progress, but\nthe codebase is unstable and requires lot of bugfixes. Some features like Multibranch Pipeline Jobs are functioning\nproperly. More about it at the end of second phase.\n\nIssue Tracking\n\nThis project uses Jenkins JIRA to track issues. You can file issues under\ngitlab-branch-source-plugin component.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis plugin is built and maintained by the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Team for\nMulti-branch Pipeline\nSupport for GitLab.

To make our job a bit easier,\nwe chose Java Microbenchmark Harness for running these benchmarks. This\nallows us to reliably measure performance of our time-critical functions and will help make Jenkins perform faster\nfor everyone.\n\nThe micro-benchmarking framework was recently released in the Jenkins Unit Test Harness 2.50.\nThe blog post below shows how to run benchmarks in your plugins.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe framework runs works by starting a temporary Jenkins instance for each fork of the JMH benchmark,\njust like JenkinsRule from Jenkins Test Harness. Benchmarks are run directly from your JUnit Tests which allows\nyou to fail builds on the fly and easily run benchmarks from your IDE, just like unit tests. You can easily\nconfigure your benchmarks by either using your Java methods, or by using Jenkins Configuration-as-Code plugin\nand passing the path to your YAML file.\n\nTo run benchmarks from your plugins, you need to do the following:\n\nbump up the minimum required Jenkins version to 2.60.3 or above\n\nbump Plugin-POM to a version ≥ 3.46 or manually upgrade to Jenkins Test Harness ≥ 2.51.\n\nNow, to run the benchmarks, you need to have a benchmark runner that contains a @Test so it can run\nlike a JUnit test. From inside a test method, you can use the OptionsBuilder provided by JMH to\nconfigure your benchmarks. For example:\n\npublic class BenchmarkRunner {\n    @Test\n    public void runJmhBenchmarks() throws Exception {\n        ChainedOptionsBuilder options = new OptionsBuilder()\n                .mode(Mode.AverageTime)\n                .forks(2)\n                .result(\"jmh-report.json\");\n\n        // Automatically detect benchmark classes annotated with @JmhBenchmark\n        new BenchmarkFinder(getClass()).findBenchmarks(options);\n        new Runner(options.build()).run();\n    }\n}\n\nSample benchmarks\n\nNow, you can write your first benchmark:\n\nWithout any special setup\n\n@JmhBenchmark\npublic class JmhStateBenchmark {\n    public static class MyState extends JmhBenchmarkState {\n    }\n\n    @Benchmark\n    public void benchmark(MyState state) {\n        // benchmark code goes here\n        state.getJenkins().setSystemMessage(\"Hello world\");\n    }\n}\n\nUsing Configuration as Code\n\nTo use configuration as code, apart from the dependencies above you also need to add the following\nto your pom.xml :\n\nio.jenkins\nconfiguration-as-code\n1.21\ntrue\n\nio.jenkins\nconfiguration-as-code\n1.21\ntests\ntest\n\nNow configuring a benchmark is as simple as providing path to your YAML file and specifying the class\ncontaining the benchmark state.\n\n@JmhBenchmark\npublic class SampleBenchmark {\n    public static class MyState extends CascJmhBenchmarkState {\n        @NonNull\n        @Override\n        protected String getResourcePath() {\n            return \"config.yml\";\n        }\n\n        @NonNull\n        @Override\n        protected Class getEnclosingClass() {\n            return SampleBenchmark.class;\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Benchmark\n    public void benchmark(MyState state) {\n        Jenkins jenkins = state.getJenkins(); // jenkins is configured and ready to be benchmarked.\n        // your benchmark code goes here...\n    }\n}\n\nMore Samples\n\nAs a part of this project, a few benchmarks have been created in the Role Strategy Plugin which show\nconfiguring the instances for various situations. You can find them\nhere.\n\nRunning Benchmarks\n\nRunning benchmarks from Maven\n\nTo easily run benchmarks from Maven, a Maven profile to run the benchmarks has been created\nand is available starting Plugin-POM version 3.45. You can then run your benchmarks from the\ncommand line using mvn test -Dbenchmark.\n\nRunning benchmarks on ci.jenkins.io\n\nIf you have your plugins hosted on ci.jenkins.io, you can easily run benchmarks directly from your Jenkinsfile\nby using the runBenchmarks() method after the buildPlugin() step in your which is now available in\nJenkins Pipeline library.\nThis function also accepts the path to your generated JMH benchmark reports as an optional\nparameter and archives the benchmark results. Running benchmarks in pull request builds allows you to constantly\nmonitor the performance implications of a given change. For example, the Jenkinsfile from Role Strategy Plugin:\n\nbuildPlugin()\nrunBenchmarks('jmh-report.json')\n\nVisualizing benchmark results\n\nBenchmark reports generated (in JSON) can be visualized using the either the JMH Report Plugin\nor by passing the benchmark reports to the JMH visualizer web service. As an example, here is\na visualized report of some benchmarks from the Role Strategy Plugin:\n\nThese improvements seen above were obtained through a small pull request\nto the plugin and shows how even seemingly small changes can bring major performance improvements. Microbenchmarks\nhelp to find these hot-spots and estimate the impact of changes.\n\nSome tips and tricks\n\nSince BenchmarkRunner class name in the example above does not qualify as a test according to Maven surefire plugin’s\nnaming conventions, the benchmarks will not interfere with your JUnit tests.\n\nBenchmark methods need to be annotated by @Benchmark for JMH to detect them.\n\nClasses containing benchmarks are found automatically by the BenchmarkFinder\nwhen annotated with @JmhBenchmark.\n\nA reference to the Jenkins instance is available through either JmhBenchmarkState#getJenkins() or through\nJenkins.getInstance() like you would otherwise do.\n\nJmhBenchmarkState provides setup() and tearDown() methods which can be overridden to configure the\nJenkins instance according to your benchmark’s requirements.\n\nThe benchmark builds on ci.jenkins.io are currently throttled because of the limited availability of highmem nodes.\n\nThe benchmark framework was made available in Jenkins Test Harness 2.50, it is recommended to use version 2.51 as it includes some bug fixes.\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nIf you have any feedback, comments or questions, please feel free to reach out to me through either\nthe Role Strategy Plugin Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list.\n\nPresentation slides\n\nDemo at Platform SIG meeting\n\nDocumentation for the micro-benchmark framework:\n\nWriting benchmarks (Jenkins Test Harness)\n\nPreconfiguring benchmarks using JCasC\n\nRunning benchmarks using Plugin POM profile\n\nBuild Step for running benchmarks on ci.jenkins.io","title":"Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins","tags":["jmh","plugins","benchmark","performance","developer","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/ff5b9/abhyudayasharma.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/f4523/abhyudayasharma.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/1e7bb/abhyudayasharma.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/ff5b9/abhyudayasharma.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/b48b6/abhyudayasharma.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/1fd06/abhyudayasharma.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/9edd6/abhyudayasharma.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/f5f75/abhyudayasharma.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/05d06/abhyudayasharma.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":142}}},"blog":null,"github":"AbhyudayaSharma","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Abhyudaya is a Computer Science student at Shiv Nadar University, India.\nHe is participating in Google Summer of Code 2019 to improve the performance\nof the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin\">Role Strategy Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"abhyudayasharma","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Abhyudaya Sharma","slug":"/blog/authors/abhyudayasharma","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d85f9019-be6e-5fed-9a43-5cc4d0781ec3","slug":"/blog/2019/03/04/gsoc2019-announcement/","strippedHtml":"On behalf of the Jenkins GSoC org team,\nI am happy to announce that the Jenkins project has been accepted to\nGoogle Summer of Code 2019.\nThis year we invite students and mentors to join the Jenkins community and work together\non enhancing the Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nJust to provide some numbers, this is the biggest GSoC ever, 206 organizations will participate in GSoC this year.\nAnd it will be hopefully the biggest year for Jenkins as well.\nWe have 25 project ideas\nand more than 30 potential mentors (and counting!).\nIt is already more than in 2016 and 2018 combined.\nThere are many plugins, SIGs and sub-projects which have already joined GSoC this year.\nAnd we have already received messages and first contributions from dozens of students, yey!\n\nWhat’s next?\nGSoC is officially announced, and please expect more students to contact projects in our\nGitter channels and mailing lists.\nMany communications will also happen in SIG and sub-project channels.\nWe will be working hard in order to help students to find interesting projects, to explore the area,\nand to prepare their project proposals before the deadline on April 9th.\nThen we will process the applications, select projects and assign mentor teams.\n\nAll information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its sub-project page.\n\nI am a student.

be about anything around code: new features, plugins, test frameworks, infrastructure, etc., etc.\n\nMaking a project idea proposal is easy, you can read the instructions here.\nQuick start:\n\nCopy the project proposal template,\nadd a short description of your project idea\n\nOpen the document for public view and comments, reference communication channels there (if any)\n\nLet us know about the project idea via our gitter channel or the\nmailing list.\n\nAfter getting initial feedback from org admins, share your idea with other contributors who might be interested\n(via the developer mailing list, chats, or special interest groups)\n\nPotential mentors are invited to read the information for mentors for more information about the project.\nNote that being a GSoC mentor does not require expert knowledge of Jenkins.\nGSoC org admins will help to find technical advisors, so you can study together with your students.\n\nMentoring takes about 5 to 6 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).\nIn return, a student works on your project full time for four months.\nThink about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but could not find the time…​\nThere are also many opportunities to engage with the Jenkins community (meetups, knowledge sharing, communications) and with other projects (e.g. going to the GSoC Mentor Summit).\nGSoC is a pretty good return on the investment!\n\nFor any question, you can find the GSoC admins,\nmentors and participants on the GSoC SIG Gitter chat.\n\nThe Jenkins GSoC Org Admin Team 2019","title":"Google Summer of Code 2019.
