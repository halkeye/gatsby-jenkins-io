Since the first commit in 2006, the project has reached a\nnumber of significant milestones in its ten years but we have never experienced\nthe breadth of major milestones in such a short amount of time. From\nJenkins 2\nand\nBlue Ocean\nto the\nGoogle Summer of Code\nand\nJenkins World,\n\nI wanted to take a moment and celebrate the myriad of accomplishments which\ncouldn’t have happened without the help from everybody who participates in the\nJenkins project. The 1,300+ contributors to the\njenkinsci GitHub organization,\nthe 4,000+ members of the\ndevelopers mailing list,\nthe 8,000+ members of the\nusers mailing list,\nand countless others who have reported issues, submitted pull requests, and\npresented at meetups and conferences.\n\nJenkins 2\n\nThrough the course of 2016, the Jenkins project published 16\nLTS releases\nand 54\nWeekly releases.\nOf those 70 releases, the most notable may have been the\nJenkins 2.0 release\nwhich was published in April.\n\nJenkins 2 made Pipeline as Code front-and-center in the user experience,\nintroduced a new \"Getting Started\" experience, and included a number of other\nsmall UI improvements, all while maintaining backwards compatibility with\nexisting Jenkins environments.\n\nSince April, we have released a number of LTS\nreleases using Jenkins 2 as a baseline, meaning the Jenkins project no longer\nmaintains any 1.x release lines.\n\nThe\nPipeline\nefforts have continuted to gain steam since April, covered on this blog with a\nnumber of\nposts tagged \"pipeline\". Closing out 2016 with the\nannouncement of the beta for\nDeclarative Pipeline syntax\nwhich is expected in early 2017.\n\nBlue Ocean\n\nHot on the heels of Jenkins 2 announcement\"Blue Ocean, a new user experience for Jenkins\",\nwas\nopen sourced in May.\nBlue Ocean is a new project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins.\nDesigned from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline and compatible with Freestyle\njobs. The goal for the project is to reduce clutter and increase clarity for\nevery member of a team using Jenkins.\n\nThe Blue Ocean beta can be installed from the Update Center and can be run in\nproduction Jenkins environments alongside the existing UI. It adds the new user experience under\n/blue in the environment but does not disturb the existing UI.\n\nBlue Ocean is expected to reach \"1.0\" in the first half of 2017.\n\nAzure\n\nAlso in May of 2016, the Jenkins project announced an exciting\nPartnership with Microsoft\nto run our project infrastructure on\nAzure. While the migration of Jenkins project\ninfrastructure into Azure is still on-going, there have been some notable\nmilestones reached already:\n\nEnd-to-end TLS encrypted delivery for Debian/openSUSE/Red Hat repositories which are\nconfigured to use https://pkg.jenkins.io by the end-user.\n\nMajor capacity improvements to\nci.jenkins.io\nproviding on-demand Ubuntu and Windows build/test infrastructure.\n\nA full continuous delivery Pipeline for all Azure-based infrastructure using\nTerraform from Jenkins.\n\nThe migration to Azure is expected to complete in 2017.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nFor the first time in the history of the project, Jenkins was accepted into\nGoogle Summer of Code\n2016. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual, international, program\nwhich encourages college-aged students to participate with open source projects\nduring the summer break between classes. Students accepted into the program\nreceive a stipend, paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or\nenhance the Jenkins project.\n\nIn exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteered as \"mentors\" for\nstudents to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed in\ncompleting their summer projects.\n\nA lot was learned during the summer which we look forward to applying to Google\nSummer of Code 2017\n\nJenkins World\n\nIn September, over one thousand people attended\nJenkins World,\nin Santa Clara, California.\n\nFollowing the event,\nLiam\nposted a series of blog posts which highlight some of the fantastic content\nshared by Jenkins users and contributors from around the world, such as:\n\nThe demos from the \"Experts\"\n\nSessions on Scaling Jenkins\n\nUsing Jenkins Pipeline\n\nThe Contributor Summit\n\nJenkins World was the first global event of its kind for Jenkins, it brought users\nand contributors together to exchange ideas on the current state of the\nproject, celebrate accomplishments of the past year, and look ahead at all the\nexiting enhancements coming down the pipe(line).\n\nIt was such a smashing success that\nJenkins World 2017\nis already scheduled for August 30-31st in San Francisco, California.\n\nJAM\n\nFinally, 2016 saw tremendous growth in the number of\nJenkins Area Meetups\n(JAMs) hosted around the world. JAMs are local meetups intended to bring\nJenkins users and contributors together for socializing and learning. JAMs are\norganized by local Jenkins community members who have a passion for sharing new\nJenkins concepts, patterns and tools.\n\nDriven by current Jenkins Events Officer,\nAlyssa Tong,\nand the dozens of passionate organizers, JAMs have become a great way to meet\nother Jenkins users near you.\n\nWhile we don’t yet have JAMs on each of the seven continents, you can always join the\nJenkins Online Meetup.\nThough we’re hoping more groups will be founded near you in 2017!\n\nI am personally grateful for the variety and volume of contributions made by\nthousands of people to the Jenkins project this year. I believe I can speak for\nproject founder,\nKohsuke Kawaguchi,\nin stating that the Jenkins community has grown beyond our anything we could\nhave imagined five years ago, let alone ten!\n\nThere are number of ways to\nparticipate\nin the Jenkins project, so if you didn’t have an opportunity to join in during\n2016, we hope to see you next year!","title":"Thank you for an amazing 2016","tags":["jam","jenkins2","pipeline","blueocean","azure","gsoc","new-year-blogpost"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

blog post is a continuation of the External Workspace Manager Plugin related posts, starting with\nthe introductory blog post, and followed by\nthe alpha version release announcement.\n\nAs the title suggests, the beta version of the External Workspace Manager Plugin was launched!\nThis means that it’s available only in the\nExperimental Plugins Update Center.\n\nTake care when installing plugins from the Experimental Update Center, since they may change in\nbackward-incompatible ways.\nIt’s advisable not to use it for Jenkins production environments.\n\nThe plugin’s repository is on GitHub.\nThe complete plugin’s documentation can be accessed\nhere.\n\nWhat’s new\n\nBellow is a summary of the features added so far, since the alpha version.\n\nMultiple upstream run selection strategies\n\nIt has support for the\nRun Selector Plugin (which is still in beta),\nso you can provide different run selection strategies when allocating a disk from the upstream job.\n\nLet’s suppose that we have an upstream job that clones the repository and builds the project:\n\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate 'diskpool1'\n\nnode ('linux') {\n    exws (extWorkspace) {\n        checkout scm\n        sh 'mvn clean install -DskipTests'\n    }\n}\n\nIn the downstream job, we run the tests on a different node, but we reuse the same workspace as the previous job:\n\ndef run = selectRun 'upstream'\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate selectedRun: run\n\nnode ('test') {\n    exws (extWorkspace) {\n        sh 'mvn test'\n    }\n}\n\nThe selectRun in this example selects the last stable build from the upstream job.\nBut, we can be more explicit, and select a specific build number from the upstream job.\n\ndef run = selectRun 'upstream',\n selector: [$class: 'SpecificRunSelector', buildNumber: UPSTREAM_BUILD_NUMBER]\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate selectedRun: run\n// ...\n\nWhen the selectedRun parameter is given to the exwsAllocate step, it will allocate the same workspace that was\nused by that run.\n\nThe Run Selector Plugin has several run selection strategies that are briefly explained\nhere.\n\nAutomatic workspace cleanup\n\nProvides an automatic workspace cleanup by integrating the\nWorkspace Cleanup Plugin.\nFor example, if we need to delete the workspace only if the build has failed, we can do the following:\n\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate diskPoolId: 'diskpool1'\n\nnode ('linux') {\n    exws (extWorkspace) {\n        try {\n            checkout scm\n            sh 'mvn clean install'\n        } catch (e) {\n            currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'\n            throw e\n        } finally {\n            step ([$class: 'WsCleanup', cleanWhenFailure: false])\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nMore workspace cleanup examples can be found at this\nlink.\n\nCustom workspace path\n\nAllows the user to specify a custom workspace path to be used when allocating workspace on the disk.\nThe plugin offers two alternatives for doing this:\n\nby defining a global workspace template for each Disk Pool\n\nThis can be defined in the Jenkins global config, External Workspace Definitions section.\n\nby defining a custom workspace path in the Pipeline script\n\nWe can use the Pipeline DSL to compute the workspace path.\nThen we pass this path as input parameter to the exwsAllocate step.\n\ndef customPath = \"${env.JOB_NAME}/${PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER}/${env.BUILD_NUMBER}\"\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate diskPoolId: 'diskpool1', path: customPath\n// ...\n\nFor more details see the afferent\ndocumentation page.\n\nDisk Pool restrictions\n\nThe plugin comes with Disk Pool restriction strategies.\nIt does this by using the restriction capabilities provided by the\nJob Restrictions Plugin.\n\nFor example, we can restrict a Disk Pool to be allocated only if the Jenkins job in which it’s allocated was triggered\nby a specific user:\n\nOr, we can restrict the Disk Pool to be allocated only for those jobs whose name matches a well defined pattern:\n\nWhat’s next\n\nCurrently there is ongoing work for providing flexible disk allocation strategies.\nThe user will be able to define a default disk allocation strategy in the Jenkins global config.\nSo for example, we want to select the disk with the most usable space as default allocation strategy:\n\nIf needed, this allocation strategy may be overridden in the Pipeline code.\nLet’s suppose that for a specific job, we want to allocate the disk with the highest read speed.\n\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate diskPoolId: 'diskpool1', strategy: fastestRead()\n// ...\n\nWhen this feature is completed, the plugin will enter a final testing phase.\nIf all goes to plan, a stable version should be released in about two weeks.\n\nIf you have any issues in setting up or using the plugin, please feel free to ask me on the plugin’s Gitter\nchat.\nAny feedback is welcome, and you may provide it either on the Gitter chat, or on\nJira by using the external-workspace-manager-plugin component.\n\nLinks\n\nProject repository\n\nProject intro blog post\n\nAlpha version announcement\n\nGSoC page\n\nJenkins GSoC Page","title":"GSoC: External
