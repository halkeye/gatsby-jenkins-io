The governance board has also met and there will be more information coming regarding removal of offensive terminology.\nLast week we took another step towards removing offensive terminology within the project by updating previous blog posts and removing offensive terminology in old blogs, cleaning up some references in Jenkins built-in documetation and localization, etc.\nThe meeting minutes are available here and a recording of the meeting here\nThere is more work to do. The core team is working to address terms such as \"Master\", \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" as well addressing git branching terminology.\n\nWe could use your help\nWe continue to do this much needed work and would like to remind everyone that the Jenkins project is governed by the Code of Conduct.\n\nSincerely,\nMarky Jackson","title":"On Jenkins Terminology Updates","tags":["community","opensource","governance","documentation"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b5d641eb-bed7-5caf-9805-42a1970f13d1","slug":"/blog/2020/03/02/pipeline-authoring-sig-update/","strippedHtml":"What is the Pipeline-Authoring Special Interest Group\n\nThis special interest group aims to improve and curate the experience of authoring Jenkins Pipelines. This includes the\nsyntax of `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries, code sharing and reuse, testing of Pipelines and shared libraries, IDE\nintegration and other development tools, documentation, best practices, and examples.\n\nWhat Are The Focus Areas of the Pipeline-Authoring Special Interest Group\n\nSyntax - How `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries are written.\n\nCode sharing and reuse - Shared libraries and future improvements.\n\nTesting - Unit and functional testing of `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries.\n\nIDE integration, editors, and other development tools - IDE plugins, visual editors, etc.\n\nDocumentation - Reference documentation, tutorials, and more.\n\nBest practices - Defining, maintaining, and evangelizing best practices in Jenkins Pipeline.\n\nExamples - Real-world `Jenkinsfile`s and shared libraries demonstrating how to utilize various features of Pipeline,\nas well as basic or starter `Jenkinsfile`s for common patterns that can be used as jumping-off points by new users.\n\nWhat Have We Been Up To\n\nWith the start of a new year, members got together to discuss the roadmap for 2020. During the initial discussions we\ndetermined that it would be good to examine the goals of previous meetings and determine the best path forward.\n\nA mutual decision was made that to better create a roadmap; we needed to understand better who we were aiming to help.\nWe decided that creating personas was very beneficial. Personas are fictional characters, which we are creating based\nupon our research to represent the different user types that might use Jenkins pipelines.\nCreating personas can help us step out of ourselves. It can help us to recognize that different people have different\nneeds and expectations, and it can also help us to identify with the user we are building the roadmap for. Personas make\nthe task at hand less complicated, they guide our ideation processes, and they can help us to achieve the goal of\ncreating a good user experience for our target user group.\nA lot of that work can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdyzJwt50Wk3uUNsLMl2d4w2MGYss-phqet0s-KjbEs/edit\nThe idea is to map the personas to a maturity model and then map the maturity model to the actual documentation. That\nmaturity model can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ByzWlPU0j1qM_gqspJppkNKkR5ZVLWlB/view\n\nHow Can I Get Involved\n\nWe have been meeting regularly to define personas to help us better create the SIG roadmap. We meet twice a week,\nonce on Thursday for the EMEA timezone and once on Friday for the US timezone. Meeting notes can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1EhWoBplGl4M8bHz0uuP-iOynPGuONjcz4enQm8sDyUE/edit# and the calendar, if you would\nlike to attend, is here: https://jenkins.io/event-calendar/. The previous recording of the meetings are\nlocated here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz_kPpb9C1w&list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOKKLBXek6iG8wTS24Ac7Y3\n\nNext Steps\n\nWe have a lot of work to do and could use your help. If you would love to join us, check out the meeting link. If you\nwould like to check out the personas and give feedback, also check out the link.\nOnce we have wrapped up the personas work, we will start to identify the available documentation and ensure we have\nadequate documentation with the help of the Doc SIG.\nWe will finally then start working to build out tools to help the community with pipelines in Jenkins better.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you would like to get in touch with the Pipeline-Authoring SIG, you can by joining the\nPipeline-Authoring SIG gitter channel or via the\nPipeline-Authoring SIG mailing list","title":"Pipeline-Authoring SIG Update","tags":["Pipeline-Authoring","SIG","community","opensource"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d12bee04-3e3b-5a23-9775-d800d9abf794","slug":"/blog/2019/08/25/jenkinsworld-contrib-summit-ask-the-expert-booth/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins turns 15 years old!\nJenkins World brings together DevOps thought leaders, IT executives, continuous delivery practitioners and the Jenkins\ncommunity and ecosystem in one global event, providing attendees with the opportunity to learn, explore, network\nface-to-face and help shape the next evolution of Jenkins development and solutions for DevOps.\n\nThere is also the Jenkins Contributor Summit in San Francisco. The Jenkins Contributor Summit is the place where\ncurrent and future contributors get together to discuss, learn and collaborate on the latest and greatest efforts within\nJenkins project. The morning portion of the summit is a mix of presentations by the core contributors. The\npresentations highlight what each effort is about and what community members can do to help. In the\nafternoon breakout sessions with  Birds of a Feather tables for in-depth discussion, and collaboration with sub-project\ncontributors.\n\nI feel very honored to have been a part of this.\n\nDay 1\n\nDay one started with the contributor summit. This was a chance for everyone to get together and talk about\ncontributions and put faces to names. Most people I had only met via video chat or on gitter so I was super excited.\nWe gathered to hear about the start of the Jenkins open source landscape.\n\nNext up was the BoF/Unconference. I was leading these sessions and I felt they went really well.\nWe had fellow org admins Martin d’Anjou and Jeff Pearce give a talk about Google Summer of Code projects.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code student Natasha Stopa presented her project, Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool. This is\na super cool project and very well received in the community.\n\nWe closed out the session with a presentation from Steven Terrana from Booz Allen Hamilton and the awesome Jenkins\nTemplating Engine. If you have not had a chance to try this, please make sure you do at https://github.com/boozallen/jenkins-templating-engine.\n\nMain Expo Hall\n\nDay two and onward saw me and other Jenkins org admins in the Ask the Expert booth for the Jenkins community.\n\nThis was a really cool experience and gave me a chance to hear about things the community is working on and help with\nissues they are facing.\nThere were a range of questions from Jenkins X to many of the plugins I maintain such and the Jenkins Prometheus and the\nSysdig Secure Scanning plugins.\nThere were also a lot of Kubernetes questions. There is a lot of marketing data regarding the increased usage of\nKubernetes but I was seriously surprised by the massive interest in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nOf course there were opportunities for selfie requests.\n\nLunch time demos got underway and we had a busy schedule.\nFirst up was the awesome Mark Waite to talk about the\nGit plugin. A lot of people use git in\nJenkins.\nThank you so much for all that you do Mark.\n\nJenkins org admin Martin d’Anjou was next on deck to talk about the Google Summer of Code. So amazing to think that the\nGoogle Summer of Code is also in its 15th year like Jenkins!\n\nNatasha Stopa is a Google Summer of Code student and she presented her project Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool.\nNatasha really put a lot of hard work in to this plugin and it was really awesome to see the turn out and support during\nher presentation.\n\nFinally there was me. I presented the Sysdig Secure Scanning Jenkins plugin which I am a maintainer of. I thank everyone who attended\n\nRight after the lunch time demos I also oversaw the Jenkins open space. This was an opportunity for the community to talk\nabout items and let them flow organically. I really enjoyed this session and felt it was also well received.\n\nWe closed out the day and the event with a picture of some of the Jenkins org admins and Google Summer of Code students.\nMissing from this photos are fellow org admins, Lloyd Chang and Oleg Nenashev\n\nClosing\n\nThis was an amazing experience. Huge thanks to CloudBees, the Jenkins community, Google Summer of Code, Tracy Miranda,\nAlyssa Tong and my employer Sysdig.\n\nTo think Jenkins is 15 years old is amazing! There has been so much accomplished and the future is so bright. I am so\nthankful for the opportunity to serve and be a part of the open source community.\nHere’s to 15 more years all!\n\nIf you are interested in joining any one of the Jenkins open source special interest groups, look here.
