As I write this it is about 1000 degrees outside.\nEmergency measures such as air-conditioning and beer have been deployed in\norder to continue Blue Ocean development.\n\nThis week featured a new beta with the\nSCM API\nchanges; many bug fixes, and some version bumps went out in beta 22.

Whether creating, editing or reviewing\na pipeline, having a straightforward structure helps to understand and predict the\nflow of the pipeline and provides a common foundation across all pipelines.\n\nPipeline as Code\n\nPipeline as Code was one of the pillars of the Jenkins 2.0 release and an\nessential part of implementing continuous delivery (CD). Defining all of the\nstages of an application’s CD pipeline within a Jenkinsfile and checking it\ninto the repository with the application code provides all of the benefits\ninherent in source control management (SCM):\n\nRetain history of all changes to Pipeline\n\nRollback to a previous Pipeline version\n\nView diffs and merge changes to the Pipeline\n\nTest new Pipeline steps in branches\n\nRun the same Pipeline on a different Jenkins server\n\nGetting Started with Declarative Pipeline\n\nWe recommend people begin using it for all their Pipeline definitions in Jenkins.\nThe plugin has been available for use and testing starting with the 0.1 release that was debuted at\nJenkins World\nin September. Since then, it has already been installed in over 5,000 Jenkins\nenvironments.\n\nIf you haven’t tried Pipeline or have considered Pipeline in the past, I\nbelieve this new syntax is much more approachable with an easier adoption curve\nto quickly realize all of the benefits of Pipeline as Code. In addition, the\npre-defined structure of Declarative makes it possible to create and edit\nPipelines with a graphical user interface (GUI). The Blue Ocean team is\nactively working on a\nVisual Pipeline Editor\nwhich will be included in an upcoming release.\n\nIf you have already begun using Pipelines in Jenkins, I believe that this new\nalternative syntax can help expand that usage.\n\nThe original syntax for defining Pipelines in Jenkins is a Groovy DSL that\nallows most of the features of full\nimperative programming.\n\nThis syntax is still fully supported and is now\nreferred to as \"Scripted Pipeline Syntax\" to distinguish it from \"Declarative\nPipeline Syntax.\" Both use the same underlying execution engine in Jenkins and\nboth will generate the same results in\nPipeline Stage View\nor Blue Ocean visualizations. All existing\nPipeline steps,\nGlobal Variables, and\nShared Libraries\ncan be used in either. You can now create more cookie-cutter Pipelines and\nextend the power of Pipeline to all users regardless of Groovy expertise.\n\nDeclarative Pipeline Features\n\nSyntax Checking\n\nImmediate runtime syntax checking with explicit error messages.\n\nAPI endpoint for linting a Jenkinsfile.\n\nCLI command to lint a Jenkinsfile.\n\nDocker Pipeline integration\n\nRun all stages in a single container.\n\nRun each stage in a different container.\n\nEasy configuration\n\nQuickly define parameters for your Pipeline.\n\nQuickly define environment variables and credentials for your Pipeline.\n\nQuickly define options (such as timeout, retry, build discarding) for your Pipeline.\n\nRound trip editing with the Visual Pipeline Editor (watch for preview release shortly).\n\nConditional actions\n\nSend notifications or take actions depending upon success or failure.\n\nSkip stages based on branches, environment, or other Boolean expression.\nrelease shortly)\n\nWhere Can I Learn More?\n\nBe on the lookout for future blog posts detailing specific examples of\nscenarios or features in Declarative Pipeline. Andrew Bayer, one of the primary\ndevelopers behind Declarative Pipeline, will be presenting at\nFOSDEM\nin Brussels, Belgium this weekend. We have also scheduled an online\nJenkins Meetup (JAM)\nlater this month to demo the features of Declarative Pipeline and give a sneak\npeek at the upcoming Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor.\n\nIn the meantime, all the\nPipeline documentation\nhas been updated to incorporate a\nGuided Tour,\nand a\nSyntax Reference\nwith numerous examples to help you get on your way to using Pipeline.  Simply\nupgrade to the latest version, 2.5 or later of the Pipeline in Jenkins to\nenable all of these great features.","title":"Declarative Pipeline Syntax 1.0 is now available","tags":["pipeline","blueocean"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":"47fad7c8-e5e2-5ee5-bca8-79356edc804b","slug":"/blog/2017/01/27/blueocean-dev-log-jan4/","strippedHtml":"As we get closer to\nBlue Ocean\n1.0, which is planned for the end of March, I have\nstarted\nhighlighting\nsome of the good stuff that has been going on. This week was 10 steps forward, and about 1.5 backwards…​\n\nThere were two releases this week, b19 and b20. Unfortunately, b20 had to\nbe released shortly after b19 hit the Update Center as an incompatible API\nchange in a 3rd party plugin was discovered.\n\nRegardless, the latest b20 has a lot of important improvements, and some\nvery nice new features.\n\nA first cut of the \"Create Pipeline\" UX, seen above, allowing you to create Git\nbased Multibranch Pipelines like you have never seen before.\n\nHandling network disconnections from the browser to server (eg server\nrestart, network etc) gracefully with a nice UI.\n\nMore precise time information for steps and running Pipelines.\n\nMore information when a Pipeline is blocked on infrastructure, such as when\nthe Pipeline is waiting for an agent to become available.\n\nFixed a really embarrassing typo (a prize if you spot it).\n\nTest reports now include stdout and stderr\n\nBetter support for parallel visualisation, such as when a parallel step exists outside of a stage.\n\nThe Visual Editor also had another release, with the \"sheets\" visual component\nand better validation.\n\nCreation\n\nCurrently this is hidden behind a\nfeature toggle,\nto access append?blueCreate to the URL in you browser, and then press the\n\"New Pipeline\" button. Currently it lets you quickly create a Pipeline from\nGit, add credentials, etc, in a very nice UX. More SCM types are being added to\nsupport this.\n\nReconnect/disconnect\n\nAs Blue Ocean is a very \"live\" style of UX, if your network becomes\nunavailable, or the server is restarted, it is good to know in case you\nwere staring at the screen waiting for something to happen (don’t you have\nanything better to do??). When this happens, now you get a polite message,\nand then when the connection is restored, even if you are waiting for a\nPipeline run to finish, it will then notice this, and refresh things for\nyou:\n\nNote the opacity changes to make it clear even if you don’t see the little\nmessage. Very nice addition for those of us who work on a train far to often.\n\nUp next\n\nWhat is up next:\n\nSCM Api changes should land, making things much better for users of\nGitHub, Bitbucket, and many more.\n\nCreating Pipelines from GitHub (including automatic discovery).\n\nLots of fixes and enhancements in the Pipeline from all over the place\n\nMore ATH [ 1 ] coverage against regressions\n\nMore Visual Editor releases as Declarative Pipeline reaches version 1.0\n\nImprovements to i18n\n\nThere was also a couple of \"alternative beta\" releases in the \"Experimental\nUpdate Center\" to help test the new SCM API improvements for better use of\nGitHub APIs (based on\nthis branch)\nI do not recommend trying this branch unless you know what you are doing,\nas this will migrate some data, but help testing it would be appreciated!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nIf you’re interested in helping to make Blue Ocean a great user experience for\nJenkins, please join the Blue Ocean development team on\nGitter!\n\n1.

Since the first commit in 2006, the project has reached a\nnumber of significant milestones in its ten years but we have never experienced\nthe breadth of major milestones in such a short amount of time. From\nJenkins 2\nand\nBlue Ocean\nto the\nGoogle Summer of Code\nand\nJenkins World,\n\nI wanted to take a moment and celebrate the myriad of accomplishments which\ncouldn’t have happened without the help from everybody who participates in the\nJenkins project. The 1,300+ contributors to the\njenkinsci GitHub organization,\nthe 4,000+ members of the\ndevelopers mailing list,\nthe 8,000+ members of the\nusers mailing list,\nand countless others who have reported issues, submitted pull requests, and\npresented at meetups and conferences.\n\nJenkins 2\n\nThrough the course of 2016, the Jenkins project published 16\nLTS releases\nand 54\nWeekly releases.\nOf those 70 releases, the most notable may have been the\nJenkins 2.0 release\nwhich was published in April.\n\nJenkins 2 made Pipeline as Code front-and-center in the user experience,\nintroduced a new \"Getting Started\" experience, and included a number of other\nsmall UI improvements, all while maintaining backwards compatibility with\nexisting Jenkins environments.\n\nSince April, we have released a number of LTS\nreleases using Jenkins 2 as a baseline, meaning the Jenkins project no longer\nmaintains any 1.x release lines.\n\nThe\nPipeline\nefforts have continuted to gain steam since April, covered on this blog with a\nnumber of\nposts tagged \"pipeline\". Closing out 2016 with the\nannouncement of the beta for\nDeclarative Pipeline syntax\nwhich is expected in early 2017.\n\nBlue Ocean\n\nHot on the heels of Jenkins 2 announcement\"Blue Ocean, a new user experience for Jenkins\",\nwas\nopen sourced in May.\nBlue Ocean is a new project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins.\nDesigned from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline and compatible with Freestyle\njobs. The goal for the project is to reduce clutter and increase clarity for\nevery member of a team using Jenkins.\n\nThe Blue Ocean beta can be installed from the Update Center and can be run in\nproduction Jenkins environments alongside the existing UI. It adds the new user experience under\n/blue in the environment but does not disturb the existing UI.\n\nBlue Ocean is expected to reach \"1.0\" in the first half of 2017.\n\nAzure\n\nAlso in May of 2016, the Jenkins project announced an exciting\nPartnership with Microsoft\nto run our project infrastructure on\nAzure. While the migration of Jenkins project\ninfrastructure into Azure is still on-going, there have been some notable\nmilestones reached already:\n\nEnd-to-end TLS encrypted delivery for Debian/openSUSE/Red Hat repositories which are\nconfigured to use https://pkg.jenkins.io by the end-user.\n\nMajor capacity improvements to\nci.jenkins.io\nproviding on-demand Ubuntu and Windows build/test infrastructure.\n\nA full continuous delivery Pipeline for all Azure-based infrastructure using\nTerraform from Jenkins.\n\nThe migration to Azure is expected to complete in 2017.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nFor the first time in the history of the project, Jenkins was accepted into\nGoogle Summer of Code\n2016. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual, international, program\nwhich encourages college-aged students to participate with open source projects\nduring the summer break between classes. Students accepted into the program\nreceive a stipend, paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or\nenhance the Jenkins project.\n\nIn exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteered as \"mentors\" for\nstudents to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed in\ncompleting their summer projects.\n\nA lot was learned during the summer which we look forward to applying to Google\nSummer of Code 2017\n\nJenkins World\n\nIn September, over one thousand people attended\nJenkins World,\nin Santa Clara, California.\n\nFollowing the event,\nLiam\nposted a series of blog posts which highlight some of the fantastic content\nshared by Jenkins users and contributors from around the world, such as:\n\nThe demos from the \"Experts\"\n\nSessions on Scaling Jenkins\n\nUsing Jenkins Pipeline\n\nThe Contributor Summit\n\nJenkins World was the first global event of its kind for Jenkins, it brought users\nand contributors together to exchange ideas on the current state of the\nproject, celebrate accomplishments of the past year, and look ahead at all the\nexiting enhancements coming down the pipe(line).\n\nIt was such a smashing success that\nJenkins World 2017\nis already scheduled for August 30-31st in San Francisco, California.\n\nJAM\n\nFinally, 2016 saw tremendous growth in the number of\nJenkins Area Meetups\n(JAMs) hosted around the world. JAMs are local meetups intended to bring\nJenkins users and contributors together for socializing and learning. JAMs are\norganized by local Jenkins community members who have a passion for sharing new\nJenkins concepts, patterns and tools.\n\nDriven by current Jenkins Events Officer,\nAlyssa Tong,\nand the dozens of passionate organizers, JAMs have become a great way to meet\nother Jenkins users near you.\n\nWhile we don’t yet have JAMs on each of the seven continents, you can always join the\nJenkins Online Meetup.\nThough we’re hoping more groups will be founded near you in 2017!\n\nI am personally grateful for the variety and volume of contributions made by\nthousands of people to the Jenkins project this year.

Although it has been available in the update center\nsince August,\nwe continue to solidify the syntax. We feel this release is getting\nvery close to the final version and should not change much before 1.0. However,\nit is still a Beta so further tweaks are possible.\n\nA release (0.8.0) is planned for early January 2017 which will finalize the\nsyntax with the following changes:\nJENKINS-40524,\nJENKINS-40370,\nJENKINS-40462,\nJENKINS-40337\n\nWhat is Declarative Pipeline?\n\nAll the way back at Jenkins World in September, Andrew Bayer presented a\nsneak peak\nof a new syntax for constructing Pipelines. We are calling this new syntax\nDeclarative Pipeline to differentiate it from the existing Scripted Pipeline\nsyntax that has always been a part of Pipeline.\n\nAfter listening to many Jenkins users over the last year we felt that, while\nPipeline Script provides tremendous power, flexibility, and extensibility, the\nlearning curve for Scripted Pipeline was steep for users new to either Jenkins\nor Pipeline. Beginning users wanting to take advantage of all the features\nprovided by Pipeline and Jenkinsfiles were required to learn Scripted Pipeline\nor remain limited to the functionality provided by Freestyle jobs.\n\nDeclarative Pipeline does not replace Scripted Pipeline but extends Pipeline it\nwith a pre-defined structure to let users focus entirely on the steps\nrequired at each stage without needing to worry about scripting every aspect\nof the pipeline. Granular flow-control is extremely powerful and Scripted\nPipeline syntax will always be part of Pipeline but it’s not for everyone.\n\nDeclarative Pipeline enables all users to connect simple, declarative blocks\nthat define agents (including Docker), post actions, environment\nsettings, credentials and all stages that make up the pipeline. Best of all,\nbecause this Declarative syntax is part of Pipeline, all build steps and build\nwrappers available in Plugins or loaded from Shared Libraries are also\navailable as steps in Declarative.\n\nExample\n\nBelow is an example of a pipeline in Declarative syntax. You can also switch the view to show the same pipeline in Scripted syntax.\n The Declarative syntax has a more straightforward structure that is easier to grok by users not versed in Groovy.\n\n// Declarative //\npipeline {\n  agent  label:'has-docker', dockerfile: true\n  environment {\n    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME = \"jenkins\"\n    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL = \"jenkins@jenkins.io\"\n  }\n  stages {\n    stage(\"Build\") {\n      steps {\n        sh 'mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true'\n      }\n    }\n    stage(\"Archive\"){\n      steps {\n        archive \"*/target/**/*\"\n        junit '*/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  post {\n    always {\n      deleteDir()\n    }\n    success {\n      mail to:\"me@example.com\", subject:\"SUCCESS: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}\", body: \"Yay, we passed.\"\n    }\n    failure {\n      mail to:\"me@example.com\", subject:\"FAILURE: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}\", body: \"Boo, we failed.\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Script //\nwithEnv([\"GIT_COMMITTER_NAME = jenkins\",\"GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL = jenkins@jenkins.io\"]) {\n  node('has-docker') {\n    try {\n      checkout scm // checks out Dockerfile and source code\n      def myImage = docker.build 'my-environment:snapshot'\n      myImage.inside {\n        stage('Build') {\n          sh 'mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true'\n        }\n        stage('Archive') {\n          archive \"*/target/**/*\"\n          junit '*/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'\n        }\n      }\n      if (currentBuild.result == null || currentBuild.result == 'SUCCESS') {\n        mail to:\"me@example.com\", subject:\"SUCCESS: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}\", body: \"Yay, we passed.\"\n      }\n    }\n    catch (exc) {\n      mail to:\"me@example.com\", subject:\"FAILURE: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}\", body: \"Boo, we failed.\"\n    }\n    finally {\n      deleteDir()\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHow can you help?\n\nInstall the lastest version of the\nPipeline-Model-Defintion plugin.\n\nRead the documentation:\nGetting Started and\nSyntax overview.\n(These documents will be incorporated into the Jenkins.io documentation.)\n\nConvert some of your existing Pipeline scripts into Declarative\n\nLog any issues or enhancements you have\nhere\nfor the syntax, the execution, or the documentation.\n\nAsk questions. You can send questions to the\nusers mailing list\nor visit the #jenkins channel on IRC.\n\nHow will this work with Blue Ocean?\n\nBlue Ocean is all about Pipelines in Jenkins. Running, displaying, and soon,\ncreating Pipelines.  Blue Ocean will be able to run and display Pipelines\nwritten in this new syntax just like any other Pipeline works today. However,\nbecause Declarative Pipeline includes a pre-defined structure, or model, it is\nnow possible to create and edit pipelines with a GUI editor.\n\nAlthough we plan to launch 1.0 of Declarative Pipeline before Blue Ocean 1.0 is\nofficially available, we expect to have a working Beta of the Editor available\nto play with. The combination of a simple syntax and an intuitive editor\nshould make creating Jenkins Pipelines a breeze.\n\nHappy Holidays\n\nI hope everyone has a great end of the year and a Happy New Year. With\nDeclarative Pipeline and\nBlue Ocean\nwe expect great things for Jenkins in 2017!","title":"Announcing the beta of Declarative Pipeline Syntax","tags":["pipeline","blueocean"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"blueocean","limit":8,"skip":16,"numPages":4,"currentPage":3}},
