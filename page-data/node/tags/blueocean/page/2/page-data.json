Easily installed as a plugin for Jenkins and integrated\nwith Jenkins Pipeline, it is available from today for production use.\n\nSince the start of the beta at Jenkins World 2016 in September there are now\nover 7400+ installations making use of Blue Ocean. This wouldn‚Äôt be possible\nwithout the support of the entire Jenkins developer and\nuser community - so thank you for your support!\n\nBlue Ocean is available today from the update center and also as a\nDocker image - why not give it a try?\n\nVisual Pipeline Editing - Team members of any skill level can create continuous\ndelivery pipelines from start to finish, with just several clicks, using the\nintuitive, visual pipeline editor. Any pipeline created with the visual editor\ncan also be edited in your favorite text editor\nbringing all the benefits of Pipeline as Code.\n\nPipeline Visualization - Developers can visually represent pipelines in a way\nthat anyone on the team can understand - even your boss‚Äôs boss - improving\nclarity into the continuous delivery process for the whole organization.\nThe visualization helps you focus on what the pipeline does, not how it does it.\n\nPinpoint Troubleshooting - Blue Ocean enables developers to locate automation\nproblems instantly, without endlessly scanning through logs or navigating\nthrough many screens, so you can get back to building the next big thing.\n\nGitHub and Git Integration - Pipelines are created for all feature branches\nand pull requests, with their status reported back to GitHub.\nThe whole team has visibility into whether changes need work or are good to go.\n\nPersonalization ‚Äì Every team member can make Jenkins their own by customizing\nthe dashboard so that they only see those pipelines that matter to them.\nFavoriting any pipeline or branch in Blue Ocean will show a favourite card on\nthe dashboard so you can see its status at a glance.\n\nJust one more thing ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to pay special thanks to:\n\nThe Core team ‚Äì to Keith Zantow, Thorsten Scherler, Tom Fennelly,\nIvan Meredith, Josh McDonald, Vivek Pandey, Brody Maclean and Cliff Meyers.\nEach of and everyone of you have brought your own passion, expertise and flair\nto the project ‚Äì and it shows. It‚Äôs been crazy fun and I hope working on\nBlue Ocean is something you look back on fondly.\n\nJenkins Developers past and present ‚Äì we recognise that we are standing on\nthe shoulders of giants and none of this wouldn‚Äôt be possible without your\nhard work and dedication to free & open source software and Jenkins.\nHere‚Äôs to the next 10 years üçª !\n\nCloudBees ‚Äì in particular, Sacha Labourey (CEO), Harpreet Singh\n(VP of Product) and Spike Washburn (VP of Engineering) whose dedication to\nJenkins, Open Source and continued faith in the vision and team made all of\nthis possible, and of course Bob Bickel (Advisor) who dared us to dream big.\n\nMichael Neale ‚Äì who drank all the kool-aide and is just as obsessed with\nand dedicated to Blue Ocean as I am. This project would never have shipped\nwithout his hand steady at the tiller. I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better friend\nand partner-in-crime.\n\nTyler Croy ‚Äì for guiding the project and myself on how to do open source\nThe Right Way‚Ñ¢. Tyler works tirelessly behind the scenes to to make Jenkins\nawesome and it wouldn‚Äôt be possible to keep this show running without\nhis help and sage-like advice.\n\nKohsuke Kawaguchi ‚Äì For creating Jenkins, getting Blue Ocean off of\nthe ground, his tour of Tokyo and above all, his trust.\n\nJenkins Users ‚Äì your enthusiasm for better development tools which\nkept our spirits and momentum up when the days grew long and things\nlooked tough. We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better, more appreciative or\npassionate group of people. Hopefully we‚Äôve done our job and you can get\nback to building your next big thing!\n\nNext stop, some well needed rest & recovery then back to to making\nJenkins one of the experiences for software developers worldwide!\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in joining us to make Blue Ocean a great user experience\nfor Jenkins, please join the Blue Ocean development\nteam on Gitter!","title":"Say hello to Blue Ocean 1.0","tags":["blueocean","ux","pipeline"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"i386","html":"","id":"i386","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"James Dumay","slug":"blog/author/i386","twitter":"i386"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ef0f71cf-7b8f-528c-bdbf-cb7997704db5","slug":"/blog/2017/04/05/welcome-to-blue-ocean/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Liam Newman,\nTechnical Evangelist at CloudBees.\n\nWelcome to Blue Ocean 1.0!\n\nIn case you‚Äôve been heads down on other projects\nfor the past 10 months,\nBlue Ocean is a new user experience for Jenkins,\nand version 1.0 was released today!\nBlue Ocean makes Jenkins, and continuous delivery, approachable to all team members.\nI‚Äôve been working with it for the past several months, and I can tell you it is amazing.\nI wish all the interactions with Jenkins were as easy as this:\n\n10 minutes to Blue Ocean\n\nBlue Ocean is simple to install and will work on basically any Jenkins 2 instance (version 2.7 or later).\nEven better, it runs side-by-side with the existing Jenkins web UI -\nyou can switch back and forth between them whenever you like.\nThere‚Äôs really no risk.\nIf you have a Jenkins instance and a good network connection,\nin 10 minutes you could be using Blue Ocean.\n\nLogin to your Jenkins server\n\nClick Manage Jenkins in the sidebar then Manage Plugins\n\nChoose the Available tab and use the search bar to find Blue Ocean\n\nClick the checkbox in the Install column\n\nClick either Install without restart or Download now and install after\nrestart\n\nAfter you install Blue Ocean, you can start using it\nby clicking on Open Blue Ocean in the navigation bar of the\nJenkins web UI, or you can navigate directly to Blue Ocean by adding\n/blue to your Jenkins URL, for example https://ci.jenkins.io/blue .\n\nIf you have to go back to the \"classic\" Jenkins UI,\nthere‚Äôs an \"exit\" icon located at the top of every page in Blue Ocean.\n\nDive in!\n\nThat‚Äôs it!

You will notice this in a few places in the\napp now.\n\nSome other things that made it to master branch which have not yet been\nreleased in a beta:\n\nAn API to save/branch to GitHub was finished, and tested with \"round\ntripping\" with the Editor in some form\n\nNew compact form of duration reporting (old style was too verbose for\nmost screens)\n\nFixed a bug with input submissions with concurrent browser sessions which was\nquite a tricky bug to chase down!\n\nOnly show Admin link when appropriate.\n\nMany many bug fixes and polishing.\n\nThere has also been an uptick in activity on the\nGitter channel with an\nincreased number of questions about usage and Pipelines. But also questions\nfrom people starting to extend, or add features, to Blue Ocean, which is very\nnice to see.\n\nGavin Mogan has been looking at integrating\nthe Sauce OnDemand plugin into Blue Ocean for better\nbrowser-test reporting.

We are happy to announce that you can try\nthe Pipeline Editor preview release today.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe Visual Pipeline Editor is the simplest way for anyone wanting to get started with\ncreating Pipelines in Jenkins. It‚Äôs also a great way for advanced Jenkins users\nto start adopting pipeline. It allows developers to break up their pipeline into different\n stages and parallelize tasks that can occur at the same time - graphically.\n The rest is up to you.\n\nA pipeline you create visually will produce a Declarative Pipeline Jenkinsfile for you and\n the Jenkinsfile is stored within a Git repository where it is versioned with your application code.\n\nIf you are not sure what a Jenkins Pipeline or a Jenkinsfile is, why not check out the new guided tour to learn more about it?\n\nWhat are we doing next?\n\nWe are working hard to provide feature parity between the Declarative Pipeline syntax and the visual editor. The next phase is to integrate the editor into Blue Ocean so that you don‚Äôt have to leave the UI and commit the Jenkinsfile to your repository to complete authoring your pipeline.\n\nIn Blue Ocean, you will be able to edit a Jenkinsfile\nfor a branch directly from within the user interface using the Visual Pipeline Editor. When you are done authoring your pipeline, the pipeline definition will be saved back to your repository as a Jenkinsfile. You can edit the Pipeline again using the Visual Editor or from your favorite text editor.\n\nWe are hoping to deliver this level of integration into Blue Ocean and the\nVisual Pipeline Editor over the next few months, so be sure to check regularly for updates in\nthe Jenkins plugin manager.\n\nGet the Preview\n\nThe Visual Pipeline Editor is available in preview today.\n\nTo try it out today:\n\nInstall the Blue Ocean beta and Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor from the Jenkins plugin manager\n\nClick on the Open Blue Ocean button and then the Pipeline Editor in the main navigation\n\nWe are looking forward to your feedback to help make the Visual Pipeline Editor\nthe easiest way to get started with Jenkins Pipeline. To report bugs or to\nrequest features please follow the instructions on the project page.\n\nAnd don‚Äôt forget to join us on our Gitter community chat\n- drop by and say hello!","title":"Say Hello to the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor","tags":["blueocean","editor","declarative","pipeline"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"i386","html":"","id":"i386","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"James Dumay","slug":"blog/author/i386","twitter":"i386"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"blueocean","limit":8,"skip":8,"numPages":4,"currentPage":2}},
