Like Jenkins itself, Drupal is easy to set up, install\nplugins and authoring content is done in a web UI. For the past seven years Drupal\nhas served us well, but it is time to move on to something better suited for our needs.\n\nThe general requirements for something newer were:\n\nEasy to edit and create content\n\nChanges to content should be tracked and reviewable\n\nAny Jenkins contributor should be able to participate\n\nSupport mixed content types\n\nThe consensus was that a statically-generated site, with raw content hosted on\nGitHub, would meet the majority of the \"ease-of-use\" type requirements. The\nremainder could be addressed depending on the implementation. A couple of years\nago I tried to rebuild the site with static content using\nJekyll, commonly used by\nGitHub Pages, but the effort stalled as I ran\ninto challenges with the mixture of content types we need to manage (stories,\nevents, pages, people, etc).\n\nHaving recently discovered Awestruct, a more\nversatile and sophisticated static-site generator that powers sites like\nasciidoctor.org, I ventured down that path.\n\nTo make a long story short, over the holiday break I finally pulled the trigger\nand switched jenkins-ci.org over to the new site. In fact, the page youâ€™re\nreading right now was authored and published via our new\njenkins static site.\n\nIf you look at the bottom left-hand corner of this page\nthere is a link titled \"Improve this page\" which will take you directly to\nGitHub to edit this post!\n\nWe have many more improvements to come for the Jenkins website, which are\ntracked\nin JIRA, but for now I invite members of the Jenkins community to help curate,\ncorrect and create new blog posts and pages for jenkins-ci.org!\n\nCheck it all out on GitHub","title":"A new Jenkins website","tags":["www"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
