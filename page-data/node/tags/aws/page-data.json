In this post I’ll show how the new AWS Secrets Manager Credentials Provider plugin allows you to marshal your secrets into one place, and use them securely from Jenkins.\n\nWhen CI/CD pipelines moved to the public cloud, credential management did not evolve with them. If you’re in this situation, you may have seen a number of tactical workarounds to keep Jenkins builds talking to the services they depend on. The workarounds range from bad (hardcoding plaintext secrets into Git) to merely painful (wrangling Hiera EYAML), but their common feature is that they tend to make copies of secrets beyond the reach of automation. This increases their attack surface, makes routine key rotation impractical, and makes remediation difficult after a breach.\n\nThe good news is that there is a better way!\n\nAWS Secrets Manager is a comprehensive solution for secure secret storage. You define a secret just once for your whole AWS account, then you give your consumers permission to use the secrets. Secrets Manager lets you manage a secret entry (name and metadata) separately from its value, and it integrates with other AWS services that you already use:\n\nSecret entry management: Manual (Web console, AWS CLI) or with an infrastructure management tool ( Terraform, CloudFormation etc.)\n\nSecret value management: Manual (Web console, AWS CLI) or automatic (secret rotation Lambda function).\n\nAccess control: AWS IAM policies (for both applications and human operators).\n\nSecret encryption: Amazon KMS automatically encrypts the secret value. Use either the account’s default KMS key, or a customer-managed KMS key.\n\nAuditing: AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Events.\n\nA couple of teams in my company started to use Secrets Manager from Jenkins jobs by calling the AWS CLI, but this remained a niche approach as it was quite unwieldy. There was clearly an appetite to integrate key developer apps with a centralised secrets store, but production-ready integrations were needed for wider adoption. So this year I created the AWS Secrets Manager Credentials Provider plugin for Jenkins, with help from friends in the Jenkins community, to do exactly that.\n\nThis is how you set it up…​\n\nInstall the plugin from the Jenkins update center.\n\nGive Jenkins read-only access to Secrets Manager with an IAM policy.\n\n(Optional) Configure the plugin, either through the Global Configuration screen or Jenkins Configuration As Code.\n\nThis is how you use it…​\n\nCreate your build secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. (You can start by uploading secrets via the AWS CLI. More sophisticated methods of secret creation are also available.)\n\nView the credentials in the Jenkins UI, to check that Jenkins can see them.\n\nBind the credentials by ID in your Jenkins job.\n\nThe provider supports the following standard Jenkins credential types:\n\nSecret Text\n\nUsername With Password\n\nSSH User Private Key\n\nPKCS#12 Certificate\n\nAnd it has powerful advantages over quick-fix tactical solutions:\n\nYour Jenkins jobs consume the credentials with no knowledge of Secrets Manager, so they stay vendor-independent.\n\nThe provider caches relevant Secrets Manager API calls, for a quicker and more reliable experience.\n\nThe provider integrates with the ecosystem of existing Jenkins credential consumers, such as the Git and SSH Agent plugins.\n\nThe provider records credential usage in the central Jenkins credentials tracking log.\n\nJenkins can use multiple credentials providers concurrently, so you can incrementally migrate credentials to Secrets Manager while consuming other credentials from your existing providers.\n\nAfter the plugin’s first public release, developers at other companies adopted it too. It has had contributions so far from people at Elsevier, GoDaddy, and Northeastern University, as well as the fantastic Jenkins core team. We even got fan mail for our work!\n\nIn enterprise security, \"The important things are always simple. The simple things are always hard. The easy way is always mined.\" ( @thegrugq) It’s easy to buy a shiny ‘next generation' security appliance and drop it into your network. But it’s hard to embed the security fundamentals (like secrets management, OS patching, secure development) across your organisation. This Jenkins plugin is part of the effort [ 1 ] to take one of the persistent hard problems in security, and make it easier for everyone.\n\n1.

Several other EC2 customers like Mozilla have\nalso reduced costs of their\ncontinuous integration, deployment and testing pipelines by up to 90% on Spot instances. You can view\nthe current savings on Spot instances over EC2 On-demand instances using the\nSpot Bid Advisor :\n\nAWS Spot instances are spare EC2 instances that you can bid on. While your Spot instances may be\nterminated when EC2’s spare capacity declines, you can automatically replenish these instances and\nmaintain your target capacity using\nEC2 Spot fleets. As each\ninstance type and Availability Zone provides an alternative capacity pool, you can select multiple\nsuch pools to launch the lowest priced instances currently available by launching a Spot\nfleet on the Amazon EC2 Spot Requests console\nor using the AWS CLI/SDK tools.\n\nIn this walkthrough, we’ll show you how to configure Jenkins to automatically scale a fleet of Spot\ninstances up or down depending on the number jobs to be completed.\n\nRequest an Amazon EC2 Spot fleet\n\nTo get started, login to Amazon EC2 console, and click on Spot Requests\nin the left hand navigation pane. Alternatively, you can directly login to\nAmazon EC2 Spot Requests console. Then click on the\nRequest Spot Instances button at the top of the dashboard.\n\nIn the Spot instance launch wizard, select the Request & Maintain option to request a Spot fleet that automatically\nprovisions the most cost-effective EC2 Spot instances, and replenishes them if interrupted. Enter an initial\ntarget capacity, choose an AMI, and select multiple instance types to automatically provision the lowest priced\ninstances available.\n\nOn the next page, ensure that you have selected a key pair, complete the launch wizard, and note the Spot\nfleet request ID.\n\nAmazon EC2 Spot fleet automates finding the lowest priced instances for you, and enables your Jenkins cluster\nto maintain the required capacity; so, you don’t need any bidding algorithms to provision the optimal Spot\ninstances over time.\n\nConfigure Jenkins\n\nInstall the Plugin\n\nFrom the Jenkins dashboard, select Manage Jenkins, and then click Manage Plugins. On the Available tab,\nsearch for and select the EC2 Fleet Jenkins Plugin. Then click the Install button.\n\nAfter the plugin installation is completed, select Manage Jenkins from the Jenkins dashboard, and\nclick Configure System. In the Cloud section, select Amazon Spot Fleet to add a new Cloud.\n\nConfigure AWS Credentials\n\nNext, we will configure the AWS and agent node credentials. Click the Add button next to AWS Credentials,\nselect Jenkins, and enter your AWS Access Key, secret, and ID.\n\nNext, click the Add button in the Spot fleet launcher to configure your agents with an SSH key.\nSelect Jenkins, and enter the username and private key (from the key pair you configured in your Spot fleet request)\nas shown below.\n\nConfirm that the AWS and SSH credentials you just added are selected. Then choose the region, and the Spot fleet\nrequest ID from the drop-down. You can also enter the maximum idle time before your cluster automatically scales\ndown, and the maximum cluster size that it can scale up to.\n\nSubmit Jobs and View Status\n\nAfter you have finished the previous step, you can view the EC2 Fleet Status in the left hand navigation pane on\nthe Jenkins dashboard. Now, as you submit more jobs, Jenkins will automatically scale your Spot fleet to add more\nnodes. You can view these new nodes executing jobs under the Build Executor Status.\nAfter the jobs are done, if the nodes remain free for the specified idle time (configured in the previous step),\nthen Jenkins releases the nodes, automatically scaling down your Spot fleet nodes.\n\nBuild faster and cheaper\n\nIf you have a story to share about your team or product, or have a question to ask, do leave a comment\nfor us; we’d love to connect with you!","title":"Save up to 90% of CI cost on AWS with Jenkins and EC2 Spot Fleet","tags":["aws","plugins","ec2"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"aws","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
