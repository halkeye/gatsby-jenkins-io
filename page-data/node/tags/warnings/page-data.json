The plugin (and the associated static analysis plugin suite) has been part of the Jenkins plugin eco-system\nfor more than ten years now. In order to optimize user experience and support Pipeline, a major rewrite of\nthe whole set of plugins was necessary. This new version (code name White Mountain) is now available as a public\nbeta. Please download and install this new version and help us to identify problems before the API is sealed.\n\nThe new release is available in the\nexperimental update center.\nIt has built-in support for almost hundred static analysis tools (including several compilers), see the list of\nsupported report formats.\n\nFeatures overview\n\nThe Warnings plugin provides the following features when added as a post build action (or step) to a job:\n\nThe plugin scans the console log of a Jenkins build or files in the workspace of your job for any kind of issues.\nThere are almost one hundred\nreport formats supported.\nAmong the problems it can detect:\n\nerrors from your compiler (C, C#, Java, etc.)\n\nwarnings from a static analysis tool (CheckStyle, StyleCop, SpotBugs, etc.)\n\nduplications from a copy-and-paste detector (CPD, Simian, etc.)\n\nvulnerabilities\n\nopen tasks in comments of your source files\n\nThe plugin publishes a report of the issues found in your build, so you can navigate to a summary report from the\nmain build page. From there you can also dive into the details:\n\ndistribution of new, fixed and outstanding issues\n\ndistribution of the issues by severity, category, type, module, or package\n\nlist of all issues including helpful comments from the reporting tool\n\nannotated source code of the affected files\n\ntrend charts of the issues\n\nIn the next sections, Iâ€™ll show the new and enhanced features in more detail.\n\nOne plugin for all tools\n\nPreviously the warnings plugin was part of the static analysis suite that provided the same set of features through\nseveral plugins (CheckStyle, PMD, Static Analysis Utilities, Analysis Collector etc.).\nIn order to simplify the user experience and the development process, these\nplugins and the core functionality have been merged into the warnings plugin. All other plugins are not required\nanymore and will not be supported in the future. If you currently use one of these plugins you should migrate\nto the new recorders and steps as soon as possible. I will still maintain the old code for a while,\nbut the main development effort will be spent into the new code base.\n\nThe following plugins have been integrated into the beta version of the warnings plugin:\n\nAndroid-Lint Plugin\n\nCheckStyle Plugin\n\nCCM Plugin\n\nDry Plugin\n\nPMD Plugin\n\nFindBugs Plugin\n\nAll other plugins still need to be integrated or need to be refactored to use the new API.\n\nNew pipeline support\n\nRequirements for using the Warnings plugin in Jenkins Pipeline can be complex and sometimes controversial.\nIn order to be as flexible as possible I decided to split the main step into two individual parts,\nwhich could then be used independently from each other.\n\nSimple pipeline configuration\n\nThe simple pipeline configuration is provided by the step recordIssues. This step is automatically derived from the\nFreeStyle job recorder: it scans for issues in a given set of files (or in the console log) and reports these issues\nin your build. You can use the snippet generator to create a working snippet that calls this step. A typical example\nof this step is shown in the following example:\n\nrecordIssues\n    enabledForFailure: true,\n    tools: [[pattern: '*.log', tool: [$class: 'Java']]],\n    filters: [includeFile('MyFile.*.java'), excludeCategory('WHITESPACE')]\n\nIn this example, the files '*.log' are scanned for Java issues. Only issues with a file name matching the\npattern 'MyFile.*.java' are included. Issues with category 'WHITESPACE' will be excluded. The\nstep will be executed even if the build failed. The recorded report of warnings will be published under the fixed\nURL 'https://[ your-jenkins ]/job/[ your-job ]/java'. URL or name of the report can be changed if required.\n\nAdvanced Pipeline Configuration\n\nSometimes publishing and reporting issues using a single step is not sufficient. For instance, if you build your\nproduct using several parallel steps and you want to combine the issues from all of these steps into\na single result. Then you need to split scanning and aggregation. Therefore, the plugin  provides the following\ntwo steps that are combined by using an intermediate result object:\n\nscanForIssues : this step scans a report file or the console log with a particular parser and creates an\nintermediate report object that contains the report.\n\npublishIssues : this step publishes a new report in your build that contains the aggregated results\nof one or several scanForIssues steps.\n\nYou can see the usage of these two steps in the following example:\n\ndef java = scanForIssues tool: [$class: 'Java']\ndef javadoc = scanForIssues tool: [$class: 'JavaDoc']\n\npublishIssues issues:[java, javadoc], filters:[includePackage('io.jenkins.plugins.analysis.*')]\n\ndef checkstyle = scanForIssues tool: [$class: 'CheckStyle'], pattern: '**/target/checkstyle-result.xml'\npublishIssues issues:[checkstyle]\n\ndef pmd = scanForIssues tool: [$class: 'Pmd'], pattern: '**/target/pmd.xml'\npublishIssues issues:[pmd]\n\npublishIssues id:'analysis', name:'White Mountains Issues', issues:[checkstyle, pmd],\n    filters:[includePackage('io.jenkins.plugins.analysis.*')]\n\nFiltering issues\n\nThe created report of issues can be filtered afterwards. You can specify an arbitrary number of include or exclude\nfilters. Currently, there is support for filtering issues by module name, package or namespace name, file name,\ncategory or type.\n\nAn example pipeline that uses such a filter is shown in the following snippet:\n\nrecordIssues\n    tools: [[pattern: '*.log', tool: [$class: 'Java']]],\n    filters: [includeFile('MyFile.*.java'), excludeCategory('WHITESPACE')]\n\nQuality gate configuration\n\nYou can define several quality gates that will be checked after the issues have been reported. These quality gates\nlet you to modify Jenkins' build status so that you immediately see if the desired quality of your product is met.\nA build can be set to unstable or failed for each of these quality gates. All quality gates use a simple metric:\nthe maximum number of issues that can be found and still pass a given quality gate.\n\nAn example pipeline that enables a quality gate for 10 warnings in total or 1 new warning is shown in the\nfollowing snippet:\n\nrecordIssues\n    tools: [[pattern: '*.log', tool: [$class: 'Java']]], unstableTotalHigh: 10, unstableNewAll: 1\n\nIssues history: new, fixed, and outstanding issues\n\nOne highlight of the plugin is the ability to categorize issues of subsequent builds as new, fixed and outstanding.\n\nUsing this feature makes it a lot easier to keep the quality of your project under control: you can focus\nonly on those warnings that have been introduced recently.\n\nNote: the detection of new warnings is based on a complex algorithm that tries to track the same warning in\ntwo two different versions of the source code. Depending on the extend of the modification of the source code\nit might produce some false positives, i.e., you might still get some new and fixed warnings even if there should\nbe none. The accuracy of this algorithm is still ongoing research and will be refined in the next couple of months.\n\nSeverities\n\nThe plugin shows the distribution of the severities of the issues in a chart. It defines the\nfollowing default severities, but additional ones might be added by plugins that extend the warnings plugin.\n\nError : Indicates an error that typically fails the build\n\nWarning (High, Normal, Low): Indicates a warning of the given priority. Mapping to the priorities\nis up to the individual parsers.\n\nNote that not every parser is capable of producing warnings with a different severity. Some of the parses simply\nuse the same severity for all issues.\n\nBuild Trend\n\nIn order to see the trend of the analysis results, a chart showing the number of issues per build is also\nshown. This chart is used in the details page as well as in the job overview. Currently, type and configuration\nof the chart is fixed. This will be enhanced in future versions of the plugin.\n\nIssues Overview\n\nYou can get a fast and efficient overview of the reported set of issues in several aggregation views.\nDepending on the number or type of issues you will see the distribution of issues by\n\nStatic Analysis Tool\n\nModule\n\nPackage or Namespace\n\nSeverity\n\nCategory\n\nType\n\nEach of these detail views are interactive, i.e. you can navigate into a subset of the categorized issues.\n\nIssues Details\n\nThe set of reported issues is shown in a modern and responsive table. The table is loaded on demand using an Ajax\ncall. It provides the following features:\n\nPagination : the number of issues is subdivided into several pages which can be selected by using the provided page\nlinks. Note that currently the pagination is done on the client side, i.e. it may take some time to obtain the whole table of\nissues from the server.\n\nSorting : the table content can be sorted by clicking on ony of the table columns.\n\nFiltering, Searching : you can filter the shown issues by entering some text in the search box.\n\nContent Aware : columns are only shown if there is something useful to display. I.e., if a tool does not report an\nissues category, then the category will be automatically hidden.\n\nResponsive : the layout should adapt to the actual screen size.\n\nDetails : the details message for an issue (if provided by the corresponding static analysis tool) is shown as\nchild row within the table.\n\nRemote API\n\nThe plugin provides two REST API endpoints.\n\nSummary of the analysis result\n\nYou can obtain a summary of a particular analysis report by using the URL [tool-id]/api/xml\n(or [tool-id]/api/json). The summary contains the number of issues, the quality gate status, and all\ninfo and error messages.\n\nDetails of the analysis result\n\nThe reported issues are also available as REST API. You can either query all issues or only the\nnew, fixed, or outstanding issues. The corresponding URLs are:\n\n[tool-id]/all/api/xml : lists all issues\n\n[tool-id]/fixed/api/xml : lists all fixed issues\n\n[tool-id]/new/api/xml : lists all new issues\n\n[tool-id]/outstanding/api/xml : lists all outstanding issues\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nI hope these new features are useful for everyone! Please download or install this new release and test it in your jobs:\n\nConvert some of your jobs to the new API and test the new (and old) features (based on your requirements).\n\nRead all labels carefully, Iâ€™m not a native speaker so some descriptions might be misleading or incorrect.\n\nCheck the new URLs and names of the parsers, see list of\nsupported report formats. These\ncanâ€™t be changed after the beta testing.\n\nIf you find a problem, incorrect phrase, typo, etc. please report a bug in Jira (or even better: file a PR in GitHub).\n\nThis has been a brief overview of the new features of the Warnings plugin in Jenkins.
