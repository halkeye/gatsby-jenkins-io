For this post, I’m going to use\nthe\nblog/add-declarative-pipeline\nbranch of\nmy fork of the JUnit plugin.\nI’m going to set up a Multi-branch Pipeline and point it at my repository.\n\nI’ve also set this Pipeline’s Git configuration to automatically \"clean after\ncheckout\" and to only keep the ten most recent runs.\n\nWriting a Minimal Pipeline\n\nAs has been said before, Declarative Pipeline provides a more structured,\n\"opinionated\" way to create Pipelines. I’m going to start by creating a minimal\nDeclarative Pipeline and adding it to my branch.  Below is a minimal Pipeline\n(with annotations) that just prints a message:\n\n// Declarative //\npipeline { (1)\nagent any // <2> (3)\nstages { (4)\nstage('Build') { (5)\nsteps { (6)\necho 'This is a minimal pipeline.' (7)\n}\n        }\n    }\n}\n// Scripted //\nnode { (2)\ncheckout scm (3)\nstage ('Build') { (5)\necho 'This is a minimal pipeline.' (6)\n}\n}\n\n1\nAll Declarative Pipelines start with a pipeline section.\n\n2\nSelect where to run this Pipeline, in this case \"any\" agent, regardless of label.\n\n3\nDeclarative automatically performs a checkout of source code on the agent,\nwhereas Scripted Pipeline users must explicitly call checkout scm,\n\n4\nA Declarative Pipeline is defined as a series of stages.\n\n5\nRun the \"Build\" stage.\n\n6\nEach stage in a Declarative Pipeline runs a series of steps.\n\n7\nRun the echo step to print a message in the Console Output.\n\nIf you are familiar with Scripted Pipeline, you can toggle the above\nDeclarative code sample to show the Scripted equivalent.\n\nOnce I add the Pipeline above to my Jenkinsfile and run \"Branch Indexing\", my\nJenkins will pick it up and run run it.  We see that the Declarative Pipeline\nhas added stage called \"Declarative: Checkout SCM\":\n\nThis a \"dynamic stage\", one of several the kinds that Declarative Pipeline adds\nas needed for clearer reporting.  In this case, it is a stage in which the\nDeclarative Pipeline automatically checkouts out source code on the agent.\n\nAs you can see above, we didn’t have to tell it do any of this,\n\nConsole Output\n\n[Pipeline] node\nRunning on osx_mbp in /Users/bitwiseman/jenkins/agents/osx_mbp/workspace/blog_add-declarative-pipeline\n[Pipeline] {\n[Pipeline] stage\n[Pipeline] { (Declarative: Checkout SCM)\n[Pipeline] checkout\nCloning the remote Git repository\n{ ... truncated 20 lines ... }\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // stage\n[Pipeline] stage\n[Pipeline] { (Build)\n[Pipeline] echo\nThis is a minimal pipeline\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // stage\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // node\n[Pipeline] End of Pipeline\nFinished: SUCCESS\n\nDeclarative Pipeline syntax is a little more verbose than the equivalent Scripted Pipeline,\nbut the added detail gives a clearer, more consistent view of what the Pipeline is supposed to do.\nIt also gives us a structure into which we can add more configuration details about this Pipeline.\n\nAdding Tools to Pipeline\n\nThe next thing we’ll add in this Pipeline is a tools section to let us use\nMaven.  The tools section is one of several sections we can add under\npipeline, which affect the configuration of the rest of the Pipeline.  (We’ll\nlook at the others, including agent, in later posts.) Each tool entry will\nmake whatever settings changes, such as updating PATH or other environment\nvariables, to make the named tool available in the current pipeline.  It will\nalso automatically install the named tool if that tool is configured to do so\nunder \"Managing Jenkins\" → \"Global Tool Configuration\".\n\n// Declarative //\npipeline {\n    agent any\n    tools { (1)\nmaven 'Maven 3.3.9' (2)\njdk 'jdk8' (3)\n}\n    stages {\n        stage ('Initialize') {\n            steps {\n                sh '''\n                    echo \"PATH = ${PATH}\"\n                    echo \"M2_HOME = ${M2_HOME}\"\n                ''' (4)\n}\n        }\n\n        stage ('Build') {\n            steps {\n                echo 'This is a minimal pipeline.'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n// Scripted Not Defined //\n\n1\ntools section for adding tool settings.\n\n2\nConfigure this Pipeline to use the Maven version matching \"Maven 3.3.9\"\n(configured in \"Managing Jenkins\" → \"Global Tool Configuration\").\n\n3\nConfigure this Pipeline to use the Maven version matching \"jdk8\"\n(configured in \"Managing Jenkins\" → \"Global Tool Configuration\").\n\n4\nThese will show the values of PATH and M2_HOME environment variables.\n\nWhen we run this updated Pipeline the same way we ran the first, we see that\nthe Declarative Pipeline has added another stage called \"Declarative: Tool\nInstall\": In the console output, we see that during this particular stage \"Maven 3.3.9\" gets installed,\nand the PATH and M2_HOME environment variables are set:\n\nConsole Output\n\n{ ... truncated lines ... }\n[Pipeline] // stage\n[Pipeline] stage\n[Pipeline] { (Declarative: Tool Install)\n[Pipeline] tool\nUnpacking https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.3.9/apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.zip\nto /Users/bitwiseman/jenkins/agents/osx_mbp/tools/hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation/Maven_3.3.9\non osx_mbp\n[Pipeline] envVarsForTool\n[Pipeline] tool\n[Pipeline] envVarsForTool\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // stage\n{ ... }\nPATH = /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_92.jdk/Contents/Home/bin:/Users/bitwiseman/jenkins/agents/osx_mbp/tools/hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation/Maven_3.3.9/bin:...\nM2_HOME = /Users/bitwiseman/jenkins/agents/osx_mbp/tools/hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation/Maven_3.3.9\n{ ... }\n\nRunning a Maven Build\n\nFinally, running a Maven build is trivial.  The tools section already added\nMaven and JDK8 to the PATH, all we need to do is call mvn install.  It\nwould be nice if I could split the build and the tests into separate stages,\nbut Maven is famous for not liking when people do that, so I’ll leave it alone\nfor now.\n\nInstead, let’s load up the results of the build using the JUnit plugin,\nhowever the version that was just built, sorry.\n\n// Declarative //\npipeline {\n    agent any\n    tools {\n        maven 'Maven 3.3.9'\n        jdk 'jdk8'\n    }\n    stages {\n        stage ('Initialize') {\n            steps {\n                sh '''\n                    echo \"PATH = ${PATH}\"\n                    echo \"M2_HOME = ${M2_HOME}\"\n                '''\n            }\n        }\n\n        stage ('Build') {\n            steps {\n                sh 'mvn -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true install' (1)\n}\n            post {\n                success {\n                    junit 'target/surefire-reports/**/*.xml' (2)\n}\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n// Scripted //\nnode {\n    checkout scm\n\n    String jdktool = tool name: \"jdk8\", type: 'hudson.model.JDK'\n    def mvnHome = tool name: 'mvn'\n\n    /* Set JAVA_HOME, and special PATH variables. */\n    List javaEnv = [\n        \"PATH+MVN=${jdktool}/bin:${mvnHome}/bin\",\n        \"M2_HOME=${mvnHome}\",\n        \"JAVA_HOME=${jdktool}\"\n    ]\n\n    withEnv(javaEnv) {\n    stage ('Initialize') {\n        sh '''\n            echo \"PATH = ${PATH}\"\n            echo \"M2_HOME = ${M2_HOME}\"\n        '''\n    }\n    stage ('Build') {\n        try {\n            sh 'mvn -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true install'\n        } catch (e) {\n            currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'\n        }\n    }\n    stage ('Post') {\n        if (currentBuild.result == null || currentBuild.result == 'SUCCESS') {\n            junit 'target/surefire-reports/**/*.xml' (2)\n}\n    }\n}\n\n1\nCall mvn, the version configured by the tools section will be first on the path.\n\n2\nIf the maven build succeeded, archive the JUnit test reports for display in the Jenkins web UI.\nWe’ll discuss the\npost section in detail in the next blog post.\n\nIf you are familiar with Scripted Pipeline, you can toggle the above\nDeclarative code sample to show the Scripted equivalent.\n\nBelow is the console output for this last revision:\n\nConsole Output\n\n{ ... truncated lines ... }\n+ mvn install\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\n[WARNING] The POM for org.jenkins-ci.tools:maven-hpi-plugin:jar:1.119 is missing, no dependency information available\n[WARNING] Failed to build parent project for org.jenkins-ci.plugins:junit:hpi:1.20-SNAPSHOT\n[INFO]\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Building JUnit Plugin 1.20-SNAPSHOT\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO]\n[INFO] --- maven-hpi-plugin:1.119:validate (default-validate) @ junit ---\n[INFO]\n[INFO] --- maven-enforcer-plugin:1.3.1:display-info (display-info) @ junit ---\n[INFO] Maven Version: 3.3.9\n[INFO] JDK Version: 1.8.0_92 normalized as: 1.8.0-92\n[INFO] OS Info: Arch: x86_64 Family: mac Name: mac os x Version: 10.12.3\n[INFO]\n{ ... }\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Total time: 03:25 min\n[INFO] Finished at: 2017-02-06T22:43:41-08:00\n[INFO] Final Memory: 84M/1265M\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion\n\nThe new Declarative syntax is a significant step forward for Jenkins Pipeline.\nIt trades some verbosity and constraints for much greater clarity and\nmaintainability.  In the coming weeks, I’ll be adding new blog posts\ndemonstrating various features of the Declarative syntax along with some recent\nJenkins Pipeline improvements.\n\nLinks\n\nDeclarative Pipeline\n\nDeclarative Pipeline Syntax Reference\n\nJenkins JUnit plugin","title":"Declarative Pipeline for Maven Projects","tags":["tutorial","pipeline","declarative","maven","java"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"bitwiseman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Liam started his software career as a tester, which might explain why he&#8217;s such a fan of CI/CD and Pipeline as Code.\nHe has spent the majority of his software engineering career implementing Continuous Integration systems at companies big and small.\nHe is a Jenkins project contributor and an expert in Jenkins Pipeline, both Scripted and Declarative.\nLiam currently works as a Jenkins Evangelist at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>.\nWhen not at work, he enjoys testing gravity by doing Aikido.</p>\n</div>","id":"lnewman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Liam Newman","slug":"/blog/author/lnewman","twitter":"bitwiseman"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"declarative","limit":8,"skip":8,"numPages":2,"currentPage":2}},
