Just like other events this year, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that doesn’t mean there is a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There will be over 50 Jenkins/open source sessions and opportunities to virtually connect with over 20,000+ attendees on the event platform. Below are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :\n\nJenkins: Where It Is and Where It is Going\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 7:00 a.m.-7:30 a.m (PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Oleg Nenashev\n\nJenkins keeps evolving to address demands from its users and contributors: configuration as code, better support of cloud-native technologies, etc. Recently, we have introduced a public roadmap for the project, and there are many key initiatives in development and preview phases. This session will cover the current state of Jenkins and what’s next for the project.\n\nManaging DevSecOps Pipelines at Scale with Jenkins Templating Engine\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 11:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. (PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Steven Terrana\n\nAre you currently helping build or maintain a Jenkins pipeline for more than one application or team? Are you tired of copying and pasting Jenkinsfiles and tweaking them to fit each team’s specific needs? This session will feature a live demonstration of getting up and running with the Jenkins Templating Engine (JTE). Attendees will learn how to stop creating bespoke pipelines on a per-application basis and, instead, create tool-agnostic pipeline templates that multiple teams can inherit - regardless of tech stack.\n\neBay’s Journey Building CI at Scale\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 22, 12:30 p.m.-1:00 p.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeakers: Ravi Kiran Rao Bukka & Vasumathy Seenuvasan\n\nA scalable CI platform with 6,000+ Jenkins instances serving around 43,000 builds per day on multi-cluster Kubernetes. A system built with metrics, key resource tuning, remediation’s and security in place. Join this session to hear from eBay on their journey of best practices and learnings about open source.\n\nMachine Learning Plugins for Data Science in Jenkins\n\nDate: Wednesday, September 23, 11:00 a.m.-11:15 a.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeaker: Loghi Perinpanayagam\n\nMachine Learning has evolved rapidly in the software industry for recent years. Jenkins CI/CD can be a good practice to deliver a high reliable product in the end. We have done an initial startup on this plugin that can be used to build Jupyter Notebooks, Python files and JSON files in Zeppelin format. In addition, the build wrappers could be used to convert Jupyter Notebooks to Python/JSON and/or copy the files to the workspace for more actions.  This Machine Learning plugin will endeavor to satisfy the data science community together with the help of other plugins. Success of this plugin will definitely serve much benefits to the community and Jenkins.\n\nJenkins UI Gets a Makeover\n\nDate: Thursday, September 24, 7:30 a.m.-8:00 a.m.(PDT)\n\nSpeakers: Felix Queiruga & Jeremy Hartley\n\nAn overview of the Jenkins UI overhaul. We are taking an iterative approach to gradually refresh the Jenkins UI. This approach will make Jenkins look fresh and modern, without changing the way users are accustomed to working with Jenkins or require plugins to be rewritten to render properly in the new Jenkins UI. Join this session to learn the changes we’ve made and how you can help to improve the Jenkins UI.\n\nThe event is free to everyone and recordings will be available on-demand. Registration is required to access the on-demand recordings. And don’t forget to visit the CDF booth in the expo hall for one on one Q&A’s with Jenkins experts.","title":"Jenkins at DevOps World 2020","tags":["events","conference","cicd","talks","workshops"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"blog/author/alyssat","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"workshops","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
