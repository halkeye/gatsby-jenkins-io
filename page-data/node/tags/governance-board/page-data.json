I want us to continue on that path.\nThis is a tremendous opportunity for community members to influence the direction of the project for the next two years.\nTo make this year’s election even better, we slightly modified the process by leveraging our new community platform aka community.jenkins.io.\n\nTo participate in the election, we ask every Jenkins community member to have an account on community.jenkins.io.\nYou can either reuse your Github account or create a new discourse account specific to community.jenkins.io.\nThe second requirement is to be able to showcase at least one contribution done before the first of September 2021.\nAs mentioned on jenkins.io.io/participate, they are many different ways to contribute to Jenkins and for many of them, it’s very difficult to measure.\nTherefore we’ll trust participants and will not require that they provide evidence of contribution as part of their voter registration. We reserve the right to ban the specific account from the election process if we identify abuse.\nThe election works in three stages:\n\nIdentify voters and nominees\n\nVoting period\n\nAnnounce results\n\nVoters\n\nTo invite participants to vote, we need a list of email’s addresses that we would share with the Condorcet Internet Voting Service.\nTherefore we ask every community member who matches the requirements to join the group election-voter on community.jenkins.io.\nThe group will be open for joining during the registration period after we’ll close registration during the voting period.\nWe’ll use emails from the “election-voter” group members.\n\nNominees\n\nDuring the same period, we invite every community member to nominate candidates by sending a message to the group election-committee mentioning the position and the motivation.\nOn the 31 of October, the nomination period will end. We’ll notify all the nominees and get confirmation that they are interested in running as a candidate.\nThe list of candidates will be announced on the 7th of November.\n\nEverybody can nominate candidates.\n\nThis year we are looking for nominees for the following positions:\n\nBoard members\n\nDocumentation Officer\n\nEvents Officer\n\nInfrastructure Officer\n\nRelease Officer\n\nSecurity Officer\n\nMore information about the different roles can be found on jenkins.io/project/team-leads.\n\nElection\n\nOn the 7th of November, once voters and candidates are identified, we’ll invite everybody by email to vote using civs.cs.cornell.edu.\nAt this stage of the election, nobody will be allowed to register.\nVoting deadline is the 30th of November.\n\nResult\n\nAs soon as we have the election results, we’ll publish them.\nElected members will begin their official roles on the 3rd of December 2021.\n\nKey Dates\n\nSep 20: Nomination and voter registration begin\n\nOct 31: Nomination deadline\n\nNov 07: Candidates announced, Registration deadline, voting start\n\nNov 30: Voting deadline\n\nDec 03: Results announced\n\nKey Information:\n\nEverybody can suggest candidates by sending a private message to the group election-committee.\n\nVoters register for the election by joining the public group election-voter.\n\nEmail participants will be shared with Condorcet Voting System to send voting invitations.\n\nNobody can register for the election once we send invitations to Condorcet Voting System.\n\nOnce the election is over, every member of the group\"election-voter\" will get a badge on https://community.jenkins.io as a “2021 Election Participant”.\n\nOnce the election is over, every nominee will get the badge “2021 Election Nominee”.\n\nCheers,","title":"Jenkins Election 2021","tags":["community","governance","governance-board","elections"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"olblak","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Olivier is the Jenkins infrastructure officer and Senior Operations Engineer at CloudBees.\nAs a regular contributor to the Jenkins infrastructure projects, he works on a wide range of tasks from services reliability to applications maintenance.</p>\n</div>","id":"olblak","irc":"olblak","linkedin":null,"name":"Olivier Vernin","slug":"/blog/author/olblak","twitter":"0lblak"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2021-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","id":"dc15bc48-7621-5827-9c36-0317e6e16cda","slug":"/blog/2021/03/22/governance-updates/","strippedHtml":"We would like to announce changes in the Jenkins Governance Board.\nAs it was announced earlier this month, Marky Jackson has decided to step down from his elected roles.\nOn behalf of the Jenkins community, we would like to thank Marky for all contributions and for the continued participation in the Jenkins community.\nAs an active Jenkins contributor and community leader, Marky helped a lot of initiatives to happen:\n Jenkins and Kubernetes ecosystem, terminology changes, GSoC and GSoD, pipeline authoring SIG and many more activities.\nThank you Marky!\n\nThe governance board has followed the interim procedure\nto nominate the new governance board member until the end of the term.\nThe board decided to respect the results of the 2020 elections and\nto nominate Ewelina Wilkosz who received the most of the votes after the elected candidates.\nShe has accepted the nomination, and on March 10th the Governance Meeting has confirmed it.\nWe are happy to welcome Ewelina Wilkosz as a new Governance Board Member!\n\nEwelina will join other governance Board Members:\nKohsuke Kawaguchi,\nUllrich Hafner,\nOleg Nenashev, and\nGavin Mogan.\nThe term will last until December 2022.\n\nAbout Ewelina Wilkosz\n\nEwelina has been a Jenkins Contributor since 2017, when she got involved in Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin development.\nVoted Most Valuable Jenkins Contributor in 2018.\nShe has 14 years of experience in IT, working as a CI/CD consultant since the beginning of 2017.\nIn that role she’s trying to solve numerous issues Jenkins users are facing daily -

from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.\nEvery day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.\nAs a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.\n\nThanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development\nI had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations\nwhere I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.\nHere are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:\nblogpost,\ncdCON presentation,\npodcast recording.\nSo my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,\nso I actually know what they need and why.\n\nWhat’s next for the Jenkins Governance Board?\n\nIn February we had the Jenkins Contributor Summit.\nThere we discussed many topics related to the Jenkins evolution and its roadmap.\nWe identified several initiatives we would like to focus on,\nincluding but not limited to improving user experience, contributor onboarding, and securing Jenkins delivery pipelines.\nThese initiatives will be a key focus until the next contributor summit we plan to organize in June.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and facilitating contributions to the project.\n\nParticipating in Jenkins Governance\n\nJenkins Governance Board has just a representative function in the community.\nThe project and the community have a long history of open and inclusive governance driven by many contributors.\nWe invite all community members to participate in the project by joining the\ngovernance meeting,\nparticipating in the mailing list conversations,\nand joining special interest groups driving particular topics.\n\nSee this page to know more about contributing to Jenkins in general.","title":"Welcome Ewelina Wilkosz -

Tyler Croy who step down from the Jenkins Governance Board this year.\nThanks to them for all contributions and for continued community leadership.\n\nStatement from Marky Jackson:\n\nIt is a tremendous honor to be elected to this roles. I am so humbled.\nBeing part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.\nMy goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.\nI look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.\n\n— Marky Jackson, Jenkins Governance Board Member and Events Officer\n\nStatement from Gavin Mogan:\n\nGavin here. I’m still in shock that I got voted in for the Jenkins board.\nIt felt like yesterday I just got started helping people randomly on IRC. This is truly exciting.\nI plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.\nThis is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.\nMy specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.\n\n— Gavin Mogan, Jenkins Governance Board Member\n\nOfficer election details\n\nAll 5 officer positions were up for election this year.\nThese roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2021.\nAfter the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,\n4 officer positions were uncontested:\n\nOlivier Vernin - Infrastructure officer.\n\nMarky Jackson - Events officer.\nMarky inherits this role from Alyssa Tong\nwho decided to step down from the officer role and to focus on the Jenkins community marketing,\nincluding Jenkins Is The Way and many other initiatives started by Alyssa.\n\nMark Waite - Documentation officer.\n\nDaniel Beck - Security officer.\n\nThanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!\nOfficers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.\nIt requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.\n\nRelease Officer election results\n\nTim Jacomb won the biggest support as a Release officer ( voting results).\nTim will replace in this role Oliver Gondža\nwho has been leading the Release Team and the release processes since 2016 when the role was officially introduced.\n\nTim Jacomb (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nBaptiste Mathus  loses to Tim Jacomb by 40–23\n\nVictor Martinez  loses to Tim Jacomb by 38–25, loses to Baptiste Mathus by 32–31\n\nHere is a statement from Tim Jacomb:\n\nI’m excited for the year ahead, let’s see where we can take the Jenkins release area in the future.\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation, ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team,\nand ensure that responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.\n\n— Tim Jacomb, Jenkins Release Officer\n\nThanks to Alyssa Tong and Oliver Gondža for their long-time service as Jenkins officers!\nWe are looking to continue working with them in the Jenkins community.\nAnd congratulations to Tim Jacomb and Marky Jackson for joining the team!\n\nStatistics\n\nThis year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.\nIt is significantly lower than in the 2019 elections when we had almost 350 voters.\nIt can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.\nThis year we decided to not use the previous voter registration system,\nand we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.\nThis is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nThe last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.\nWith help of many contributors and with the renewed board,\nwe have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,\nfor example hosting contributor summits,\npublishing the public roadmap,\nCode of Conduct update,\nterminology changes,\nand graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.\nThere is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.\n\nIn short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.\n\nThere are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:\nlong-anticipated features and architecture changes,\nchanging the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process,\ncreating better communication channels with Jenkins users,\nand onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to contribute!\n\nFeedback\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe will appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process so that we can improve the process.\nWe have started a Retrospective document for these elections.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\nThere will be also a public retrospective review at the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meeting on Dec 17.\n\nIf you have any private feedback you would like to share,\nplease send an email to the Jenkins Board.\nIf you would like to raise any issues about the election process,\nplease contact one of the elected Governance Board members.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2020 election

that work, I’ve had the great pleasure of helping to organize the Pipeline Authoring Special Interest Group,\ncontributing to the Jenkins Pipeline documentation, and contributing bug fixes to various plugins\n(including the pipeline plugin and workflow-cps library).\n\nAs a Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador,\nI’ve enjoyed doing what I can to advance the community’s approach to CI/CD and simplifying DevSecOps adoption within large organizations.\nIt would be a privilege to serve on the Jenkins Governance Board and offer my support wherever I can.\n\nProfile

process of contributing.\nI even became a Jenkins hero in my city.\nThe most exciting thing I want to do is help more new users of Jenkins get started, and let more contributors feel comfortable.\nI always love to host a JAM no matter if it’s online or offline.\n\nPlans: improve the experience of using Jenkins in different\ncountries; reorganize the knowledge of Jenkins, for example the tutorial\nby text or video format; help other SIG leaders to organize meetings.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: N/A\n\nRelease Officer\n\nBaptiste Mathus\n\nI have been using and contributing to Jenkins for so long that it is difficult for me to check when it started exactly.\nMy first pull-request to Jenkins was in 2011 and I had started to use it long before it.\nThroughout the years, I have contributed to various areas:\ncreated our local Jenkins Area Meetup with Michaël Pailloncy,\nhelped users and developers on our mailing lists and IRC channels,\ncontributed to the Jenkins infrastructure, the website,\nprocessing plugins hosting requests, worked full time on Jenkins Evergreen,\nand I am still present today.\n\nFor all these reasons, it would be an honor to serve as the Release Officer for the Jenkins Project.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nTim Jacomb\n\nI have been a user of Jenkins for the last 8 years and a regular contributor since 2018.\nI began with maintaining the Slack plugin and over the last couple of years I have since expanded that to many more plugins and the Jenkins core.\nThese are some of the components I maintain when I have time: Slack, Azure Key Vault, Junit,\nmost of the Database plugins, Dark theme, Plugin installation manager, Jenkins Helm chart, Configuration as code plugin.\nI am also a member of the Jenkins infrastructure team,\nand I was involved in the release automation project and the mirrors modernisation effort,\nalong with the day to day support helping people regain access to accounts etc.\n\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation,\nease onboarding of new contributors to the release team, and ensure that\nresponsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: Kainos\n\nVictor Martinez\n\nI have been involved in the Jenkins project since 2011 by different means, as a user, as an administrator, as a contributor\n(bug reporting, plugin development, documentation, hackfest),\nbeing active in the different Jenkins forums such as the Jenkins-dev and Jenkins-user mailing lists,\nworking with the jenkins-infra shared library and so on.\nI’m also an advocate for the Jenkins project through some presentations anytime that I had the opportunity such as\nDevOps World 2020 and\nJenkins World 2017.\n\nI’ve been happily nominated for the Release officer role which matches not just my area of professional expertise that\nI’ve been doing for the last 14 years in different roles for different companies but also that’s an area of personal interest\nwhere I’d like to spend time with the Jenkins community to understand, document and automate the process\nin a way we can keep the project sustainable for a long term as it’s today,\nit’s not just about what I can bring for the community but also about growing together.\n\nIf elected as a Release officer I would aim to focus on the following areas:\nproceed with the existing responsibilities for this role;\ndocument and automate the release process;\nbeing an enabler for the Continuous Delivery not just for the plugins but also for the core.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nLinkedIn\n\nAffiliations: Elastic\n\nSecurity Officer - uncontested\n\nDaniel Beck\n\nI’ve been a Jenkins user since 2011, contributor since 2013, and core maintainer since 2014.\nIn 2015, I took on the scheduling and authoring of security advisories and have been doing that ever since,\nworking with reporters, maintainers, and the Jenkins security team to deliver security fixes.\nBeyond that, I regularly contribute to Jenkins and project infrastructure.\n\nSince I’ve started in the Security Officer role, we’ve made significant\nimprovements:\nPlugins no longer allow ordinary users to run arbitrary scripts (no sandbox!) as a regular feature. I introduced fine-grained permission management\nfor our GitHub repositories and\nthe Maven repository hosting our releases.\nWarnings directly in Jenkins inform admins when an installed component has known security issues (and their UX was improved earlier this year).\nThe Jenkins project is now a CVE Numbers Authority,\nto ensure timely and high-quality information in the CVE vulnerability database.\nWorking with Tyler, I added telemetry to Jenkins,\nwhich allowed us to deliver multiple large-scale security fixes with\nminimal impact.\nMore recently, I’ve started writing code scanning rules for common problems in Jenkins and\ninvited maintainers to sign their plugins up,\nwhich is something I hope to properly publish and roll out more widely soon.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nEvents Officer - uncontested\n\nMarky Jackson\n\nI have been a part of the Jenkins community for some time, and I have received the utmost joy in volunteering.\nI have been extremely fortunate to have played a lead role in the Outreach & Advocacy SIG, the pipeline-Authoring SIG,\nand, most recently, the Cloud-Native SIG.\nI have taken part in many meetups, org admin, and mentor in the GSoC & GSoD.\nFinally, At DevOps World 2020, I received Jenkins most valuable advocate at DevOps World.\nI have experience advocating in other communities as well:\nKubernetes Release Manager Associate, Kubernetes Mentoring Lead, Ortelius Community Manager.\n\nJenkins is the most widely used Continuous Integration tool around,\nand I want to continue to promote that by focusing on the following areas: meetups; conference presentation from the Jenkins community;\nnew user outreach and onboarding; cross-community collaboration (e.g., Kubernetes community);\nworking with the Continuous Delivery Foundation on interoperability; focusing on SIG events.\n\nMy roots are open-source, and I am so proud to be a part of the Jenkins community.\nYou can read more about my journey in open-source here.\nYou can also see some of my presentations here and\nhere.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nLinkedIn,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: OpsMx, Continuous Delivery Foundation, Kubernetes, Ortelius, Spinnaker\n\nInfrastructure Officer - uncontested\n\nOlivier Vernin\n\nI have been actively contributing to the Jenkins project for the past four years with contributions across many areas,\nand infrastructure is one of my favorite topics.\nOver my previous mandate as a Jenkins infrastructure officer, I focused on improving contribution experience,\nand let community members opportunities to take ownership of the different services.\nI worked on various sponsoring initiatives to make the Jenkins infrastructure more sustainable.\nWe provided a new environment for releasing Jenkins core (and one plugin!), and also many more things.\n\nFor the coming year, It is hard to make commitments on what it will look like as we have things we know,\nlike services that need some attention (“ci.jenkins.io/) and the things we don’t know yet.\nAnyway, It’s important to me to have a transparent project where everybody could read, learn, participate,\nand understand how the Jenkins project manages infrastructure and I want to continue down that path.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nDocumentation Officer - uncontested\n\nMark Waite\n\nI’m a Jenkins contributor, a member of the Jenkins core team, one of the leaders of the Platform Special Interest Group,\nand leader of the Documentation Special Interest Group.\nI’ve served as the Jenkins Documentation Officer since 2019.\nI was a mentor for Google Season of Code 2020 and am one of the maintainers of the Git plugin for Jenkins.\n\nIf elected and allowed to serve as Documentation Officer,\nI’ll continue efforts to invite more contributors through regular Documentation Office Hours and outreach programs like Google Season of Docs, CommunityBridge, Outreachy, and Jenkins Hackfests.\nI’ll work to assure an inviting and welcoming environment for contributors.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nLinkedIn,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nMore information\n\nJenkins 2020 elections announcement\n\nJenkins Governance Board and Jenkins Officers\n\nJenkins Board and Officer Election Process\n\n2019 election results\n\nElections coordination in the mailing list","title":"2020 Elections: Governance Board and Officer candidates","tags":["community","governance","governance-board","elections"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/author/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ce6df408-6cd5-5276-88d1-f05a7d26b213","slug":"/blog/2020/09/24/board-elections/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins 2020 Elections are over, thanks to all participants!\nPlease see the results announcement.\n\nWe are happy to announce the 2020 elections in the Jenkins project!\nNominations are open for two governance board and for all five officer positions,\nnamely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation.\nThe board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being.\nWe invite Jenkins contributors and community members to sign-up for elections and to nominate contributors for the elected roles.\nDeadline for nominations is Oct 15, voter registration ends on Nov 02.\n\nThese are the second elections held by the Jenkins project.\nDuring the 2019 elections, we elected 3 board members and 5 officers.\nYou can find the voting results here.\nThis year, we decided to make a few changes in the election process based on the 2019 elections feedback.\n\nKey dates\n\nSep 24 - Nominations open, voting sign-up begins.\n\nOct 15 - Board and officer nominations deadline.\n\nOct 26 (or later) - List of candidates is published, including personal statements.\n\nNov 10 - Voting begins.
