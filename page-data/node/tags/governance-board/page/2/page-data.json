Rick to many of you)\n\nVoter Registration\n\nThis is the first time in a while that we are running a Jenkins election; we are learning as we go.\nJenkins elections aim to be very inclusive.\nWe do not restrict elections to just code committers.\nAnyone who has a Jenkins account registered before September 1, 2019 is eligible to vote.\nJenkins, being the successful project it is, has  approximately 100 000 accounts that meet that criteria.\nAs a result we are contacting eligible voters and requesting that they explicitly ‘opt-in’ to participate in the voting.\n\nIf you meet the criteria, you will receive an email at your registered jenkins.io email address.\nIt will be from elections@jenkins.io with the title ‘ 2019 Jenkins Election - Invitation to Participate ’.\nThe email will provide election details and will include an \" I want to participate\" button.\n\nVoter Confirmation\n\nOnce you click on the link, you should see a confirmation screen as follows:\n\nIf you do not receive the email by November 14, 2019 or if you have any problems voting, please comment on the Jenkins Election 2019 Jira issue.\n\nVoting\n\nThe voting will officially open on November 11, 2019.\nCandidates will receive an email from the Condorcet internet voting sent by Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\nOne email will be sent for each vote (so 3 in total: 1 for board, 1 for event officer and 1 for security officer).\nThe vote will ask to rank the candidates using a screen like this:\n\nElection Dates\n\nHere is a summary of the key election dates:\n\nDate\nEvent\n\nNow\nVoter registration ongoing\n\nNov 11, 2019\nVoting begins\n\nNov 17, 2019\nVoter registration closes\n\nNov 24, 2019\nVoting closes a 5:00 PM Pacific Time\n\nDec 3, 2019\nNew representatives announced\n\nElection results will be posted to the Jenkins developer mailing list, followed by an announcement blog post on jenkins.io.\n\nIf there are any delays to the proposed dates we will aim to communicate that as soon as we can.\nThank you very much for all the candidates showing the Jenkins spirit of service to their community.\nWe encourage everyone to register to vote and participate in the Jenkins community.\n\nUncontested Officer Positions\n\nWhen an officer position has only one candidate that is willing to accept the nomination, there is no reason to vote on that position.\nThe individual becomes an officer as the sole candidate for the position.\n\nUncontested officers include:\n\nName\nRole\n\nOlivier Vernin\nInfrastructure Officer\n\nOliver Gondza\nRelease Officer\n\nMark Waite\nDocumentation Officer\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\nAnnouncement in the developer mailing list\n\n2019 elections proposal in
