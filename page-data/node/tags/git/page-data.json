If you’d like to skip the journey part, you can directly go to the [major performance improvements] section and the [minor performance section] to see what we’ve done!\n\nJourney to release\n\nThe project started with deciding to choose a git operation and then trying to compare the performance of that operation by using command line git and then with JGit.\n\nStage 1: Benchmark results with git fetch\n\nThe performance of git fetch (average execution time/op) is strongly correlated to the size of a repository\n\nThere exists an inflection point on the scale of repository size after which the nature of JGit performance changes (it starts to degrade)\n\nAfter running multiple benchmarks, it is safe to say that for a large sized repository command line git would be a better choice of implementation.\n\nWe can use this insight to implement a feature which avoids JGit with large repositories.\n\nStage 2: Comparing platforms\n\nThe project was also concerned that there might be important differences between operating systems.\nFor example, what if command line Git for Windows performed very differently than command line Git on Linux or FreeBSD?\nBenchmarks were run to compare fetch performance on several platforms.\n\nRunning git fetch operation for a 400 MiB sized repository on:\n\nAMD64 Microsoft Winders\n\nAMD64 FreeBSD\n\nIBM PowerPC 64 LE Ubuntu 18\n\nIBM System 390 Ubuntu 18\n\nThe result of running this experiment is given below:\n\nThe difference in performance between git and JGit remains constant across all platforms.\n\nBenchmark results on one platform are applicable to all platforms.\n\nStage 3: Performance of git fetch and repository structure\n\nThe area of the circle enclosing each parameter signifies the strength of the positive correlation between the performance of a git fetch operation and that parameter. From the diagram:\n\nSize of the aggregated objects is the dominant player in determining the execution time for a git fetch\n\nNumber of branches and Number of tags play a similar role but are strongly overshadowed by size of repository\n\nNumber of commits has a negligible effect on the performance of running git fetch\n\nAfter running these experiments from Stage-1 to Stage-3, we developed a solution called the GitToolChooser which is explained in the next stage\n\nStage 4: Faster checkout with Git tool chooser\n\nThis feature takes the responsibility of choosing the optimal implementation from the user and hands it to the plugin. It takes the decision of recommending an implementation on the basis of the size of the repository. Here is how it works.\n\nThe image above depicts the performance enhancements we have performed over the course of the GSoC project. These improvements have enabled the checkout step to be finished within half of what it used to take earlier in some cases.\n\nLet’s talk about performance improvements in two parts.\n\nMajor performance improvements\n\nBuilding Tensorflow (~800 MiB) using a Jenkins pipeline, there is over 50% reduction in overall time spent in completing a job!\nThe result is consistent multiple platforms.\n\nThe reason for such a decrease is the fact that JGit degrades in performance when we are talking about large sized repositories. Since the GitToolChooser is aware of this fact, it chooses to recommend command line git instead which saves the user some time.\n\nMinor performance improvements\n\nNote: Enable JGit before using the new performance features to let GitToolChooser work with more options → Here’s how\n\nBuilding the git plugin (~ 20 MiB) using a Jenkins pipeline, there is a drop of a second across all platforms when performance enhancement is enabled. Also, eliminating a redundant fetch reduces unnecessary load on git servers.\n\nThe reason for this change is the fact that JGit performs better than command line git for small sized repositories (<50MiB) as an already warmed up JVM favors the native Java implementation.\n\nReleases\n\nGit Plugin 4.4.0\n\nAdd GitToolChooser\n\nRemove redundant fetch\n\nGit Client Plugin 3.4.0\n\nAdd support to communicate compatibility of JGit with certain additional SCM behaviors\n\nThe road ahead\n\nSupport from other branch source plugins\n\nPlugins like the GitHub Branch Source Plugin or GitLab Branch Source Plugin need to extend an extension point provided by the git plugin to facilitate the exchange of information related to size of a remote repository hosted by the particular git provider\n\nJENKINS-63519 : GitToolChooser predicts the wrong implementation\n\nAddition of this feature to GitSCMSource\n\nDetection of lock related delays accessing the cache directories present on the controller\n\nThis issue was reported by the plugin maintainer Mark Waite, there is a need to reproduce the issue first and then find a possible solution.\n\nReaching out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions or feedback on the project’s\nGitter Channel or the\nJenkins Developer Mailing list.\nReport an issue at Jenkins Jira.\n\nUseful Links\n\nPhase 1 Blog: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/07/09/git-performance-improvement-phase1/\n\nPhase 2 Blog: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/07/29/git-performance-improvement-phase2/\n\nProject Page: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/git-plugin-performance/\n\nDemonstration","title":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement: Final Phase and Release","tags":["plugins","git","platform-sig","developer","performance","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"rishabhBudhouliya","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2020 student under the Jenkins project (Git Plugin Performance Improvements).\nAspiring to be better at Software Development and participate more in the open source\ncommunity.</p>\n</div>","id":"rishabhbudhouliya","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rishabh Budhouliya","slug":"blog/author/rishabhbudhouliya","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","id":"84676949-9b05-55b1-b843-435c0ff0696d","slug":"/blog/2020/07/29/git-performance-improvement-phase2/","strippedHtml":"The second phase of the Git Plugin Performance Improvement project has been great in terms of the progress we have achieved in implementing performance improvement insights\nderived from the phase one JMH micro-benchmark experiments.\n\nWhat we’ve learned so far in this project is that a git fetch is highly correlated to the size of the remote repository. In order to make fetch improvements in this plugin, our task was to find the difference in performance for the two available git implementations in the Git Plugin, git and JGit.\n\nOur major finding was that git performs much better than JGit when it comes to a large sized repository (>100 MiB). Interestingly, JGit performs better than git when size of the repository is less than 100 MiB.\n\nIn this phase, we were successful in coding this derived knowledge from the benchmarks into a new functionality called the\nGitToolChooser.\n\nGitToolChooser\n\nThis class aims to add the functionality of recommending a git implementation on the basis of the size of a repository which has a strong correlation to the performance of git fetch (from performance Benchmarks).\n\nIt utilizes two heuristics to calculate the size:\n\nUsing cached .git dir from multibranch projects to estimate the size of a repository\n\nProviding an extension point which, upon implementation, can use REST APIs exposed by git service providers like Github, GitLab, etc to fetch the size of the remote repository.\n\nWill it optimize your Jenkins instance?\nThat requires one of the following:\n\nyou have a multibranch project in your Jenkins instance, the plugin can use that to recommend the optimal git implementation\n\nyou have a branch Source Plugin installed in the Jenkins instance, the particular branch source plugin will recommend a git implementation using REST APIs provided by GitHub or GitLab respectively.\n\nThe architecture and code for this class is at: PR-931\n\nNote : This functionality is an upcoming feature in the subsequent Git Plugin release.\n\nJMH benchmarks in multiple environments\n\nThe benchmarks were being executed on Linux and macOS machines frequently but there was a need to check if the results gained from those benchmarks would hold true across more platforms to ensure that the solution (GitToolChooser) is generally platform-agnostic.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we performed an experiment:\n\nRunning git fetch operation for a 400 MiB sized repository on:\n\nWindows\n\nFreeBSD 12\n\nppc64le\n\ns390x\n\nThe result of running this experiment is given below:\n\nObservations:\n\nppc64le and s390x are able to run the operation in almost half the time it takes for the Windows or FreeBSD 12 machine. This behavior may be attributed to the increased computational power of those machines.\n\nThe difference in performance between git and JGit remains constant across all platforms which is a positive sign for the GitToolChooser as its recommendation would be consistent across multiple devices and operating systems.\n\nRelease Plan 🚀\n\nJENKINS-49757 - Avoid double fetch from Git checkout step\nThis issue was fixed in phase one, avoids the second fetch in redundant cases.\nIt will be shipped with some benchmarks on the change in performance due to the removal of the second fetch.\n\nPR-574\n\nPR-904\n\nGitToolChooser\n\nPR-931\nThis pull request is under review, will be shipped in one of the subsequent Git Plugin releases.\n\nCurrent Challenges with GitToolChooser\n\nImplement the extension point to support GitHub Branch Source Plugin, Gitlab Branch Source Plugin and Gitea Plugin.\n\nThe current version of JGit doesn’t support LFS checkout and sparse checkout, need to make sure that the recommendation doesn’t break existing use cases.\n\nFuture Work\n\nIn phase three, we wish to:\n\nRelease a new version of the Git and Git Client Plugin with the features developed during the project\n\nContinue to explore more areas for performance improvement\n\nAdd a new git operation: git clone (Stretch Goal)\n\nReaching Out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions or feedback on the project’s Gitter Channel or the Jenkins\nDeveloper Mailing list.\n\nProject Page\n\nPhase 1 Blog Post","title":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement Phase-2 Progress","tags":["plugins","git","platform-sig","developer","performance","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"rishabhBudhouliya","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2020 student under the Jenkins project (Git Plugin Performance Improvements).\nAspiring to be better at Software Development and participate more in the open source\ncommunity.</p>\n</div>","id":"rishabhbudhouliya","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rishabh Budhouliya","slug":"blog/author/rishabhbudhouliya","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"615c1ac2-c3da-5001-be28-908ac6008d94","slug":"/blog/2020/07/09/git-performance-improvement-phase1/","strippedHtml":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement is a Google Summer of Code 2020 project.\nIt aims to improve the performance of the git plugin, which provides fundamental git functionalities.\n\nInternally, the plugin provides these functionalities using two implementations: command line git and JGit (pure java implementation).\n\nCLI git is the default implementation for the plugin, a user can switch to JGit if needed\n\nThe project is divided into two parallel stages:\n\nStage 1 : Create benchmarks which evaluate the execution time of a git operation provided by CLI git and JGit using JMH, a micro benchmarking test harness.\n\nStage 2 : Implement the insights gained from the analysis into the plugin to improve the overall performance of the plugin.\n\nThe project also aims to fix any existing performance bottlenecks within the plugin as well.\n\nBenchmarks\n\nThe benchmarks are written using JMH.

The immutable nature of releases\nand the immutable nature of tags can definitely go hand in hand, but up until\nfew months ago Jenkins Pipeline was not able to trigger effectively off of Git\ntags.\n\nIn this post I want to briefly share how to use tags to drive behaviors in\nJenkins Pipeline. Consider the following contrived Jenkinsfile, which\ncontains the three basic stages of Build, Test, and Deploy:\n\npipeline {\n    agent any\n    stages {\n        stage('Build') {\n            steps {\n                sh 'make package'\n            }\n        }\n        stage('Test') {\n            steps {\n                sh 'make check'\n            }\n        }\n        stage('Deploy') {\n            when { tag \"release-*\" }\n            steps {\n                echo 'Deploying only because this commit is tagged...'\n                sh 'make deploy'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nOf particular note is the\nwhen\ncondition on the \"Deploy\" stage which is applying the tag criteria. This\nmeans the stage would only execute when the Pipeline has been triggered from a\ntag in Git matching the release-* Ant-style wildcard.\n\nIn practice, this means that all pull requests, and branch-based Pipeline Runs\nresult in the stage being skipped:\n\nWhen I push a release-1.0 tag, the Pipeline will then be triggerd and run the\n\"Deploy\" stage:\n\nOut of the box, Pipelines won’t trigger off of the presence of tags, which\nmeans that a Multibranch Pipeline must have a configuration update to know that\nit must Discover Tags.\n\nConfiguring\n\nFrom the configuration screen of a Multibranch Pipeline (or GitHub Organization\nFolder), Discovering tags can be enabled by adding the appropriate \"Behavior\"\nto the Branch Source configuration:\n\nWith these changes, the Jenkinsfile in the tagged versions of my source\nrepository can now drive distinct deployment behavior which is not otherwise\nenabled in the Pipeline.","title":"When using tags in Jenkins Pipeline","tags":["pipeline","git"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
