You can learn more about this policy and our processes on our\nsecurity page.","title":"Addressing recently disclosed vulnerabilities in the Jenkins CLI","tags":["security","lts"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a5b6f4b0-0b11-53a8-a751-ef9f1b23e787","slug":"/blog/2016/07/14/2-7-1-re-release/","strippedHtml":"We created new native packages for Jenkins 2.7.1 today. These replace the existing packages. Due to a release process issue, the packaging (RPM, etc.) was created the same way as Jenkins 1.x LTS, resulting in problems starting Jenkins on some platforms: While we dropped support for AJP in Jenkins 2.0, some 1.x packages had it enabled by default, resulting in an exception during startup.\n\nThese new packages for Jenkins 2.7.1, dated July 14, have the same scripts and parameters as Jenkins 2.x and should allow starting up Jenkins without problems.

The 2.x versions since then has been adopted by more than 20% of the users, but one segment of users who haven’t seen the benefits of Jenkins 2 is those who has been running LTS releases.\n\nBut that is no more! The new version of Jenkins LTS release we just released is 2.7.1, and now LTS users get to finally enjoy Jenkins 2.\n\nThis release also officially marks the end-of-life for Jenkins 1.x. There won’t be any future release of Jenkins 1.x beyond this point. If you are worried about the upgrade, don’t be!

This is based on the current LTS (and will be kept up to date with the LTS) - but does not include the weekly releases (yet). Having a jenkins image that is fairly basic (it includes enough to run some basic builds, as well as jenkins itself) built on the LTS, on the latest LTS of Ubuntu seemed quite convenient - and easy to maintain using the official Ubuntu/Debian packaging of Jenkins.\n\n+\n\n+\nDocker is a great way to try and use server based systems - it brings all the dependencies needed and the images actually are portable (ie anywhere docker runs you can run docker images). There are official images for many popular server platforms (redis, mysql, all the linux distros and so on) so it seemed crazy to not include Jenkins along with this list. +\n\"docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins\" is all you need to get going with LTS Jenkins now. +\nYou can also use \"docker run jenkins:1.554\" to get the latest of that lineage of LTS releases, or pick a specific one: \"docker run jenkins:1.554.3\" if you like. Leaving off a version assumes the latest. Check the https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/tags/manage/[tags] page to see what is available. +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nYou can read more and see how you https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/[can use it here.] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThere has been some questions and discussions on how to make use of Jenkins with the docker hub for creating new and interesting docker image based workflows for deployment. +\nIn fact, Jenkins featured in one of the first slides of the first keynote of docker con: +\n +\nimage:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qAC-f6ceVho/U5rfqpzj3VI/AAAAAAAAC8w/Ta4pzEhm-8A/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-06-13+at+8.34.10+pm.png[image] +\n +\nTo make this dream a reality some additional https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/DockerHub+Plugin[plugins] had to be created - but this leaves the possibility of working with the docker hub (builds, stores images) and Jenkins (workflow, testing, deployment) to build out some kind of a continuous pipeline for handling docker based apps. I attempted to describe this more https://developer-blog.cloudbees.com/2014/07/announcing-dockerhub-jenkins-plugin.html[here]. +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThis image is maintained in this github https://github.com/cloudbees/jenkins-ci.org-docker[repo] and the official images are build by the https://github.com/docker/stackbrew[\"stackbrew\" system].
