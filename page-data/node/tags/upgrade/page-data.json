Token usage tracking\n\nYou can revoke API tokens.\nWhen you know that you are not using a given token anymore, you can revoke it to reduce the risk of it getting used by unauthorized users.\nSince you can have multiple API tokens, this allows fine-grained control over which scripts, hosts, or applications are allowed to use Jenkins as a given user.\n\nMigrating to new API tokens\n\nTo help administrators migrate their instances progressively, the legacy behavior is still available, while new system is also usable.\n\nOn the user configuration page, the legacy token is highlighted with a warning sign,\nexplaining that users should revoke it and generate a new one (if needed) to increase security.\n\nFigure 2. Legacy token renewal still possible\n\nNew options for administrators\n\nIn order to let administrators control the pace of migration to the new API token system,\nwe added two global configuration options in the \"Configure Global Security\" page in the brand new \"API Token\" section:\n\nAn option to disable the creation of legacy API tokens on user creation.\n\nAn option to disable the recreation of legacy API tokens by users, forcing them to only use the new, unrecoverable API tokens.\n\nBoth options are disabled by default for new installations (the safe default), while they’re enabled when Jenkins is upgraded from before 2.129.\n\nFigure 3. Security Configuration options\n\nFigure 4. Remove legacy token and disable the re-creation\n\nNew administrator warnings\n\nWhen upgrading to Jenkins 2.129, an administrative monitor informs admins about the new options described above, and recommend disabling them.\n\nAnother administrative warnings shows up if at least one user still has a legacy API token.\nIt provides central control over legacy tokens still configured in the Jenkins instance, and allows revoking them all.\n\nFigure 5. Legacy token monitoring page\n\nSummary\n\nJenkins API tokens are now much more flexible: They allow and even encourage better security practices.\nWe recommend you revoke legacy API tokens as soon as you can, and only use the newly introduced API tokens.","title":"Security Hardening: New API token system in Jenkins

is a post about a major change in Jenkins, which is available starting\nfrom Jenkins 2.102 and Jenkins LTS 2.107.1.\nThis is a change with a serious risk of regressions in plugins.\nIf you are a Jenkins administrator, please read this blogpost and\nupgrade guidelines\nBEFORE upgrading.\n\nI would like to provide some heads-up about the\nJEP-200 change,\nwhich is included into the new Jenkins LTS 2.107.x baseline.\n\nBackground\n\nFor many years Jenkins used to specifically blacklist certain classes and packages according to known or suspected exploits.\nThis approach has been proven unsustainable due to the risk of deserialization attacks via unknown classes\nfrom 3rd-party components, after the\nSECURITY-429/CVE-2017-1000353 fix in 2.46.2\nit was decided to replace blacklists by more restrictive whitelists.\nIn October 2017 Jesse Glick proposed a Jenkins Enhancement Proposal,\nwhich finally got accepted as JEP-200.\n\nThe change implies a risk of regressions in plugins serializing non-whitelisted Java-internal and 3rd-party classes,\nand that’s why it is so important to follow the upgrade guidelines for this release.\n\nCurrent state\n\nJEP-200 was first integrated in Jenkins 2.102 (released in January 2018), and it has got a lot of testing since that.\nSee this blogpost for the original announcement.\n\nOver the last two months we received more than 75 issues from users of Jenkins weekly releases.\nAll these issues have been triaged, and we have released most of the fixes.\nMore than 50 plugins were fixed in total, and many more plugins were updated in order to enable compatibility testing.\nA significant part of the discovered regressions were caused by real defects which were causing performance and stability\nissues in plugins.\nThanks a lot to all the Jenkins contributors and plugin maintainers who helped deliver timely changes for this effort!\n\nOver last 6 weeks Jenkins weekly releases had positive community ratings,\nthe overall JEP-200 adoption reached ~12% of all Jenkins installations on March 01.\nAll major plugins have been also tested directly or verified in the wild on weekly releases.\nSo we are confident that the change is ready to be released in LTS.\n\nOn the other hand, we continue to receive JEP-200 regression reports.\nThey are mostly caused by niche plugins which are not widely used in weekly releases,\nand unfortunately not all fixes have been released yet (see the Wiki page for up-to-date info).\nWe anticipate more regressions to be reported after the LTS release and broader adoption.\n\nIn order to simplify the upgrade to the new LTS baseline,\nI have prepared some helpful materials together with Liam Newman\nand Jesse Glick.\nBelow you can find the embedded slide deck and video, or scroll down to see the key information\nin the text form.\n\nVideo:\n\nFor Jenkins administrators\n\nUpgrading to a core with JEP-200 requires a special update procedure, which is described below.\n\nUpgrading Jenkins\n\nJEP-200 is not the only major change in 2.107.1, please read\nthe full upgrade guide carefully\n\nIf you have a way of testing the upgrade before applying it to production, do it\n\nBack up your instance so you have any easy way of rolling back\n\nUpdate all affected plugins.\nSee this Wiki page for the list of affected plugins,\nfix statuses and workarounds\n\nApply workarounds for non-released patches if needed (see below)\n\nUpdate to the new version of the Jenkins core\n\nUsing backups and staging servers is good advice before any upgrade but especially this one,\ngiven the relatively high risk of regression.\nDue to the nature of the changes, some plugins may refuse to load after the upgrade and cause your Jenkins service to fail to start.\n\nAfter the upgrade\n\nTo the extent that advance testing of the impact of this change on popular plugins has been completed,\nmost users (and even plugin developers) should not notice any difference.\nStill, it is highly advised to monitor your system after the upgrade, especially the following:\n\nJenkins System log (especially during the startup)\n\nJob/Build logs\n\nIf you do encounter a log message referencing the https://jenkins.io/redirect/class-filter/ URL,\nmost likely it is a JEP-200 regression.\nExample:\n\nsome.pkg.and.ClassName in file:/var/lib/jenkins/plugins/some-plugin-name/WEB-INF/lib/some-library-1.2.jar might be dangerous, so rejecting; see https://jenkins.io/redirect/class-filter/\n\nIf you see this kind of message, we highly recommend reporting it so that it can be investigated and probably fixed quickly.\n\nReporting JEP-200 issues\n\nStarting from May 01, JEP-200 issues are triaged by plugin and core maintainers.\nJEP-200 maintainers are available for code reviews if needed,\nbut they will not be reviewing cases in JIRA and searching for miscategorized issues on a daily basis.\nIf you experience new JEP-200 regressions, please follow the guidelines below.\n\nPlease report any issues you encounter matching the above pattern in the\nJenkins issue tracker, under the appropriate plugin component.\nBefore reporting please check whether this issue has already been reported.\n\nAdd the JEP-200 label\n\nInclude the stacktrace you see in the log\n\nIf possible, include complete steps to reproduce the problem from scratch\n\nYou can find examples of previously reported issues using this query.\n\nJenkins developers will evaluate issues and strive to offer a fix in the form of a core and/or plugin update.\nRight after the feature release there was be a special team triaging the reports.\nStarting from May 01 the issues will be triaged by plugin and core maintainers.\nSee JEP-200 Maintenance plan for more info.\n\nFor more details and current status, see\nPlugins affected by fix for JEP-200.\n\nApplying workarounds\n\nAssuming you see no particular reason to think that the class in question has dangerous deserialization semantics, which is rare,\nit is possible to work around the problem in your own installation as a temporary expedient.\nNote the class name(s) mentioned in the JEP-200 log messages,\nand run Jenkins with the hudson.remoting.ClassFilter startup option, e.g.:\n\njava -Dhudson.remoting.ClassFilter=some.pkg.and.ClassName,some.pkg.and.OtherClassName -jar jenkins.war ...\n\nThis workaround process may require several iterations, because classes whitelisted in the workaround may also\ninclude fields with types requiring whitelisting.\n\nFor plugin developers\n\nIf you are a plugin developer, please see the original JEP-200 announcement.\nThat blog post provides guidelines for testing and fixing plugin compatibility after the JEP-200 changes.\nThe presentation above also provides some information about what needs to be tested.","title":"Security hardening:

In many cases update to JNLP4 was a resolution\n\nJNLP1/JNLP2/CLI1 are unencrypted, and it is not something Jenkins users may expect in 2017\n\nIt is tracked as JENKINS-45841 in Jenkins JIRA.\n\nHow?\n\nWhen Jenkins is started in the new installation mode with enabled Installation Wizard, old protocols will be disabled\n\nJenkins shows an administrative warning when obsolete protocols are enabled\n\nCompatibility notes\n\nOlder instances won’t be affected by the disabling of the older JNLP1/JNLP2 protocols, which will still be enabled for them.\nNewly created instances which skip, or disable, the Setup Wizard will not be affected either.\n\n\"New\" Jenkins instances installed via setup wizard may be affected in edge cases. For example:\n\nAgents with Remoting older than 3.0 will be unable to connect.\n\nMitigation: Before updating make sure Remoting is not bundled custom Docker images, AMIs, etc.\n\nSwarm Plugin: old versions of Swarm Client (before 3.3) will be unable to connect to Jenkins, because Remoting 2.x is bundled\n\nMitigation : Update Swarm Client\n\nVery old jenkins-cli.jar without CLI2 support will be unable to connect.\n\nMitigation : Do not use Remoting-based CLI on new instances (see this blogpost)\n\nUpgrade to Java 8\n\nStarting with version 2.54, Jenkins requires Java 8 to run\n( announcement blog post).\nThis version is also required for Jenkins LTS 2.60.1.\n\nRemoting continued to support Java 7 for a while for backporting purposes,\nbut it will be also upgraded to Java 8 in the Remoting 3.11 release.\nThis Rremoting version is expected to be available in Jenkins 2.75 (ETA: Aug 20, 2017).\nThis change is tracked as JENKINS-43985.\n\nCompatibility notes\n\nThe update does not cause compatibility issues in common use-cases.\nHowever, there may be issues in custom Jenkins core builds and packaging.\nThere are several examples below.\n\nJenkins instances with built-in Remoting versions will NOT be affected, Java 8 is already required there\n\nUsers of community-provided Docker packages ( docker-agent,\ndocker-inbound-agent) will NOT be affected,\nJava 8 is already required there\n\nCustom Jenkins WAR file builds targeting Java 7 may fail to build/run if they bundle Remoting 3.11 or later\n\nCustom Jenkins agent instances (manually installed hosts, VM snapshots, Docker packages, AMIs, etc.) may fail if they download the latest Remoting version and use Java 7\n\nJava 9 support\n\nAs with Jenkins core, Java 9 not supported and not tested in Remoting.\nIt may work in some configurations, but it is not guaranteed.\n\nAs a consequence, it is not recommended to run Remoting with Java 9 right now.\nIt is also not recommended to use Maven Integration Plugin to run builds on Java 9.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThere are some ongoing activities in the Remoting sub-project:\n\nStability and Diagnosability improvements\n( JENKINS-38833)\n\nWhy? When it comes to Remoting issues, it is really hard to diagnose them\n\nRecently I have published some slides about preventing and diagnosing issues, but I want the behavior to be more stable by default\n\nThis Epic lists my plans about Remoting issues and papercuts I would like to fix this year\n\nRemoting Work Directories\n( JENKINS-44108)\n\nFor a long time logging was disabled by default in Java Web Start (JNLP) and SSH agents, because Remoting had no option to determine where to store such data before connecting to the controller\n\nThe new Remoting Work Directory feature (since Remoting 3.8) offers such storage, which is also used for storing JAR caches and for checking workspace writeability before accepting builds.\n\nThis Epic is about enabling Remoting work directories by default in common Agent launcher types.\n\nRemoting Upgradeability\n( JENKINS-44099)\n\nRight now Remoting is not being upgraded automatically on JNLP agents, it is supported only for Windows service agents starting from Jenkins 2.50\n\nOn the Jenkins controller side it is required to upgrade the Jenkins core in order to pick Remoting fixes.\n\nThis Epic aims simplifying the upgrade procedure for most common cases.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to these tasks, or others in the Remoting\nsub-project, please feel free to reach out via the issue tracker or\n#jenkins IRC channel.\n\nIf you are coming to Jenkins World, you can also find me at the \"Ask the Experts\" booth there.\nSee more info about Ask the Experts here.\n\nUseful links\n\nRemoting Sub-Project on Jenkins website\n\nRemoting Release Notes\n\nRemoting documentation on GitHub\n\nMy slides about Remoting issues troubleshooting","title":"Remoting Update.

the next few months, Jenkins will require Java 8 as its runtime.\n\nBack in\nlast November,\nwe discussed interesting statistics showing that Jenkins was now running Java 8\non a majority of its running instances.\n\nTimeline\n\nHere is how we plan to roll that baseline upgrade in the next few months.\n\nNow: Announce the intention publicly.\n\nApril, 2017: Drop support for Java 7 in Jenkins weekly.\nWith the current rhythm, that means 2.52 will most likely be the first weekly to require Java 8.\n\nJune 2017: First LTS version requiring Java 8 is published.\nThis should be something around 2.60.1.\n\nIf you are still running Java 7, you will not be able to upgrade to the latest LTS version after some date probably around May 2017.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 8\n\nBalancing those numbers with many other criteria:\n\nJava 7 has been now end-of-lifed for 18+ months\n\nPeople are already moving away from Java 7, as show the numbers\n\n52.8% of instances were already running Java 8 back in last November, and now reaching 58% two months later.\n\nIf we only look at Jenkins 2.x, then we reach 72%.\n\nJava 8 runtime is known from the field to be more stable\n\nMany developers have been wanting to be allowed to leverage the improvements that Java 8 provides to the language and platform\n(lambdas, Date/Time API…​ just to name a few).\nBeing also a developer community, we want Jenkins to be appealing to contributors.\n\nIf you have questions or feedback about this announcement, please feel free to post it to the Jenkins developers mailing list.","title":"Jenkins
