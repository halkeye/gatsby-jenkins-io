another great phase for the\nExternal Fingerprint Storage Project\ncomes to an end, we summarise the work done during this phase in this blog post.\nIt was an exciting and fruitful journey, just like the previous phase, and offered some great learning experience.\n\nTo understand what the project is about and the past progress, please refer to the\nphase 1 blog post.\n\nNew Stories Completed\n\nWe targeted four stories in this phase, namely fingerprint cleanup, fingerprint migration, refactoring the current\nimplementation to use descriptors, and improved testing of the Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin.\nWe explain these stories in detail below.\n\nFingerprint Cleanup\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4817\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/23\n\nThis story involved extending the FingerprintStorage API to allow external storage plugins to perform and configure\ntheir own fingerprint cleanup strategies.\nWe added the following functionalities to Jenkins core API:\n\nFingerprintStorage#iterateAndCleanupFingerprints(TaskListener taskListener)\n\nThis allows external fingerprint storage implementations to implement their own custom fingerprint cleanup.\nThe method is called periodically by Jenkins core.\n\nFingerprintStorage#cleanFingerprint(Fingerprint fingerprint, TaskListener taskListener)\n\nThis is a reference implementation which can be called by external storage plugins to clean up a fingerprint.\nIt is upto the plugin implementation to decide whether to use this method.\nThey may choose to write a custom implementation.\n\nWe consume these new API functionalities in the\nRedis Fingerprint Storage plugin.\nThe plugin uses cursors to traverse the fingerprints, updating the build information, and deleting the build-less\nfingerprints.\n\nEarlier, fingerprint cleanup was always run periodically and there was no way to turn it off.\nWe also added an option to allow the user to turn off fingerprint cleanup.\n\nThis was done because it may be the case that keeping redundant fingerprints in memory might be cheaper than the\ncleanup operation (especially in the case of external storages, which are cheaper these days).\n\nFingerprint Migration\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4825\n\nEarlier, there was no support for fingerprints stored in the local storage.\nIn this phase, we introduce migration support for users.\nThe old fingerprints are now migrated to the new configured external storage whenever they are used (lazy migration).\nThis allows gradual migration of old fingerprints from local disk storage to the new external storage.\n\nRefactor FingerprintStorage to use descriptors\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4834\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/36\n\nEarlier, whenever an external fingerprint storage plugin was installed, it was enabled by default.\nWe refactored the implementation to make use of Descriptor pattern so the fingerprint engine can now be selected\nas a dropdown from the Jenkins configuration page.\nThe dropdown is shown only when multiple fingerprint storage engines are configured on the system.\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin was refactored\nto use this new implementation.\n\nStrengthened testing for the Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/33\n\nWe introduced new connection tests in the\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin.\nThese tests allow testing of cases like slow connection, breakage of connection to Redis, etc.\nThese were implemented using the Toxiproxy module inside Testcontainers.\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/31\n\nWe introduced test for Configuration-as-code (JCasC) compatibility with the plugin.\nThe documentation for configuring the plugin using JCasC was also added.\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/39\n\nWe introduced a suite of authentication tests, to verify the proper working of the Redis authentication system.\nAuthentication uses the credentials plugin.\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/32\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin/pull/36\n\nWe strengthened our web UI testing to ensure that the configuration page for the plugin works properly as planned.\n\nOther miscellaneous tasks\n\nPlease refer to the Jira Epic for this phase.\n\nReleases 🚀\n\nChanges in the Jenkins core (except migration) were released in Jenkins 2.248.\n\nWe drafted 1.0-rc-1\nrelease for the Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\nto deliver the changes.\nThis was an increment from the alpha release\nwe had drafted at the end of the previous phase.\nThe plugin is now available at https://plugins.jenkins.io/redis-fingerprint-storage/!\n\nTrying out the new features!\n\nThe latest release for the plugin can be downloaded from the update center, instructions for which can be\nfound in the README\nof the plugin.\nWe appreciate you trying out the plugin, and welcome any suggestions, feature requests, bug reports, etc.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe Redis Fingerprint Storage plugin is built and maintained by the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Team for\nExternal Fingerprint Storage for\nJenkins.

GitHub Check Run Screenshot from GitHub Docs\n\nWhat’s more exciting is that it can leave annotations on specific lines of code, just as the comments people left while reviewing.\n\nFigure 2.

Source Code View from Warnings Next Generation Plugin\n\nUtilizing such features through GitHub Checks API, it would make Jenkins more convenient to GitHub users.\n\nFeatures from Coding Phase 1\n\nIn the past month, our team was mostly working on the general checks API and an implementation for GitHub checks API.\n\nGitHub Checks API Plugin Demo [starts from 50:15]\n\nGeneral Checks API\n\nAlthough the general checks API is developed based on the semantic meaning of GitHub Checks API, we still want to prepare it for similar concepts on other platforms like Commit Status API from GitLab.\nContributions for implementations on these platforms will be welcomed in the future.\n\nGitHub Checks API Implementation\n\nOur work on supporting GitHub Checks API is mostly done by now.\nBesides, we implemented a consumer to automatically create a check run that simply indicates the current stage of a Jenkins build.\nAfter the release, Jenkins developers (especially publisher plugin ones) can create their own GitHub checks for a GitHub branch source project by consuming our API.\n\nExample: To create a check run like:\n\nConsumers need to use our API in this way:\n\nChecksDetails details = new ChecksDetailsBuilder()\n        .withName(\"Jenkins\")\n        .withStatus(ChecksStatus.COMPLETED)\n        .withDetailsURL(\"https://ci.jenkins.io\")\n        .withStartedAt(LocalDateTime.now(ZoneOffset.UTC))\n        .withCompletedAt(LocalDateTime.now(ZoneOffset.UTC))\n        .withConclusion(ChecksConclusion.SUCCESS)\n        .withOutput(new ChecksOutputBuilder()\n                .withTitle(\"Jenkins Check\")\n                .withSummary(\"# A Successful Build\")\n                .withText(\"## 0 Failures\")\n                .withAnnotations(Arrays.asList(\n                        new ChecksAnnotationBuilder()\n                                .withPath(\"Jenkinsfile\")\n                                .withLine(1)\n                                .withAnnotationLevel(ChecksAnnotationLevel.NOTICE)\n                                .withMessage(\"say hello to Jenkins\")\n                                .withStartColumn(0)\n                                .withEndColumn(20)\n                                .withTitle(\"Hello Jenkins\")\n                                .withRawDetails(\"a simple echo command\")\n                                .build(),\n                        new ChecksAnnotationBuilder()\n                                .withPath(\"Jenkinsfile\")\n                                .withLine(2)\n                                .withAnnotationLevel(ChecksAnnotationLevel.WARNING)\n                                .withMessage(\"say hello to GitHub Checks API\")\n                                .withStartColumn(0)\n                                .withEndColumn(30)\n                                .withTitle(\"Hello GitHub Checks API\")\n                                .withRawDetails(\"a simple echo command\")\n                                .build()))\n                .build())\n        .withActions(Collections.singletonList(\n                new ChecksAction(\"formatting\", \"format code\", \"#0\")))\n        .build();\n\nChecksPublisher publisher = ChecksPublisherFactory.fromRun(run);\npublisher.publish(details);\n\nFuture Works\n\nThe next step is integrating our API into Warnings Next Generation Plugin and Code Coverage API Plugin consume our API.\nAfter that, pipeline support will be added: users can publish checks directly in a pipeline script without requiring a consumer plugin that support the checks.\n\nResources\n\nGitHub Repository\n\nProject Page\n\nGitter Channel\n\nReferences\n\nGitHub Doc: Creating CI tests with the Checks API\n\nWarnings Next Generation Plugin: Source Code View","title":"GitHub Checks API Plugin Project -

It was introduced in a GSoC 2019 project to Jenkins.\n\nJMH is provided within the plugin through the Jenkins Unit Test Harness POM dependency.\n\nThe JMH benchmarks are created and run within the git client plugin\n\nDuring phase-1, we have created benchmarks for two operations: \"git fetch\" and \"git ls-remote\"\n\nResults and Analysis\n\nThe benchmark analysis for git fetch:\n\nGit fetch results\n\nThe performance of git fetch (average execution time/op) is strongly correlated to the size of a repository\n\nThere exists an inflection point on the scale of repository size after which the nature of JGit performance changes (it starts to degrade)\n\nAfter running multiple benchmarks, it is safe to say that for a large sized repository CLI-git would be a better choice of implementation.\n\nWe can use this insight to implement a feature which avoids JGit when it comes to large repositories.\n\nPlease refer to PR-521 for an elaborate explanation on these results\n\nNote: Repository size means du -h .git\n\nFixing redundant fetch issue\n\nThe git plugin performs two fetch operations instead of one while performing a fresh checkout of a remote git repository.\n\nTo fix this issue, we had to safely remove the second fetch keeping multiple use-cases in mind. The fix itself was not difficult to code, but to do that safely without breaking any existing use-case was a challenging task.\n\nFurther Plan\n\nAfter consolidating a benchmarking strategy during Phase 1, the next steps will be:\n\nProvide functionality to the git plugin, which enables it to estimate the size of the repository without cloning it.\n\nBroaden the scope of benchmarking strategy\n\nConsider parameters like number of branches, references and commit history to find a relation with the performance of a git operation\n\nThe git plugin depends on other plugins like Credentials which might require benchmarking the plugin itself and the effects of these external dependencies on the plugin’s performance\n\nFocus on other use-cases of the plugin\n\nFor phase-1, I focused on the checkout step and the operations involved with it\n\nFor the next phase, the focus will shift to other areas like Multibranch pipelines or Organisation Folders\n\nHow can you help?\n\nIf you have reached this far of the blog, you might be interested in the project.\n\nTo help, you can\n\nReview the benchmarks in the benchmarks module\n\nAnalyse the benchmarks results available on ci.jenkins.io [soon]\n\nCome visit our Gitter channel: https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/git-plugin","title":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement: Phase-1","tags":["plugins","git","platform-sig","developer","performance","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#685848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/77b35/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/d4a57/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/68974/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/ef6ff/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/8257c/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/6766a/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/22bfc/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"rishabhBudhouliya","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2020 student under the Jenkins project (Git Plugin Performance Improvements).\nAspiring to be better at Software Development and participate more in the open source\ncommunity.</p>\n</div>","id":"rishabhbudhouliya","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rishabh Budhouliya","slug":"/blog/authors/rishabhbudhouliya","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a288c37b-abcd-5bdc-8b5b-012344f2934c","slug":"/blog/2020/06/27/external-fingerprint-storage/","strippedHtml":"Externalizing fingerprint storage for Jenkins is a  Google Summer of Code 2020 project.\nWe are working on building a pluggable storage engine for fingerprints (see jep:226[]).\n\nFile fingerprinting is a way to track which version of a file is being used by a job/build, making dependency tracking easy.

The unique ID for a fingerprint is defined by Fingerprint#getHashString().\n\nvoid delete(String id)\n\nDeletes the Fingerprint with the given unique ID.\n\nboolean isReady()\n\nReturns true if there is some data in the fingerprint database corresponding to the particular Jenkins instance.\n\nIntroducing Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin uses the new External Fingerprint Storage API to store the fingerprints in a Redis instance.\n\nInstallation:\n\nThe alpha release (version 0.1-alpha-1) for the plugin was drafted, and can be installed using the experimental update center.\n\nFollow along the following steps after running Jenkins to download and install the plugin:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Manage Plugins\n\nGo to Advanced tab\n\nConfigure the Update Site URL as: https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/update-center.json\n\nClick on Submit, and then press the Check Now button.\n\nGo to Available tab.\n\nSearch for Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin and check the box along it.\n\nClick on Install without restart\n\nThe plugin should now be installed on your system.\n\nUsage\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, you can configure the Redis server details by following the steps below:\n\nSelect Manage Jenkins\n\nSelect Configure System\n\nScroll to the section Redis Fingerprint Storage Configuration and fill in the required details:\n\nHost - Enter hostname where Redis is running\n\nPort - Specify the port on which Redis is running\n\nSSL - Click if SSL is enabled\n\nDatabase - Redis supports integer indexed databases, which can be specified here.\n\nConnection Timeout - Set the connection timeout duration in milliseconds.\n\nSocked Timeout - Set the socket timeout duration in milliseconds.\n\nCredentials - Configure authentication using username and password to the Redis instance.\n\nEnabled - Check this to enable the plugin (Note: This is likely to be removed very soon, and will be enabled by default.)\n\nUse the Test Redis Connection to verify that the details are correct and Jenkins is able to connect to the Redis instance.\n\nPress the Save button.\n\nNow, all the fingerprints produced by this Jenkins instance should be saved in the configured Redis server!\n\nFuture Work\n\nSome of the topics we aim to tackle in the next phases include extending the API, fingerprint cleanup, migrations (internal→external, external→internal, external→external), tracing, ORM, implementing the saveable listener, etc.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe Redis Fingerprint Storage plugin is built and maintained by the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Team for\nExternal Fingerprint Storage for Jenkins.\n\nSpecial thanks to Oleg Nenashev, Andrey Falko, Mike Cirioli, Jesse Glick, and the entire Jenkins community for all the contribution to this project.\n\nReaching Out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions, feedback, etc. on the project’s Gitter Channel or the Jenkins Developer Mailing list\n\nWe use Jenkins Jira to track issues.\nFeel free to file issues under redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin component.\n\nOther Links\n\nPhase 1 demo\n\nPresentation slides\n\nRedis Fingerprint Storage Plugin\n\nIssue Tracker for Phase 1\n\njep:226[]\n\nGitter Channel\n\nProject Page","title":"External Fingerprint Storage Phase-1 Updates","tags":["plugins","fingerprint","cloud-native","external-storage","developer","redis","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/19e71/stellargo.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/77b35/stellargo.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/d4a57/stellargo.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/19e71/stellargo.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/ef6ff/stellargo.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/8257c/stellargo.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/57deb704d1eb39e35b9de4a8c22ea56e/6766a/stellargo.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://medium.com/@sumitsarinofficial","github":"stellargo","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2020 student.

There\nare plugins available to render the test results, the code coverage, the static analysis and so on. All of these plugins\ntypically pick up the build results of a given build step and show them in the user interface. In order to render these\ndetails most of the plugins use static HTML pages, since this type of user interface is the standard visualization in\nJenkins since its inception in 2007.\n\nIn order to improve the look and feel and the user experience of these plugins it makes sense to move forward and\nincorporate some modern Java Script libraries and components. Since development of Blue Ocean has been stopped (see\nJenkins mailing list post)\nplugin authors need to decide on their own, which UI technologies are helpful for that task. However, the universe of\nmodern UI components is so overwhelming that it makes sense to pick up only a small set of components that are proven\nto be useful and compatible with Jenkins underlying web technologies. Moreover, the initial setup of\nincorporating such a new component is quite large so it would be helpful if that work needs to be done only once.\n\nThis guide introduces a few UI components\nthat make sense to be used by all plugin authors in the future to provide a rich user interface for reports in Jenkins.\nIn order to simplify the usage of these libraries in the context of Jenkins as a Java based web application, these\nJava Script libraries and components have been packaged as ordinary Jenkins plugins.\n\nIn the following sections, these new components will be introduced step by step. In order to see how these components\ncan be used a plugin, I demonstrate the new features while enhancing the existing\nForensics Plugin with a new user\ninterface. Since the Warnings Next Generation Plugin also uses these new components, you can see additional examples\nin the documentation of the warnings plugin\nor in our public ci.jenkins.io instance, that\nalready is using these components in the detail views of the warnings plugin.\n\n1. New user interface plugins\n\nThe following UI components are provided as new Jenkins plugins:\n\njquery3-api-plugin :\nProvides jQuery 3 for Jenkins Plugins.\njQuery is — as described on their home page — a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things\nlike HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API\nthat works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the\nway that millions of people write JavaScript.\n\nbootstrap4-api-plugin :\nProvides Bootstrap 4 for Jenkins Plugins. Bootstrap is — according to their self-perception — the world’s most popular front-end component library to build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. It is\nan open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Developers can quickly prototype their ideas or\nbuild entire apps with their Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins\nbuilt on jQuery.\n\ndata-tables-api-plugin :\nProvides DataTables for Jenkins Plugins.\nDataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library. It is a highly flexible tool, built upon the foundations\nof progressive enhancement, that adds all of these advanced features to any HTML table:\n\nPrevious, next and page navigation\n\nFilter results by text search\n\nSort data by multiple columns at once\n\nDOM, Javascript, Ajax and server-side processing\n\nEasily theme-able\n\nMobile friendly\n\necharts-api-plugin :\nProvides ECharts for Jenkins Plugins. ECharts is an open-sourced\nJavaScript visualization tool to create intuitive, interactive, and highly-customizable charts. It\ncan run fluently on PC and mobile devices and it is compatible with most modern\nWeb Browsers.\n\nfont-awesome-api-plugin :\nProvides Font Awesome for Jenkins Plugins. Font Awesome has vector icons and social logos,\naccording to their self-perception it is the web’s most popular icon set and toolkit. Currently, it contains more than\n1,500 free icons.\n\npopper-api-plugin\nProvides Popper.js for Jenkins Plugins. Popper can\neasily position tooltips, popovers or anything else with just a line of code.\n\nplugin-util-api-plugin : This small plugin provides\nsome helper and base classes to simplify the creation of reporters in Jenkins. This plugin also\nprovides a set of architecture rules that can be included in an architecture test suite of your plugin.\n\n2. Required changes for a plugin POM\n\nIn order to use these plugins you need to add them as dependencies in your plugin pom. You can use the following snippet\nto add them all:\n\npom.xml\n\n[...]\n\n1.0.2\n5.12.0-7\n4.4.1-10\n4.6.0-8\n1.10.20-13\n[...]\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\nplugin-util-api\n${plugin-util-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\nfont-awesome-api\n${font-awesome-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\nbootstrap4-api\n${bootstrap4-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\necharts-api\n${echarts-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\ndata-tables-api\n${data-tables-api.version}\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\nAlternatively, you have a look at the POM files of the\nWarnings Next Generation Plugin or the\nForensics API Plugin which already use these\nplugins.\n\n3. General structure of a reporter\n\nIn this section I will explain some fundamentals of the design of Jenkins, i.e. the Java model and the associated\nuser interface elements. If you are already familiar on how to implement the corresponding extension points of a\nreporter plugin (see section Extensibility in Jenkins'\ndeveloper guide), then you can skip this section and head directly to Section 3.1.\n\nJenkins organizes projects using the static object model structure shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Jenkins design - high level view of the Java model\n\nThe top level items in Jenkins user interface are jobs (at least the top level items\nwe are interested in). Jenkins contains several jobs of different types (Freestyle jobs, Maven Jobs, Pipelines, etc.).\n\nEach of these jobs contains an arbitrary number of builds (or more technically, runs). Each build is identified by its\nunique build number. Jenkins plugins can attach results to these builds, e.g. build artifacts, test results,\nanalysis reports, etc. In order to attach such a result, a plugin technically needs to implement and create an action\nthat stores these results.\n\nThese Java objects are visualized in several different views, which are described in more detail in the following\nsections. The top-level view that shows all available Jobs is shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Jenkins view showing all available jobs\n\nPlugins can also contribute UI elements in these views, but this is out of scope of this guide.\n\nEach job has a detail view, where plugins can extend corresponding extension points and provide summary boxes and\ntrend charts. Typically, summary boxes for reporters are not required on the job level, so I describe only trend charts\nin more detail, see section Section 5.5.2.\n\nFigure 3. Jenkins view showing details about a job\n\nEach build has a detail view as well. Here plugins can provide summary boxes similar to the boxes for the job details\nview. Typically, plugins show here only a short summary and provide a link to detailed results, see Figure 4 for\nan example.\n\nFigure 4. Jenkins view showing details about a build\n\nThe last element in the view hierarchy actually is a dedicated view that shows the results of a specific plugin. E.g.,\nthere are views to show the test results, the analysis results, and so on. It is totally up to a given plugin what\nelements should be shown there. In the next few sections I will introduce some new UI components that can be used\nto show the corresponding results in a pleasant way.\n\n3.1. Extending Jenkins object model\n\nSince reporters typically are composed in a similar way, I extended Jenkins' original object model\n(see Figure 1) with some additional elements, so it will be much simpler to create or implement\na new reporter plugin. This new model is shown in Figure 5. The central element is a build action that\nwill store the results of a plugin reporter. This action will be attached to each build and will hold (and persist) the\nresults for a reporter. The detail data of each action will be automatically stored in an additional file, so the\nmemory footprint of Jenkins can be kept small if the details are never requested by users. Additionally, this\naction is also used to simplify the creation of project actions and trend charts, see Section 5.5.2.\n\nFigure 5. Jenkins reporter design - high level view of the model for reporter plugins\n\n4. Git Forensics plugin\n\nThe elements in this tutorial will be all used in the new\nForensics API Plugin (actually the plugin is not new, it is a dependency of the\nWarnings Next Generation Plugin). You can download the plugin content\nand see in more detail how these new components can be used in practice. Or you can change this plugin just to see\nhow these new components can be parametrized.\n\nIf you are using Git as source code management system then this plugin will mine\nthe repository in the style of\nCode as a Crime Scene\n(Adam Tornhill, November 2013) to determine statistics of the contained source code files:\n\ntotal number of commits\n\ntotal number of different authors\n\ncreation time\n\nlast modification time\n\nThe plugin provides a new step (or post build publisher) that starts the repository mining and stores\nthe collected information in a Jenkins action (see Figure 5). Afterwards you get a new\nbuild summary that shows the total number of scanned files (as trend and as build result). From\nhere you can navigate to the details view that shows the scanned files in a table that can be\nsimply sorted and filtered. You also will get some pie charts that show important aspects of the\ncommit history.\n\nPlease note that this functionality of the plugin still is a proof of concept: the performance of this step heavily\ndepends on the size and the number of commits of your Git repository. Currently it scans the whole repository in each\nbuild. In the near future I hope to find a volunteer who is interested in replacing this dumb algorithm with an incremental scanner.\n\n5. Introducing the new  UI components\n\nAs already mentioned in Section 3, a details view is plugin specific. What is shown and how these\nelements are presented is up to the individual plugin author. So in the next sections I provide some examples\nand new concepts that plugins can use as building blocks for their own content.\n\n5.1. Modern icons\n\nJenkins plugins typically do not use icons very frequently. Most plugins provide an icon for the actions and that’s it.\nIf you intend to use icons in other places, plugin authors are left on their own: the recommended Tango icon set is more\nthan 10 years old and too limited nowadays. There are several options available, but the most popular is the\nFont Awesome Icon Set. It provides more than 1500 free icons that follow the same\ndesign guidelines:\n\nFigure 6. Font Awesome icons in Jenkins plugins\n\nIn order to use Font Awesome icons in a plugin you simply need a dependency to the corresponding\nfont-awesome-api-plugin. Then you can use any of the solid icons\nby using the new tag svg-icon in your jelly view:\n\nindex.jelly\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\nIf you are generating views using Java code, then you also can use the class SvgTag to generate the\nHTML markup for such an icon.\n\n5.2. Grid layout\n\nJenkins currently includes in all views an old and patched version of Boostrap’s grid system (with 24 columns). This version\nis not compatible with Boostrap 4 or any of the JS libraries that depend on Bootstrap4. In order to use Bootstrap 4\nfeatures we need to replace the Jenkins provided layout.jelly file with a patched version, that does not load\nthe broken grid system. I’m planning to create a PR that fixes the grid in Jenkins core, but that will take some time.\nUntil then you will need to use the provided layout.jelly of the Boostrap4 plugin, see below.\n\nThe first thing to decide is, which elements should be shown on a plugin page and how much space each element\nshould occupy. Typically, all visible components are mapped on the available space using a simple grid.\nIn a Jenkins view we have a fixed header and footer and a navigation bar on the left\n(20 percent of the horizontal space). The rest of a screen can be used by\na details view. In order to simplify the distribution of elements in that remaining space we use\nBootstrap’s grid system.\n\nFigure 7. Jenkins layout with a details view that contains a grid system\n\nThat means, a view is split into 12 columns and and arbitrary number of rows. This grid system is simple to use\n(but complex enough to also support fancy screen layouts) - I won’t go into\ndetails here, please refer to the Bootstrap documentation\nfor details.\n\nFor the forensics detail view we use a simple grid of two rows and two columns. Since the number of columns always is 12\nwe need to create two \"fat\" columns that fill 6 of the standard columns.\nIn order to create such a view in our\nplugin we need to create a view given as a jelly file and a corresponding Java view model object. A view with this layout\nis shown in the following snippet:\n\nindex.jelly\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n(4)\n(5)\nContent of column 1 in row 1\n\n(6)\nContent of column 2 in row 1\n\n(7)\n(8)\nContent of row 2\n\n1\nUse a custom layout based on Bootstrap: since Jenkins core contains an old version of Bootstrap,\nwe need to replace the standard layout.jelly file.\n\n2\nImport Bootstrap 4: Importing of JS and CSS components is done using the adjunct concept,\nwhich is the preferred way of referencing static resources within Jenkins' Stapler Web framework.\n\n3\nThe whole view will be placed into a fluid container that fills up the whole screen (100% width).\n\n4\nA new row of the view is specified with class row. The additional class py-3 defines the padding to use for\nthis row, see Bootstrap Spacing for more details.\n\n5\nSince Bootstrap automatically splits up a row into 12 equal sized columns we define here\nthat the first column should occupy 6 of these 12 columns. You can also leave off the detailed numbers, then Bootstrap will\nautomatically distribute the content in the available space. Just be aware that this not what you want in most of the times.\n\n6\nThe second column uses the remaining space, i.e. 6 of the 12 columns.\n\n7\nThe second row uses the same layout as row 1.\n\n8\nThere is only one column for row 1, it will fill the whole available space.\n\nYou can also specify different column layouts for one row, based on the actual visible size of the screen.\nThis helps to improve the layout for larger screens. In the warnings plugin you will find\nan example: on small devices, there is one card visible that shows one pie chart in a carousel. If you are\nopening the same page on a larger device, then two of the pie charts are shown side by side and the carousel is hidden.\n\n5.3. Cards\n\nWhen presenting information of a plugin as a block, typically plain text elements are shown. This will normally result\nin some kind of boring web pages. In order to create a more appealing interface, it makes sense to present such information\nin a card, that has a border, a header, an icon, and so on. In order to create such a\nBootstrap card a small jelly tag has been provided by the new\nBootstrap plugin that simplifies this task for a plugin.\nSuch a card can be easily created in a jelly view in the following way:\n\nContent of the card\n\nIn Figure 8 examples of such cards are shown. The cards in the upper row contain pie charts that show the\ndistribution of the number of authors and commits in the whole repository. The card at the bottom shows the detail\ninformation in a DataTable. The visualization is not limited to charts or tables, you can\nshow any kind of HTML content in there. You can show any icon of your\nplugin in these cards, but it is recommended to use one of the existing Font Awesome icons\nto get a consistent look and feel in Jenkins' plugin ecosystem.\n\nFigure 8. Bootstraps cards in Jenkins plugins\n\nNote that the size of the cards is determined by the grid configuration, see Section 5.2.\n\n5.4. Tables\n\nA common UI element to show plugin details is a table control. Most plugins (and Jenkins core) typically use\nplain HTML tables. However, if the table should show a large number of rows then using a more sophisticated control\nlike DataTables makes more sense. Using this JS based table control provides additional\nfeatures at no cost:\n\nfilter results by text search\n\nprovide pagination of the result set\n\nsort data by multiple columns at once\n\nobtain table rows using Ajax calls\n\nshow and hide columns based on the screen resolution\n\nIn order to use DataTables in a view there are two options, you can either decorate existing\nstatic HTML tables (see Section 5.4.1) or populate the table content using Ajax (see Section 5.4.2).\n\n5.4.1. Tables with static HTML content\n\nThe easiest way of using DataTables is by creating a static HTML table that will be decorated by simply calling the\nconstructor of the datatable. This approach involves no special handling on the Java and Jelly side, so I think it is\nsufficient to follow the example in the DataTables\ndocumentation. Just make sure that after building the table in your Jelly file you need to decorate the table\nwith the following piece of code:\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\n1\nreplace id with the ID of your HTML table element\n\nIn the Forensics plugin no such static table is used so far, but you can have a look at the\ntable that shows fixed warnings\nin the warnings plugin to see how such a table can be decorated.\n\n5.4.2. Tables with dynamic model based content\n\nWhile static HTML tables are easy to implement, they have several limitations. So it makes sense to follow a more\nsophisticated approach. Typically, tables in user interfaces are defined by using a corresponding table (and row) model.\nJava Swing successfully provides such a\ntable model concept since the early days of Java.\nI adapted these concepts for Jenkins and DataTables as well. In order to create a table in a Jenkins view a plugin\nneeds to provide a table model class, that provides the following information:\n\nthe ID of the table (since there might be several tables in the view)\n\nthe model of the columns (i.e., the number, type, and header labels of the columns)\n\nthe content of the table (i.e. the individual row objects)\n\nYou will find an example of such a table in the Forensics plugin: here a table lists\nthe files in your Git repository combined with the corresponding commit statistics (number of authors,\nnumber of commits, last modification, first commit). A screenshot of that table is shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9. Dynamic Table in the Forensics plugin\n\nIn order to create such a table in Jenkins, you need to create a table model class that derives from TableModel.\nIn Figure 10 a diagram of the corresponding classes in the Forensics plugin is shown.\n\nFigure 10. Table model of the Forensics plugin\n\nTable column model\n\nThis first thing a table model class defines is a model of the available columns by creating corresponding\nTableColumn instances. For each column you need to specify a header label and the name of the bean property that\nshould be shown in the corresponding column (the row elements are actually Java beans: each column will\nshow one distinct property of such a bean, see next section). You can\nuse any of the supported column types by simply providing a\nString or Integer based column.\n\nTable rows content\n\nAdditionally, a table model class provides the content of the rows. This getRows() method\nwill be invoked asynchronously using an Ajax call. Typically, this method simply returns a list of Java Bean instances,\nthat provide the properties of each column (see previous section). These objects will be converted automatically\nto an array of JSON objects, the basic data structure required for the DataTables API.\nYou will find a fully working example table model\nimplementation in the Git repository of the forensics plugin in the class\nForensicsTableModel.\n\nIn order to use such a table in your plugin view you need to create the table in the associated\nJelly file using the new table tag:\n\nindex.jelly\n\n[...]\n\n(1)\n[...]\n\n1\nreplace id with the id of your table\n\nThe only parameter you need to provide for the table is the model — it is typically part of the corresponding\nJenkins view model class (this object is referenced with ${it} in the view).\nIn order to connect the corresponding Jenkins view model class with the table, the view model class needs to\nimplement the AsyncTableContentProvider interface. Or even simpler, let your view model class derive from\nDefaultAsyncTableContentProvider. This relationship is required, so that Jenkins can automatically create\nand bind a proxy for the Ajax calls that will automatically fill the table content after the HTML page has been created.\n\nIf we put all those pieces together, we are required to define a model similar to the model of the Forensics plugin,\nthat is shown in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11. Jenkins reporter design - high level view of the model for reporter plugins\n\nAs already described in Figure 5 the plugin needs to attach a BuildAction to each build. The\nForensics plugin attaches a ForensicBuildAction to the build. This action stores a RepositoryStatistics instance,\nthat contains the repository results for a given build. This action delegates all Stapler requests to a new\nstaplerdoc:org.kohsuke.stapler.StaplerProxy[Stapler proxy instance] so we can keep the\naction clean of user interface code. This ForensicsViewModel class then acts as view model that provides the server\nside model for the corresponding Jelly view given by the file index.jelly.\n\nWhile this approach looks quite complex at a first view, you will see that the actual implementation part\nis quite small. Most of the boilerplate code is already provided by the base classes and you need to implement\nonly a few methods. Using this concept also provides some additional features, that are part of the DataTables plugin:\n\nOrdering of columns is persisted automatically in the browser local storage.\n\nPaging size is persisted automatically in the browser local storage.\n\nThe Ajax calls are actually invoked only if a table will become visible. So if you have\nseveral tables hidden in tabs then the content will be loaded on demand only, reducing the amount of data\nto be transferred.\n\nThere is an option available to provide an additional details row that can be expanded with a + symbol,\nsee warnings plugin table for details.\n\n5.5. Charts\n\nA plugin reporter typically also reports some kind of trend from build to build. Up to now Jenkins core provides only a\nquite limited concept of rendering such trends as trend charts. The\nJFreeChart framework offered by Jenkins core is a server\nside rendering engine that creates charts as static PNG images that will be included on the job and details pages.\nNowadays, several powerful JS based charting libraries are available, that do the same job\n(well actually an even better job) on the client side. That has the advantage that these charts can be customized\non each client without affecting the server performance. Moreover, you get a lot of additional\nfeatures (like zooming, animation, etc.) for free. Additionally, these charting libraries not only support the typical\nbuild trend charts but also a lot of additional charts types that can be used to improve the user experience of\na plugin.\nOne of those charting libraries is ECharts : this library has a powerful API\nand supports literally every chart type one can image of. You can get some impressions of the features on the\nexamples page of the library.\n\nIn order to use these charts one can embed charts that use this library by importing the corresponding JS files and by\ndefining the chart in the corresponding Jelly file. While that already works quite well it\nwill be still somewhat cumbersome to provide the corresponding model for these charts from Jenkins build results. So\nI added a powerful Java API that helps to create the model for these charts on the Java side. This API provides the\nfollowing features:\n\nCreate trend charts based on a collection of build results.\n\nSeparate the chart type from the aggregation in order to simplify unit testing of the chart model.\n\nToggle the type of the X-Axis between build number or build date (with automatic aggregation of results that\nhave been recorded at the same day).\n\nAutomatic conversion of the Java model to the required JSON model for the JS side.\n\nSupport for pie and line charts (more to come soon).\n\nThose charts can be used as trend chart in the project page (see Figure 3) or as information chart in the details\nview of a plugin (see Section 5).\n\n5.5.1. Pie charts\n\nA simple but still informative chart is a pie chart that illustrates numerical proportions of plugin data. In the Forensics\nplugin I am using this chart to show the numerical proportions of the number of authors or commits for the\nsource code files in the Git repository (see Figure 8). In the warnings plugin I use this chart to show the\nnumerical proportions of the new, outstanding, or fixed warnings, see Figure 12.\n\nFigure 12. Pie chart in the Warnings plugin\n\nIn order to include such a chart in your details view, you can use the provided pie-chart tag.\nIn the following snippet you see this tag in action (embedded in a Bootstrap card, see Section 5.3):\n\nindex.jelly\n\n[...]\n<c:pie-chart id=\"authors\" model=\"${it.authorsModel}\" height=\"256\" />\n\n[...]\n\nYou need to provide a unique ID for this chart and the corresponding model value. The model must be the JSON\nrepresentation of a corresponding PieChartModel instance. Such a model can be created with a couple of lines:\n\nViewModel.java\n\n[...]\n    PieChartModel model = new PieChartModel(\"Title\");\n\n    model.add(new PieData(\"Segment 1 name\", 10), Palette.RED);\n    model.add(new PieData(\"Segment 2 name\", 15), Palette.GREEN);\n    model.add(new PieData(\"Segment 3 name\", 20), Palette.YELLOW);\n\n    String json = new JacksonFacade().toJson(model);\n    [...]\n\n5.5.2. Trend charts on the job level view\n\nIn order to show a trend that renders a line chart on the job page (see Figure 3) you need to provide a so called\nfloating box (stored in the file floatingBox.jelly of your job action (see Section 3)).\nThe content of this file is quite simple and contains just a trend-chart tag:\n\nfloatingBox.jelly\n\n<c:trend-chart it=\"${from}\" title=\"${%SCM Files Count Trend}\" enableLinks=\"true\"/>\n\nOn the Java side the model for the chart needs to be provided in the corresponding sub class of JobAction (which is\nthe owner of the floating box). Since the computation of trend charts is quite expensive on the server side as well\n(several builds need to be read from disk and the interesting data points need to be computed) this process has been\nput into a separate background job. Once the computation is done the result is shown via an Ajax call. In order to\nhide these details for plugin authors you should simply derive your JobAction class from the corresponding\nAsyncTrendJobAction class, that already contains the boilerplate code. So your static plugin object model will actually\nbecome a little bit more complex:\n\nFigure 13. Jenkins chart model design\n\nBasically, you need to implement the method LinesChartModel createChartModel() to create the line\nchart. This method is quite simple to implement, since most of the hard work is provided by the library: you will\ninvoke with an iterator of your build actions, starting with the latest build. The iterator advances from build to build\nuntil no more results are available (or the maximum number of builds to consider has been reached). The most important\nthing to implement in your plugin is the way how data points are computed for a given BuildAction. Here is an example of\nsuch a SeriesBuilder implementation in the Forensics Plugin:\n\nFilesCountSeriesBuilder.java\n\npackage io.jenkins.plugins.forensics.miner;\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\nimport edu.hm.hafner.echarts.SeriesBuilder;\n\n/**\n * Builds one x-axis point for the series of a line chart showing the number of files in the repository.\n *\n * @author Ullrich Hafner\n */\npublic class FilesCountSeriesBuilder extends SeriesBuilder {\n    static final String TOTALS_KEY = \"total\";\n\n    @Override\n    protected Map computeSeries(final ForensicsBuildAction current) {\n        Map series = new HashMap<>();\n        series.put(TOTALS_KEY, current.getNumberOfFiles());\n        return series;\n    }\n}\n\nYou are not limited to a single line chart. You can show several lines in a single chart, you can show stacked values,\nor even the delta between some values. You can also have a look at the\ncharts of the warnings plugin\nto see some of these features in detail.\n\nFigure 14. Trend chart with several lines in the Warnings plugin\n\nFigure 15.

It is integrated into the build process to improve the code before it gets merged and released. Findsecbugs is a plugin for Spotbugs that adds 135 vulnerability types focused on the OWASP TOP 10 and the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). I’m working on integrating findsecbugs into our Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nBackground\n\nSpotbugs traces its history through Findbugs, which started in 2006. As Findbugs it was widely adopted by many projects. About 2016, the Findbugs project ground to a halt. Like the mythical phoenix, the Spotbugs project rose from the ashes to keep the capabilities alive. Most things are completely compatible between the two systems.\n\nJenkins has used Findbugs and now Spotbugs for years. This is integrated as a build step into parent Maven poms, including the plugin parent pom and the parent pom for libraries and core components. There are various properties that can be set to control the detection threshold, the effort, and findings or categories to exclude. Take a look at the effective pom for a project to see the settings.\n\nConundrums\n\nThere is a fundamental conundrum with introducing an analysis tool into a project. The best time to have done it is always in the past, particularly when the project first started. There are always difficulties in introducing it into an existing project. Putting it off for later just delays the useful results and makes later implementation more difficult. The best time to do it is now, as early as possible.\n\nAll analysis tools are imperfect. They report some issues that don’t actually exist. They miss some important issues. This is worse in legacy code, making the adoption more difficult. Findings have to be examined and evaluated. Some are code weaknesses but don’t indicate necessary fixes. For example, MD5 has been known for years as a weak algorithm, unsuitable for security uses. It can be used for non-security purposes, such as fingerprinting, but even there other algorithms (SHA-2) are preferred. We should replace all usages of MD5, but in some cases that’s difficult and it’s not exactly a problem.\n\nUltimately, the gain from these analysis tools isn’t so much from finding issues in existing code. The value comes more from catching new regressions that might be introduced or improving new code. This is one reason why it is valuable to add useful new analysis such as findsecbugs now, so that we can begin reaping the benefits.\n\nWith a security tool like findsecbugs, there is another paradox. Adding the tool makes it easier to find potential security issues. Attackers could take advantage of this information. However, security by obscurity is not a good design. Anyone can run findsecbugs now without the project integrating it. Integrating it makes it easier for legitimate developers to resolve issues and prevent future ones.\n\nImplementation\n\nI’ve been working on integrating findsecbugs into the Jenkins project for several months. It is working in several repos. There are several others where I have presented draft PRs to demonstrate what it will look like once it is enabled. As soon as we can disseminate the information enough, I propose to enable it in the parent poms for widespread use.\n\nExisting\n\nI started by enabling findsecbugs in two major components where I have a high degree of familiarity, Remoting, and Jenkins. Most of the work here involves examining each finding and figuring out what to do with it. In most cases this results in using one of the suppression mechanisms to ignore the finding. In some cases, the code can be removed or improved.\n\nFindsecbugs reported a significant number of false positives in Remoting for a couple of notable reasons. (See the PR.) Remoting uses Spotbugs aggressively with a Low threshold setting. This produces more results. Findsecbugs targets Java web applications. As the communication layer between agents and controller, Remoting uses some mechanisms that would be a problem on the server side but are acceptable on the agent.\n\nEven without all its plugins, Jenkins is a considerable collection of code. Findsecbugs reported a smaller number of false positives for Jenkins (See the PR.) It runs Spotbugs at a High threshold, so it only reports issues it deems more concerning. A number of these indicate code debt, deprecated code to remove, or areas that could be improved. I created Jira tickets for many of these.\n\nDemonstrated\n\nI have created draft PRs to demonstrate how findsecbugs will look in several plugins. The goal is not to use these PRs directly but instead integrate findsecbugs at the parent pom level. These PRs serve as reference documentation.\n\nCredentials\n\nThis one is particularly interesting because here findsecbugs correctly detects the remains of a valid security vulnerability ( CVE-2019-10320). Currently, this code is safely used only for migration of old data. If we had run findsecbugs on this plugin a year ago, it would have detected this valid vulnerability.\n\nSSH Build Agents\n\nThis one is interesting because it flags MD5 as a concern. Since it is used for fingerprinting, it isn’t a valid vulnerability, but since the hash isn’t stored it is easy to improve the code here.\n\nEC2\n\nIn this case, findsecbugs found some valid concerns, but the code isn’t used so it can be removed. Also, MD5 is harder to remove here but should be considered technical debt and removed when possible.\n\nPlatform Labeler\n\nFindsecbugs didn’t find any concerns here. This means adapting to it requires no work. In this demonstration, I added a fake finding to prove that it was working.\n\nFile Leak Detector\n\nThere is one simple finding noted here. Because it is part of the configuration performed by an administrator we can ignore it.\n\nCredentials Binding\n\nNothing was found here so integration requires no effort.\n\nProposed\n\nMy proposal is to integrate findsecbugs configuration into the parent poms as soon as we can. The delay is currently mostly around sharing the information to prepare developers by blog post, email list discussion, and presentation.\n\nEven before I started working on this, StefanSpieker proposed a PR to integrate into the parent Jenkins pom. This will apply to Jenkins libraries and core components. Once this is integrated, I will pull out the changes I made to the Jenkins and Remoting project poms.\n\nI also plan on integrating findsecbugs into the plugin and Stapler parent poms. Once it is added to the plugin parent pom all plugins will automatically perform these checks when they upgrade their parent pom version. If there are any findings, developers will need to take care of them as described in the next section.\n\nWhat do you need to do?\n\nOnce developers upgrade to a parent pom version that integrates findsecbugs, they may have to deal with evaluating, fixing, or suppressing findings. The parent pom versions do not yet exist but are in process or proposed.\n\nExtraneous build message\n\nIn some cases, an extraneous message may show up in the build logs. It starts with a line like this The following classes needed for analysis were missing: followed by lines listing some methods by name. Ignore this message. It results from SpotBugs printing some internal, debug information that isn’t helpful here.\n\nExamine findings\n\nIf findsecbugs reports any findings, then a developer needs to examine and determine what to do about each one.\n\nExcluding issues\n\nYou can exclude an issue, so that it is never reported in a project. This is done by configuring an exclusion file. If you encounter the findings CRLF_INJECTION_LOGS or INFORMATION_EXPOSURE_THROUGH_AN_ERROR_MESSAGE feel free to add these to an exclusion file. These are not considered a concern in Jenkins. See the Jenkins project exclusion file for an example. You should be cautious about including other issue types here.\n\nTemporarily disable findsecbugs\n\nYou may disable findsecbugs by adding to the exclusion file. I strongly encourage you to only disable findsecbugs temporarily when genuinely needed.\n\nSuppress a finding\n\nAfter determining that a finding is not important, you can suppress it by annotating a method or a class with @SuppressFBWarnings(value = “…​”, justification=”…​”). I encourage you to suppress narrowly. Never suppress at the class level when you can add it to a method. For a long method, extract the problematic part into a small method and add the suppression there. I also encourage you to always add a meaningful justification.\n\nImprove code\n\nWhenever possible improve the code such that the problematic code no longer exists. This can include removing deprecated or unused code, using improved algorithms, or improving structure or implementation. This is where the significant gains come from with SpotBugs and findsecbugs. Also, as you make changes or add new features make sure to implement them so as not to introduce new issues.\n\nReport security vulnerabilities\n\nIf you encounter a finding related to a valid security vulnerability, please report it via the Jenkins security reporting process. This is the responsible behavior that benefits the community. Try not to discuss or call attention to the issue before it can be disclosed in a Jenkins security advisory.\n\nCreate tasks\n\nIf you discover an improvement area that is too large to fit into your current work or release plan, I encourage you to record a task to get it done. You can do this in Jira, like I did for several issues in Jenkins core, or in whatever task management system you use.\n\nConclusion\n\nSpotBugs has long been used in Jenkins to catch bugs and improve code quality. Findsecbugs adds valuable security-related bug definitions. As we integrate it into the existing Jenkins code base it will require analysis and suppression for legacy code. This identifies areas we can improve and enhances quality as we move forward. Please responsibly report any security vulnerabilites you discover.","title":"Findsecbugs for Developers","tags":["jenkins","security","developer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#685848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/19e71/jeffret-b.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/77b35/jeffret-b.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/d4a57/jeffret-b.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/19e71/jeffret-b.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/68974/jeffret-b.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/ef6ff/jeffret-b.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/8257c/jeffret-b.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/6766a/jeffret-b.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/22bfc/jeffret-b.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"jeffret-b","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jeff has been using Jenkins for many years.\nSince 2018 he has been contributing to Jenkins core and plugins.\nHe maintains the Remoting library and participates on the Jenkins security team.</p>\n</div>","id":"jeffret-b","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Jeff Thompson","slug":"/blog/authors/jeffret-b","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"e3541aaa-92ad-5cb5-8924-7de87ca344b2","slug":"/blog/2019/12/20/call-for-mentors/","strippedHtml":"Google Summer of Code (GSoC)\nis as program where students are paid a stipend by Google to work on a free open source project.\nStudents work on the project full-time for four months (May to August).\nMentors are actively involved with students starting at the end of February when students start to work on and submit their applications.\n(see the timeline)\n\nWe are looking for project ideas and mentors to participate in GSoC 2020.\nGSoC project ideas are coding projects that university or college students can accomplish in about four months.\nThe coding projects can be new features, plugins, test frameworks, infrastructure, etc.\nAnyone can submit a project idea, but of course we like it even better if you offer to mentor your project idea.\n\nWe accept new project ideas at any time,\nBUT we need a series of ideas READY before February 5th, 2020 at 7pm UTC,\nwhich is the deadline for the Jenkins organization to apply to the GSoC program.\nSo send us your project ideas before the beginning of February so they can get a proper review by the GSoC committee and by the community.\n\nHow to submit a project idea\n\nFor 2020, we have simplified the process.\nSimply create a pull-request with your idea in a.adoc file\nin the idea folder.\nIt is no longer necessary to submit a Google Doc, but it will still work if you want to do that.\nSee the instructions on submitting ideas which include an.adoc template and some examples.\n\nCurrent list of ideas\n\nWe currently have a list of project ideas for students to browse,\ncopied from last year.

EPIC for Plugin site and GitHub integrations\n\njenkins-infra/plugin-site - Frontend (JavaScript, React, XSS, YARN)\n\njenkins-infra/plugin-site-api - Plugin site API and Docker packaging (Java, Maven, Docker)\n\nUseful links\n\nPlugin Documentation\n\nJenkins Plugin Site\n\nJenkins Wiki Exporter tool","title":"Plugin Documentation-as-Code: Moving docs to GitHub","tags":["hacktoberfest","developer","documentation","wiki","contributors"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"developer","limit":8,"skip":8,"numPages":5,"currentPage":2}},
