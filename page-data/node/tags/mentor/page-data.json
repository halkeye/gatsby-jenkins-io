the mentor summit and the project retrospectives finished in October,\nnow we can call Google Summer of Code 2020 officially over in the Jenkins community.\nOn behalf of the Jenkins org team, we would like to thank all participants: students, mentors, applicants, and dozens of other contributors who participated in the project this year.\nGoogle Summer of Code would not be successful without the active participation of the Jenkins community.\n\nIf you follow the Jenkins blog, you may have already seen many GSoC 2020 articles created by the project teams.\nHere I would like to focus on the key highlights from the project.\n\nProjects\n\nIn 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.\nWe had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.\nAs usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.\nThe projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes\nneeded for long-term evolution of Jenkins.\n\nHere are the projects we had this year:\n\nCustom Jenkins distribution build service by Sladyn Nunes\n\nExternal Fingerprint Storage by Sumit Sarin\n\nGit Plugin Performance Improvements by Rishabh Budhouliya\n\nGitHub Checks API for Jenkins Plugins by Kezhi Xiong\n\nJenkins X: Apps/Addons consolidation by Zixuan Liu\n\nMachine Learning Plugins for Data Science by Loghi Perinpanayagam\n\nJenkins Windows Services: YAML Configuration Support by Buddhika Chathuranga\n\nPlease refer to the project pages for more information, links to the blog posts, and project demos.\nLet‚Äôs focus on the results instead.\nThis is the first ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.\nIt was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!\n\n.\n\nThanks a lot to all mentors who were guiding students during their projects:\nZhao Xiaojie,\nKristin Whetstone,\nParichay Barpanda,\nMartin d‚ÄôAnjou,\nOleg Nenashev,\nAndrey Falko,\nMike Cirioli,\nMark Waite,\nFrancisco Fernandez,\nJustin Harringa,\nOmkar Deshpande,\nUlli Hafner,\nTim Jacomb,\nKara de la Marck,\nJames Strachan,\nNeha Gupta,\nOscar Medina,\nNikhil Da Rocha,\nSahil Kalra,\nBruno P. Kinoshita,\nIoannis Moutsatsos,\nMarky Jackson,\nShivay Lamba, and\nNext Turn.\n\nGSoC 2020 Org admin team:\nKara de la Marck,\nMartin d‚ÄôAnjou,\nMarky Jackson,\nOleg Nenashev.\n\nEvents\n\nThanks to the GSoC organization stipend from Google and other donations,\nthe Jenkins project usually provides travel grants to successful students so that they can visit a major community event, meet their mentors and community members in person, and present their work there.\nHere are some notes about the GSoC 2019 travel.\nUnfortunately this year it was not possible, and GSoC went completely virtual this year.\n\nOnline meetups\n\nIn August we organized Jenkins Online Meetups where students have presented their projects\n( part 1, part 2).\nYou can find recordings of these presentations in this playlist on the Jenkins YouTube channel.\n\nDevOps World\n\nThis year CloudBees, one of the Jenkins corporate sponsors, invited all students to participate in the DevOps World virtual conference on September 23-25.\nGSoC students did lighting talks about their projects, attended other conference talks, and joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation booth which represented the project at the conference.\nYou can find recordings of the talks and all materials here.\nAlthough the conference was in September, the talks were pre-recorded in early August.\nPlease refer to the Jenkins online meetup recordings for the recent versions.\n\nGSoC Mentor summit\n\nThis is a regular gathering for Google Summer of Code mentors and org admins where they share their experiences about GSoC, outreach programs, community management, and tools.\nUsually it is organized as a multi-day unconference after the end of GSoC, with 2-3 representatives from each project.\nIt has been a great learning experience to participate in it.\nThis year it was a single-day virtual event, and all mentors were able to attend.\nShivay Lamba, one of the GSoC 2020 mentors, also did a lightning talk about the GSoC projects he was working on in Jenkins and CNCF ( slides).\n\nSwag\n\nAll Google Summer of Code students and mentors get swag from Google.\nThis year, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) has sponsored swag for 50 most active GSoC participants:\nall students, mentors, and many other contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.\nThis is the third year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag,\nIn the previous years the swag logistics was one of the most challenging tasks for org admins during the entire project.\nand we highly appreciate help from CDF with this part.\nAs DevOps World presenters, the students have also received special edition speaker swag from CloudBees.\n\nThanks a lot to Google, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) and CloudBees!\n\nRetrospective\n\nAfter completion of the coding phases,\norg admins have reached out to all GSoC 2020 participants to gather their feedback and suggestions.\nWe also recommended that project teams hold their own retrospective meetings.\nSuch information is instrumental to continuously improving GSoC in the Jenkins community.\nWe thank all contributors who shared their feedback!\n\nThe organization-wide retrospective was organized as a survey and a series of retrospective meetings.\nYou can find aggregated results in this Google Doc.\nOverall, we received very positive feedback from students and mentors.\nThe GSoC framework in Jenkins has matured significantly during the previous years.\nThe effort we invested to create guidelines and recommendations for all parties helped a lot because all the expectations were known in advance.\nAs usual, there is much to improve, especially with regards to the community bonding phases and cross-project communications.\nWe are processing the feedback, and we will expand our documentation and the contributor onboarding plans next year.\n\nSome personal notes\n\nI have been involved in leading and coordinating Google Summer of Code in open source projects since 2016.\nThis year I visited the GSoC stand at FOSDEM and met a few organizers and former students.\nA few days after, I proposed participating in GSoC at the Jenkins contributor summit in Brussels,\nand several contributors supported this idea.\nWe spent several hours to create the first Jenkins GSoC page and brainstorm on project ideas.\nWe submitted our application and were accepted.\nThanks a lot to the Google team that gave us a chance!\n\nIt is great to work with the students and see how they explore the open source community and grow professionally as engineers.\nIt is also awesome to see how some of them stay in the project and keep contributing,\nincluding becoming plugin maintainers and GSoC mentors.\nBut, for me, Google Summer of Code is not just about mentoring.\nIt also helps a lot with the community bonding‚Ä¶‚Äã for the existing community like Jenkins which has a lot of isolated sub-communities in plugins.\nMany maintainers work alone, and it can be quite lonely working to maintain a plugin without feedback, developer ideas, and user interactions.\nWhen plugin contributors become project mentors, they join the wider community effort and work in teams.\nIn many cases they start contributing to the organization-wide activities and goals,\nand it grows the \"backbone\" of the Jenkins community.\nLike other community-driven projects, we need such backbone to scale the community and onboard more contributors to the countless Jenkins components.\nSo far it works really well and GSoC excels among outreach programs in this regard.\n\nI would like to thank the Google Open Source team, students and all Jenkins community members for the great Google Summer of Code this year.\nWe also thank the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help to recognize contributors and allow organization administrators to focus on projects.\nLast but not least, I would like to thank the Jenkins org admin team:\nMartin d‚ÄôAnjou,\nMarky Jackson, and\nKara de la Marck.\nThis was a crazy year for everyone. Regardless of that, the org admins stepped up and took responsibility for students and mentors involved in the project, with a serious time commitment.\nNot all work by the organizers is publicly visible (applications, project selection, resolving conflicts),\nbut this work is essential to the project‚Äôs success.\nThanks a lot to org admins and mentors who helped with the administrative tasks this year!\n\nWhat‚Äôs about GSoC 2021?\n\nYes, we plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021.\nThe application period for organizations will start in a few months,\nbut we have already started preparing for the next GSoC session.\nWe are looking for mentors, org admins and project ideas.\nPlease contact us if you are interested!\n\nCall for Mentors and Project Ideas\n\nGSoC 2021 project ideas\n\nHOWTO: Propose a project idea\n\nInformation for mentors : guidelines and expectations\n\nWe invite potential students to start exploring the project and the available project ideas.\nOriginal ideas are always welcome in the project, and starting early is a great opportunity to\nget introduced to the Jenkins community, collect more information about the problem areas,\nand to create a good proposal.\n\"Start early\" is the most popular recommendation from GSoC 2020 participants to future GSoC students,\nand we encourage you to follow this advice!","title":"Google Summer of Code 2020 summary","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2020","jenkins","community","events","mentor"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member, open source software and open hardware advocate, TOC chair in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he maintains [Jenkinsfile Runner](<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/\" class=\"bare\">https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/</a>),\ncontributes to several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a> and outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>)\nand organizes <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works on open source programs and [Keptn](<a href=\"https://keptn.sh/\" class=\"bare\">https://keptn.sh/</a>) at the [Dynatrace](<a href=\"https://dynatrace.com\" class=\"bare\">https://dynatrace.com</a>), Open Source Program Office.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","id":"1aef3427-db0e-553e-8196-ae1a3516d783","slug":"/blog/2019/10/08/google-summer-of-code-mentor-and-org-admin-perspective/","strippedHtml":"I was fortunate enough to participate in the Google Summer of Code 2019 as a mentor and org admin. This was great\nand I wanted to share in hopes of encouraging more people to join.\nYou can learn more about the Google Summer of Code here: https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/\n\nCommunity Bonding\n\nThe first phase of the project is the community bonding phase. This is where the student and other mentors come together\nto lay out the plan for the project. It is important to set expectations and ensure that the student is well aware of\nwhat will take place and also made to feel welcome.\n\nParichay Barpanda was the student and he was super awesome from the get go. The project he was working on was the Gitlab\nBranch Source Plugin. More can be found here: jenkinsci/gitlab-branch-source-plugin\n\nFrom the mentor side it was myself and Justin Harringa. Justin was just amazing throughout this project and I seriously\ncould not have done this without him. He was encouraging, empathetic and just all around great. I would gladly serve\nwith him again.\n\nWe laid out our plan and guidance and got to work.\n\nFirst Evaluations\n\nThe first evaluation was quickly upon us and Parichay was ready!\nThe work he put in was nothing shy of amazing. We did our 1st demo and he really rocked it. A video of that demo can be\nfound on : Youtube\n\nSecond Evaluations\n\nThere was not much time to rest before we realized that phase II end was upon us but Parichay was ready. Again, he\nnailed it.\n\nThat demo can be found here\n\nMentors Submit Final Evaluations\n\nWe had our final evaluation and at this point Parichay was seasoned. He was getting issues assigned to him, working on\nlittle bug fixes and setting his roadmap for features. He absolutely blew Justin and I away.\n\nParichay‚Äôs final evaluation demo can be seen here\n\nAt the conclusion of the final demo‚Äôs, Justin and I met and went over Parichay‚Äôs final evaluation. At this point we had\nmet twice a week for several months, we have reviewed code daily, we had community involvement and most of all we had\nseen Parichay grow into a seasoned software developer.\n\nJustin and I were without a doubt passing Parichay on his entire body of work. I am actually tearing up typing this\nbecause I am so proud of Parichay.\n\nOrg Admin\n\nBeing an org admin for the 2019 Google Summer of Code project for the Jenkins organization was truly rewarding and couldn‚Äôt\nhave been accomplished without the help from Oleg Nenashev, Martin d‚ÄôAnjou, Jeff Pearce and Lloyd Chang.\n\nAs an org admin we handled issues with mentors, community members and disagreements involving work. These items were only\na few and as a team we handled them accordingly.\n\nWe regularly met to discuss and plan. Coordinating and dealing with a project like Google Summer of Code is no small feat\nbut this team made it super easy and I am so thankful for them and all that I learned.\n\nClosing\n\nIn looking back at this experience I am so grateful for the opportunity I was given. This was such a rewarding experience\nto not only be able to mentor but also be an org admin. Not only will I be back next year (we are already in the\nplanning stages) but I highly encourage people reading this to consider joining. You will not be disappointed.\n\nI am so thankful for all the students, mentors and fellow org admins. Your dedication to open source is so valued. You\nshowed and continue to show what this project is all about, and that is being welcoming, open and transparent. Helping\npeople grow as individuals while learning skills is what I love about this community.\n\nThank you to everyone and I hope your futures are bright!","title":"Google Summer of Code Mentor and Org Admin Perspective","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2019","jenkins","community","events","mentor"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!
