Fond of agility, I‚Äôm part of the organization committee of the Agile Tour Bordeaux since 2020.\n\nI also like to engage in sporting challenges: I swam across the Garonne (a big river in the south of France) and finished 2 triathlons.\nKeeping the best for the end: I‚Äôm the mother of two kids who taught me it‚Äôs possible to speak about Pokemon with one, while drawing a unicorn with the other.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nDuring my studies, I met quite a lot of ‚Äúnerds / geeks‚Äù contributing to Linux distributions (Gentoo & Debian).\nTheir technical skills seemed higher than mine and the Open Source universe looked inaccessible to me.\nConcerning Jenkins, I am a user (now contributor) of it, but not an administrator.\n\nWhat motivated you to participate in that hackathon?\n\nI dared to participate thanks to the Duchess (and mainly Ang√©lique, thanks to her).\nHaving the support and backing of the community was my motivation.\n\nWhat will you remember from this experience?\n\nFrom a professional point of view, I perfected my knowledge of Git, and I had a chance to overview part of the quality processes from Open Source projects.\nMy first Pull Request was approved by‚Ä¶ 9 people!\nThe fourth reviewer did find an issue.\nWho can tell me code review isn‚Äôt useful now?\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I remember two things.\nThe first one: Open Source communities are not elitist communities.\nEvery contribution matters, even small ones.\nThe people I met were positive and benevolent.\nThe second one could be illustrated by a quote from Grace Hopper: ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a good idea, go ahead and do it. It‚Äôs much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.‚Äù.\n\nDo you have anything more to say?\n\nAfter Jenkins, I also submitted Pull Requests to others Open Source projects.\nThe problem: with such a diversity of Open Source projects, how to organize your time?\n\nAnne-Laure Gaillard contributions during hacktoberfest\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5779\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5785\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5804\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5806\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5807\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5808\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5822\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5823\n\nhttps://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/pull/25\n\nhttps://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/pull/23\n\nhttps://github.com/sarequl/Netflix-Helper/pull/6\n\nBertha Torres Interview\n\nTwitter: @tatoberres\n\nLinkedIn\n\nHello Bertha, can you introduce yourself?\n\nComing from a literature training and as a language teacher for more than 15 years, it‚Äôs while moving to a high mountain area that a need to explore other skills set in.\n\nThus, a self-taught training followed by a validated file for financing diploma training followed one another and confirmed to me that life is too short to waste it on what does not make sense to us.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nParticipating in Open Source appeared to me in that exploratory process like a learning opportunity‚Ä¶\nwhich I thought was inaccessible of course! I didn‚Äôt see myself writing code.\n\nBut thanks to the Duchess France community, I learned how to contribute at my level and to understand the contribution process.\nIt‚Äôll allow me as things progress to contribute in more domains.\n\nCan you tell us how the woman version of Jenkins was born?\n\nWell‚Ä¶ In the presentation video for Hacktoberfest, the artwork was mentioned ( https://www.jenkins.io/artwork/) and Ang√©lique also mentioned it during the first meeting‚Ä¶\nAnd one must admit that looking at it, you can see a lot of different things but women.\n\nSo I imagined a governess, very confident, efficient, very clever, scrupulously combed, nicely dressed, who might represent the personality of what Jenkins is made of.\n\nDo you have anything to add?\n\nThis time I was able to participate through Pull Requests related to translation and drawing. I‚Äôll probably do it again!\n\nBertha Torres contributions during hacktoberfest\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/4627\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5796\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5797\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/214\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/215\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ant-plugin/pull/78\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ant-plugin/pull/77\n\nPauline Iogna‚Äôs Interview\n\nTwitter: @pauline_io\n\nHello Pauline, can you introduce yourself?\n\nI‚Äôm a backend developer in Java/Scala, and an active member of Duchess France.\n\nWhat did you think about Open Source, and maybe Jenkins, before starting the hackathon?\n\nI didn‚Äôt really have an opinion about Jenkins before doing the hackathon.\nLike many other people, I‚Äôm a Jenkins user but I didn‚Äôt know its source code.\n\nWhat motivated you to participate in this hackathon?\n\nActually participating in Hacktoberfest.\nJust bringing a contribution, even modest, on an open source project.\n\nWhat did you discover through that hackathon?\n\nTechnically, I discovered how to do MVC with Apache Jelly.\nI also rediscovered the contribution process of Open Source projects.\n\nThe Hacktoberfest mechanism is really well thought out for onboarding people wanting to start working on Open Source projects.\nWith Ang√©lique‚Äôs help on top of that to animate sessions on the Duchess France Slack channel, we had the best conditions to contribute to that important project.\n\nWhat will you remember from this experience?\n\nIt‚Äôs not that simple to contribute to a project you‚Äôre just discovering, it requires a bit of investment and patience.\nOn Jenkins, the contributors are really reactive and the Pull Requests are quickly reviewed.\nThe feedback is useful and benevolent.\nThere is one Jira project listing all the features and bugs to be worked on for the project.\nSome tickets are flagged as ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù allowing those who are beginners to pick easily and quickly doable tickets.\n\nPauline Iogna contributions\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5835\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5793\n\nA few words about the organization within Duchess France\n\nThe framework was intentionally simple and flexible. We started with an online kick start meeting for describing a bit of context, and more precisely the Jenkins universe.\n\nOnline kick start meeting for context\n\nThen, we mainly exchanged through the Duchess Slack channel in an asynchronous way on a dedicated channel, as well as a 30 minutes meeting each Friday during October.","title":"Interview of Duchess contributors for hacktoberfest 2021 on Jenkins","tags":["jenkins","hacktoberfest","developer","newcomer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/19e71/ajard.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/77b35/ajard.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/d4a57/ajard.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/19e71/ajard.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/68974/ajard.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/ef6ff/ajard.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/8257c/ajard.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/6766a/ajard.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/991545e7fbe587409ec80b375ee7057f/22bfc/ajard.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"aHenryJard","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Ang√©lique is a software developer since 2006, Jenkins user since ever and plugins developer since 2019.

project started the migration of plugin documentation to GitHub almost two years ago.\nHacktoberfest 2021 identified 40 candidate plugins to migrate their documentation to GitHub.\nDan Heath,\nDeepak Gupta,\nAvinash Upadhyaya K R,\nRajan Kumar Singh, and\nDheeraj Singh Jodha provided a total of 29 pull requests migrating plugin documentation to GitHub.\n\nSpecial thanks to the contributors and to the plugin maintainers that merged and released documentation migration pull requests.\nEight plugins have fully migrated their documentation to GitHub through Hacktoberfest contributions.\nAn additional thirteen plugins have merged the documentation change and will complete the migration with their next plugin release.\n\nThe plugin documentation migration was coordinated through a worksheet.\nA tutorial video describing the documentation migration process is also available.\n\nImplementing Content Security Policy\n\nWadeck Follonier provided a tutorial to prepare Jenkins for a broader implementation of Content Security Policy.\nSix contributors provided pull requests to Jenkins core to create separate JavaScript files from JavaScript that was previously implemented inside the Jenkins 'jelly' files.\nMoving JavaScript into separate files prepares Jenkins to implement Content Security Policy protections against JavaScript embedded in HTML.\n\nJenkins Architecture Diagrams\n\nAng√©lique Jard provided architectural diagrams showing a dataflow view of Jenkins and a high level view of Jenkins.\nThose diagrams help others understand the internal structure of Jenkins and how it interacts with users and with other systems.\n\nModernizing Plugins Video Series\n\nDarin Pope created five videos illustrating some of the small steps that a new contributor can use to help modernize a plugin.\nAdditional plugin modernization and adoption ideas are included in the\"Contributing to Open Source\" workshop from DevOps World 2021.\n\nModernizing Jenkins Plugins\n\nThanks to All\n\nWe offer our most sincere thanks to all Hacktoberfest contributors and to the many pull request reviewers.","title":"Jenkins in Hacktoberfest

September 2019 we announced\nsupport of GitHub as a source of documentation for the Jenkins Plugin Site.\nThanks to Zbynek Konecny and Olivier Vernin and other contributors,\nnow it is possible to store plugin documentation right inside plugin repositories instead of Jenkins Wiki which was historically difficult to maintain for plugin maintainers and for the Jenkins infrastructure team.\n\nThis blogpost may be interesting to plugin maintainers and to those who want to contribute to the Jenkins documentation.\nI will describe how to migrate plugin documentation to GitHub and to get pages like this one:\n\nWhy?\n\nBy using plugin GitHub repositories for documentation,\nplugin maintainers can follow the Documentation-as-code approach and make documentation changes a part of the pull requests so that documentation follow-ups do not get forgotten.\nIt also gives an opportunity to review the documentation changes and to add documentation contributor recognition, especially if the story is combined with Release Drafter.\n\nUnfortunately, before September 2019 usage of GitHub documentation was causing some issues.\nFirst of all, many plugin maintainers have already moved their documentation to GitHub, and it caused fragmentation of the documentation (Wiki, GitHub, jenkins.io).\nTo address it, plugin maintainers still had to maintain stub Wiki pages with redirects,\nand users had to spend some time to find out where the real documentation is located.\nBy supporting GitHub as a documentation source, we allow maintainers to phase out the plugin Wiki pages while improving the user experience.\n\nAnd there are even more pressing reasons to do the migration now‚Ä¶‚Äã\nIf you are subscribed to the developer mailing list,\nyou may have also seen an announcement by R. Tyler Croy about Jenkins Wiki stability issues\nand making it read-only as a temporary measure to stabilize the instance\n( mailing list thread).\nAlthough the functionality has been partially restored afterwards,\nthere is a consensus in the Infrastructure team that we should gradually move to alternate solutions.\n\nExamples\n\nSince the announcement in September, more than 50 plugins were moved from Wiki to GitHub.\nFew examples:\n\nConfiguration as Code Plugin\n\nMailer Plugin\n\nGradle Plugin\n\nRole Strategy Plugin\n\nHow to enable GitHub documentation for your plugin?\n\nConvert documentation from Wiki to GitHub Asciidoc or Markdown format if you have not done it yet.\n\nIt can be easily done in a semi-automatic way using Jenkins Wiki Exporter\n\nSee the guidelines\nhere.\n\nChange the field in pom.xml so that it points to GitHub\n( guide).\n Examples of valid links:\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/mailer-plugin - plugin site will use GitHub REST API to extract README\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ssh-credentials-plugin/blob/master/doc/README.md - extraction of a plugin page from a custom location\n\nOptional: Add badges to the page to improve look&feel and to provide quick links for users.\nThere are standard badges for changelogs, chats, plugin site, and installation numbers.\n\nExample for Markdown\n\nExample for Asciidoc\n\nRelease the new plugin version\n\nWait a few hours till the change propagates.\nAfter that, the Jenkins Plugin Site will show the new documentation from GitHub.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\n\nThe story is tracked as jira:WEBSITE-406[] which is a part of the wider subproject for using GitHub as a source of data for the Jenkins plugin site and update managers (jira:WEBSITE-637[]).\nLater steps include support showing changelogs from GitHub releases, pulling plugin tags from GitHub, showing plugin logos, and using Repository Permission Updater as a source of the maintainer information.\n\nHow to contribute?\n\nOctober is a great time to contribute!\nPlugin documentation is one of the featured projects for Hacktoberfest,\nand we will welcome all contributions to the documentation and to the codebase.\n\nContributing to Documentation\n\nWe are looking for contributors who are interested to improve plugin documentation and to help us with migration from Wiki to GitHub.\nFor dozens of plugins the documentation is already in GitHub,\nand you are welcome to submit pull requests against any repository.\n\nMigrating documentation:\n\nMigrating plugin documentation from Wiki to GitHub\n\nMoving documentation from Jenkins Wiki to jenkins.io\n\njira:JENKINS-59467[Template issue for plugin docs migration]\n\nNewbie-friendly documentation tasks\n\nIf you have any questions about contributing to the documentation,\nplease see this page or reach out to us in the Docs SIG Gitter chat.\n\nCode contributions\n\nWould you like to write some code in Java or JavaScript?\nOr would you like to work on CSS styles and improve Jenkins design?\nIn such case you are welcome to contribute to the Jenkins Plugin Site.\nIt is our own plugin marketplace implementation, and we invite contributions to this area.\nThe plugin site is really easy to develop.\n\njira:WEBSITE-637[] -
