Maybe a new plugin is needed, or I need to update an existing plugin.\nOr, I want to upload a plugin from my computer. For all these cases, I just don’t need a UI or even a browser.\nI like to use a CLI to complete most of my tasks. For example, I use kubectl to manage my Kubernetes cluster,\nto create or modify the kubernetes resources. So, I start to think, 'Why not use a CLI to manage my Jenkins?'.\n\nWhy create a new one?\n\nFirst, I almost forgot about the existing Jenkins CLI, written in Java. Let me introduce how to use that one.\n\nVisit Jenkins page from http://localhost:8080/jenkins/cli/ . You’ll see a command like java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/jenkins/ help. So, a jar file needs to be download.\nWe can use this command to complete this task wget http://localhost:8080/jenkins/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar .\n\nNow you can see that this is not a Linux-style CLI. Please consider some points below:\n\nThe users must have a JRE. This is not convenient for developers who don’t use Java.\n\nThe CLI is too wordy. We always need to type java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/jenkins/ as the initial command.\n\nCannot install it by some popular package manager, like brew or yum.\n\nOf course, the Java CLI client is more native with Jenkins. But I’d like to use this more easily.\nSo I decided to create a new CLI tool which would be written in Go and which would natively run on modern platforms.\n\nThat’s the story of creating jcli.\n\nFeatures\n\nEasy to maintain config file for jcli\n\nMultiple Jenkins support\n\nPlugins management (list, search, install, upload)\n\nJob management (search, build, log)\n\nOpen your Jenkins with a browser\n\nRestart your Jenkins\n\nConnection with proxy support\n\nHow to get it?\n\nYou can clone jcli from the jenkins-cli repo. For now, we support\nthese three most popular OS platforms: MacOS, Linux, and Windows.\n\nMacOS\n\nYou can use brew to install jcli.\n\nbrew tap jenkins-zh/jcli\nbrew install jcli\n\nLinux\n\nIt’s very simple to install jcli into your Linux OS. Just need to execute a command line at below:\n\ncurl -L https://github.com/jenkins-zh/jenkins-cli/releases/latest/download/jcli-linux-amd64.tar.gz|tar xzv\nsudo mv jcli /usr/local/bin/\n\nWindows\n\nYou can find the latest version by clicking here. Then download the tar file, cp the uncompressed jcli directory into your system path.\n\nHow to get started?\n\nIt’s very simple to use this. Once you get jcli on your computer, use this command to generate a sample configuration:\n\n$ jcli config generate\ncurrent: yourServer\njenkins_servers:\n- name: yourServer\n  url: http://localhost:8080/jenkins\n  username: admin\n  token: 111e3a2f0231198855dceaff96f20540a9\n  proxy: \"\"\n  proxyAuth: \"\"\n# Goto 'http://localhost:8080/jenkins/me/configure', then you can generate your token.\n\nIn most cases, you should modify three fields which are url, username and token. OK, I believe you’re ready. Please check whether you install the github plugin in your Jenkins:\n\njcli plugin list --filter name=github\n\nThat’s the end. It’s still in very early development stage.

In particular, we’ve been focusing on getting the tool ready to\nincorporate into the Jenkins Docker Image to replace the\ninstall-plugins.sh bash script\nto download plugins.  This work included parsing improvements so that blank lines and comments in the\nplugins.txt file are filtered out, allowing update centers and the plugin download\ndirectory to be set via environment variables or CLI Options, creating Windows\ncompatible defaults, and fixing a bug in which dependencies for specific\nplugin versions were not always getting resolved correctly.\n\nIn parallel to getting the tool ready for Jenkins Docker integration, Phase 2 saw\nthe addition of several new features.\n\nYaml Input\n\nIn addition to specifying the plugins they want to download via the --plugins\nCLI option or through a .txt file, users can now use a Jenkins yaml file with a\nplugins root element.\n\nSay goodbye to the days of specifying incremental\nplugins like incrementals;org.jenkins-ci.plugins.workflow;2.20-rc530.b4f7f7869384 -\n  you can enter the artifactId, groupId, and version to specify an incremental plugin.\n\nMaking the Download Process More Transparent\n\nPreviously, the plugin download process was not very transparent to users - it was\ndifficult to know the final set of plugins that would be downloaded after pulling in\nall the dependencies.  Instead of determing the set of plugins that will be downloaded\nat the time of download, users now have the option to see the full set of plugins\nand their versions that will be downloaded in advance. With the --list CLI\noption, users can see all currently downloaded and bundled plugins, the set of all\nplugins that will be downloaded, and the effective plugin set - the set of all\nplugins that are already downloaded or will be downloaded.\n\nViewing Information About plugins\n\nNow that you know which plugins will be downloaded, wouldn’t it be nice to know\nif these are the latest versions or if any of the versions you want to install have\nsecurity warnings?  You can do that now too.\n\nNext Steps and Additional Information\n\nThe updates mentioned in this blog will be released soon so you can try them out.\nThe focus of Phase 3 will be to continue to iterate upon and improve the library\nand CLI. We hope to release a first version and submit a pull request to Jenkins Docker soon.\nThanks to everyone who has already tried it out and given feedback! I will also be\npresenting my work at DevOps World\nin San Francisco in a few weeks.  You can use the code PREVIEW for a discounted registration\n($799 instead of $1,499).\n\nFeel free to reach out through\nthe Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list. I would love to get your questions, comments, and feedback!\nWe have meetings Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6PM UTC.\n\nPhase 2 Presentation Slides\n\nPhase 2 Recorded Demo\n\nJira Issue Search\n\nRepository","title":"Plugin Management Library and CLI Tool Phase 2 GSoC Updates","tags":["plugins","pluginmanagement","platform-sig","cli","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#280818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/405b9/stopalopa.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7b6be/stopalopa.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/ebcfb/stopalopa.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/0ade5/stopalopa.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/5b0b1/stopalopa.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/96834/stopalopa.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/805f6/stopalopa.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":184}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/stopalopa.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"stopalopa","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Natasha is a Master&#8217;s student at Penn State University.

We instead decided to start by converting the\ninstall-plugins.sh bash script in Jenkins Docker to Java.\nThere are several issues with the install-plugins.sh script - namely, that it is a bash script and has limited extensibility.\nFurthermore, it does not retrieve all of the most-up-to-date update center metadata.\n\nAlpha Release Details\n\nMimicking what was done in the install-plugins.sh script from the official Jenkins Docker image, the new plugin management library takes in a list of plugins, their versions,\nand/or urls from which to download the plugins, and downloads the requested plugins and their dependencies. The plugins are downloaded from the update center\nto a specified directory, and can then be loaded into Jenkins. Currently, the plugins to be downloaded can be specified via a plugins.txt file and/or the -plugins cli option, but we plan to further expand the input formats that can be accepted.\nCustom version specifiers for different update centers are also supported.\n\nThe library will first check if any of the requested plugins are currently either installed in the user-specified download location or user-specified Jenkins war file.\nAlready installed plugins will be ignored or upgraded if a higher version is requested or required as a dependency.  After determining the plugin download URL, the library\nwill download the plugins and resolve and download their dependencies.\n\nThis is just the beginning: the plugin manager library and cli tool are very much still a work in progress.\nFor the most up-to-date information on CLI options and how to run the tool, see the repository README.md.\nMore robust input parsing, support for security warnings and available updates, Docker integration, and additional features coming soon!\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nFeel free to reach out through\nthe Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list.
