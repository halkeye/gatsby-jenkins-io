Thus, Jetstack/cert-manager is used to provision TLS certificates and establish connection between Kubernetes API and webhook.\n\nImplementaion\n\nOperator-SDK takes care of creating a new webhook and appending it to the manager and creating handlers.\nTls certificates are managed using cert-manager.\n\nValidation Logic:\n\nProposed Implementations: Iterate through the list of plugins to be installed and fetch warnings for each plugin from the plugin center API and check if the version of that plugin has any of those warnings.\n\nCaveats: Webhooks add latency to an API request, hence they should evaluate as quickly as possible thus having max allowed timeout of 30s. In the earlier approach I was fetching the security warnings from the plugin site API in the validator interface itself, and since network operations are slow, it was causing a timeout in the case of validating a larger number of plugins or when the Internet connection was not good.\n\nUpdated Implementaion: Instead of fetching information for each plugin, the information about all the plugins is downloaded and cached at the start of the operator and updated periodically, thus eliminating network calls and finishing validation in less than a second.\n\nEvaluation Phase 1:\n\nScaffoled a new validation webhook\n\nAdded manifests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, certificates and volumes, and updated Makefile\n\nImplemented the validator interface\n\nUpdated helm charts\n\nEvaluation Phase 2:\n\nReimplemented the validator interface.\n\nAdded unit tests for internal functions\n\nAdded e2e tests along with helm tests\n\nUpdated helm charts\n\nResources\n\nPull Requests\n\nAdded validation webhook,manifests,and updated Makefile\n\nImplemented validation logic,added tests and updated helm charts\n\nPhase 1 demo\n\nUser Guide\n\nThe webhook feature is completely optional for the user. It can be easily deployed using Helm Chart by setting webhook.enabled in values.yaml and in the Operator command line flag.\n\nwebhook.enabled=true\n\nTo enable security validation in the jenkins custom resource set\n\njenkins.ValidateSecurityWarnings=true\n\nNote: The webhook takes some time to get up and running, also when helm renders the template, the validating webhook configuration is applied last, hence if the user wants to deploy the Jenkins Custom Resource with validation turned on, he needs to wait for some time. After the webhook is up and running the user can deploy the Jenkins Custom Resource using helm or kubectl\n\nFuture work\n\nImplementing a post-install hook in the helm charts that checks whether the webhook is up and running.\n\nAdding validation for required core version of plugin and core version of Jenkins.\n\nMigrating other validation logic from controller to the webhook.\n\nAdding validation for the dependencies of the plugins.","title":"Security Validator for Jenkins Operator for Kubernetes","tags":["gsoc21","kubernetes","security","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a88848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/67151/sharmapulkit04.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/ede19/sharmapulkit04.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/bc20c/sharmapulkit04.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/67151/sharmapulkit04.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/f76df/sharmapulkit04.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/8ba60/sharmapulkit04.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/a9ea7/sharmapulkit04.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/8c23b/sharmapulkit04.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a0f57d401b1a73bd732b30a1dfa27287/fc98a/sharmapulkit04.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":131}}},"blog":null,"github":"sharmapulkit04","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A Student at the Indian Institute of Technology(BHU) Varanasi, Pulkit is currently working on a GSoC Project under Jenkins where he aims to add a security validator to the Jenkins Kubernetes Operator.</p>\n</div>","id":"sharmapulkit04","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Pulkit Sharma","slug":"/blog/author/sharmapulkit04","twitter":"anarchist_04"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"be129944-4fa0-5e51-a899-a198162b78c4","slug":"/blog/2021/04/21/tekton-plugin/","strippedHtml":"What is Tekton?\n\nTekton is a powerful and flexible open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy across cloud providers and on-premises systems.\n\nWhy use Tekton?\n\nTekton pipelines have a number of benefits:\n\nthey are cloud native and designed from the ground up for kubernetes\n\neach Tekton Pipeline is fully declarative and completely self described; it does not depend on any separate out of band Jenkins controllers, plugins or plugin/controller configurations\n\neach Pipeline Task runs as a stand alone kubernetes Pod which is completely independent of any other pods and pipelines and are fully scheduled by Kubernetes to maximise resilience and optimize resource usage. A bad pipeline cannot take down another one & the kubernetes scheduler manages them all\n\neach step can be any command in any container image with whatever secrets, volume mounts, environment variables and resource limits you need\n\nthere is no need to bundle a JVM or Jenkins Remoting container into the pod so you can keep resources and cost down\n\nWhy use Jenkins and Tekton together?\n\nJenkins is the most popular open source automation server around. Lots of developers use it every day to get things done.\nJenkins can now be used to automate Tekton pipelines too which helps teams digitally transform to more cloud native solutions for their CI and CD.\nIn such a case, you can use Tekton pipeline engine while getting all benefits from Jenkins as an orchestrator, user interface and the reporting engine.\n\nIntroducing the Tekton Plugin for Jenkins\n\nThe Tekton Client plugin for Jenkins lets you easily use Jenkins to automate creating and running Tekton pipelines.\nIt bridges the Kubernetes learning gap and allows invoking Tekton Pipelines and resources through Jenkins.\nThis allows users to not have much of the Kubernetes specific knowledge beforehand and work.\n\nIts a single Jenkins plugin to install - so itâ€™s easy to use.\n\nFor background check out the  blog post Bridging the Gap with Tekton-client-plugin for Jenkins by the founder of the plugin Vibhav Bobade.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe Tekton Client plugin for jenkins assumes you have access to a kubernetes cluster.\n\nThe kubernetes cluster should have Tekton pipelines installed.\n\nIf you have not yet installed Tekton you could use this tekton helm chart\n\nThe Jenkins controller should also have kubernetes RBAC access to be able to create Tekton resources and watch them and their associated pods and pod logs.\n\nIf you are running your Jenkins controller inside Kubernetes then an easy way to setup the RBAC is to install the Jenkins Resource Helm Chart in the same namespace as your Jenkins controller.\n\nAnother option is to use an installation of Jenkins X and let it setup a Jenkins controller via GitOps\n\nSpecifying the Tekton pipelines\n\nYou can configure the Tekton pipeline via:\n\na file path in a git clone block\n\na URL to a tekton YAML file\n\na block of YAML\n\nWe recommend defining Tekton pipelines as YAML files and checking them into a git repository so that you can use GitOps and follow the Pipeline As Code pattern.\n\nThis means that you can version your pipelines in git. It also means you can benefit from the various IDE plugins available for Tekton such as VS Code and IDEA so that you get auto completion, formatting and validation while editing the YAML.\n\nSo you can use the usual Git provider support in Jenkins to clone the git repository that contains then Tekton YAML file then reference the file by name.\n\nReusing Pipelines from the Tekton Catalog\n\nThe Tekton Catalog defines a ton of Tekton Tasks you can reuse in your pipelines\n\nWe have found when it comes to a microsevices style architecture you end up with lots of repositories and pipelines. Then using a Pipeline As Code pattern with GitOps we want to Version Everything but also make it easy for any repository to use any version of any task or pipeline.\n\ne.g. you may have many repositories using the current version of a pipeline but want to try out a new change to the pipeline in just 1 repository to verify it works well; then if it does, incrementally roll that change out to more repositories.\n\nThis can make it hard trying to reuse as much as you can across the different git repositories while also minimising the number of versions and forks of git repositories you have and simplifying the maintenance of all of the pipelines.\n\nWe have found on the Jenkins X project that a nice way to do this via GitOps such that we reference versioned Tekton Tasks and Pipelines in git so that they are easy to reuse or override.\n\nSo we reuse Tasks and Pipelines via the uses: image notation which lets us keep all of our Tekton Tasks and Pipelines in vanilla Tekton YAML; so that the IDE completion and validation works - but we can easily reuse Tasks or steps from libraries while also Versioning Everything\n\nNote that if wish to reuse steps/tasks via the uses: image notation then you must click the Tekton Catalog flag in your Job definition which will then resolve the uses: clause with the actual step/task.\n\nWhat is Jenkins X?\n\nThe Jenkins X project automates your CI/CD on kubernetes to help you accelerate :\n\nAutomated CI/CD pipelines lets you focus on your actually application code while Jenkins X automatically creates battle tested Tekton CI/CD pipelines for your project which are managed via GitOps so that its super easy to keep your pipelines up to date across your repositories or to upgrade or override pipelines or steps for specific repositories.\n\nAutomatic promotion of versioned artifacts via GitOps through your Environments such as Staging, Pre-production and Production whether they are running in the same kubernetes cluster or you are using multiple clusters for your environments\n\nPreview Environments lets you propose code changes via Pull Requests and have a Preview Environment automatically created, running your code in kubernetes to get fast feedback from your team before agreeing to merge changes to the main branch\n\nChatOps comment on Pull Requests to give feedback, approve/hold changes, trigger optional pipelines for additional testing and other ChatOps commands\n\nAll of the above is implemented in reusable Tekton pipelines.\n\nReusing Jenkins X Pipelines\n\nSo how can we reuse automated CI/CD pipelines from Jenkins X project from Jenkins?\n\nMake sure you have the Tekton Client plugin for Jenkins installed in your Jenkins server.\n\nUsing a working template\n\nIf you want to start with a working example then\n\nCreate A Git Repository From This Template\n\nadd a new Frestyle project to your Jenkins server\n\nenable the Git source code management for your new github.com repository\n\nclick Add build Step (near the bottom of the page) and then select Tekton : Create Resource (Raw)\n\nmake sure that FILE is selected for the input and enter the name.lighthouse/jenkins-x/release.yaml for the file name\n\nif you are using a Jenkins X cluster enter jx for the namespace\n\nensure that Enable Tekton Catalog is checked\n\nnow save the pipeline - it should look something like this:\n\nNow if you trigger the pipeline you should see it create a Tekton Pipeline and you should see the output of the tekton pipeline in the Jenkins console. The pipeline is actually running as a completely separate Pod in kubernetes; the Jenkins controller just tails the log into the console.\n\nIn a Jenkins X cluster this pipeline should just work (reusing all the cloud resources and IAM roles setup by the Terraform) but in an arbitrary kubernetes cluster you may get issues around not being able to push images or promote due to lack of GitOps environments being defined which we can help you work through via the Jenkins X slack room\n\nUsing an existing repository\n\nYou can configure a Pull Request or Release pipeline in your project by copying the YAML file for the language pack you wish to use.\n\ne.g. if you are using maven then copy pullrequest.yaml or release.yaml into your projects source code then reference it from your Jenkins Job:\n\nThen follow the above instructions for setting up a Freestyle project for your git repository and referencing the file name for your pipeline.\n\nOverriding steps\n\nBeing able to reuse steps from libraries of pipelines is awesome; but sometimes you need to change things. The assumptions, commands, arguments, environment variables or approaches used for every step in a library may not quite match what you need on a specific application. You may need to run steps before/after steps in the library or you may need to override a specific step to do something different.\n\nYou can easily customize any inherited step in any shared pipeline or add custom steps before/after any step.\n\nThe fact that all the Tekton YAML is fully declarative makes it super easy to modify things via your IDE with validation and smart completion and not have to use a scripting language and understand complex shared pipeline libraries.\n\nThe easiest way to try overriding a step is to install the jx binary to your $PATH then use the jx pipeline override command which will create a new locally overridden step you can then just edit in your IDE.\n\nThen at any time you can view the effective pipeline when you make local changes\n\nComparing the Kubernetes and Tekton plugins\n\nThose of you using Jenkins on a Kubernetes cluster are probably using the kubernetes plugin right now.\n\nHere is an example of how to use a Jenkinsfile with a pod YAML file so that you can run commands in different containers in the pod.\n\nWhat this means is that:\n\na kubernetes pod is created based on the pod YAML file which is scheduled by kubernetes\n\nthe Jenkinsfile runs on the Jenkins controller talking over Jenkins remoting to the pod to tell it to run commands in different containers. The pod includes the jnlp container which does the remoting between the Jenkins controller and the pod\n\nThis has a few issues:\n\neach container in the pod must have a shell so that jnlp can invoke commands. This may mean you have to create your own images\n\nit can be a little slow to start since there is chattiness with the Jenkins controller and the pod - whereas with Tekton pods just start and run locally without any coodination with the Jenkins controller\n\nyou have to maintain 2 files: the Jenkinsfile and the pod.yaml and itâ€™s hard to share/override both of those files across multiple repositories as you need to make changes (e.g. overriding environment variables/images/commands/resource limits on demand on steps).\n\nThough one downside of the tekton approach is that by default there is no automatic synchronisation of state; after a Task in tekton completes thereâ€™s no automatic upload of state to the Jenkins controllers disk. You can always add a step in your Task to upload workspace state to the Jenkins controller if thatâ€™s what you want.\n\nThough remember that tekton plugin doesnâ€™t take anything away; so you can mix and match the kubernetes and tekton plugins to suit your needs.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe are really excited about the combination of Jenkins, Tekton and Jenkins X letting developers pick the best tool for the job while becoming more cloud native and increasing the automation help reduce the amount of manual work creating and maintaining pipelines while also helping to improve the quality and practices of our CI/CD.\n\nPlease try it out and let us know how you get on!","title":"Easily reuse Tekton and Jenkins X from Jenkins","tags":["jenkins-x","kubernetes","pipeline","tekton","gitops","interoperability"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/19e71/jstrachan.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/77b35/jstrachan.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/d4a57/jstrachan.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/19e71/jstrachan.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/68974/jstrachan.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/ef6ff/jstrachan.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/8257c/jstrachan.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/6766a/jstrachan.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/70241374c0e6a5665fafbc121c330d3c/22bfc/jstrachan.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"jstrachan","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>James is a long time open source contributor, created the Groovy programming language and Apache Camel integration framework.\nFor the past few years he&#8217;s been working on CI/CD with Kubernetes.</p>\n</div>","id":"jstrachan","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"James Strachan","slug":"/blog/author/jstrachan","twitter":"jstrachan"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a9230039-d1c0-5968-b24d-fc0746acc97a","slug":"/blog/2021/04/15/jenkins-operator-sub-project/","strippedHtml":"We are happy to announce that Jenkins Operator officially became an official Jenkins sub-project.\n\nWhat does it mean for the project?\n\nBecoming an official part of the Jenkins project was a major step towards better alignment with the overall Jenkinsâ€™ roadmap and more opportunities to increase adoption of the Jenkins Operator project.\n\nFinally, with a dedicated team at VirtusLab actively maintaining the project we can engage with the wider community and participate in some of the Cloud-Native SIG meetings.\nThis opens a room for everyone to voice their opinions or start supporting the project.\n\nWe truly believe that this community engagement will result in significant improvements to Jenkins Operator, as well as the Jenkins ecosystem itself.\n\nBridging the gap between Jenkins and Kubernetes\n\nRunning Jenkins in a cloud-native environment like Kubernetes is not a trivial task.\nWith Jenkins Operator project we want to enable the community to take full advantage of Kubernetes and public cloud capabilities by:\n\nnative integration with public cloud services in areas of observability, storage and cloud security\n\nKubernetes autoscaling and self-healing mechanism\n\nsecure access to Jenkins instance\n\ndeclarative configuration using Kubernetes Custom Resources\n\nfull lifecycle management, eventually transforming it to autopilot\n\nTake part in the journey toward global trends\n\nStart contributing and play an important role in creating the automated Jenkins experience!

is the worldâ€™s leading open-source automation server used by companies large and small around the globe to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery.\nKubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.\nKubernetes is compatible with the majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests, deploy builds in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.\nOne of the most popular CI/CD tools now is Jenkins thereby making Jenkins on Kubernetes a popular theme for Jenkins users.\n\nDuring the Google Season Of Docs program, I worked with the Jenkins organization on the project - Document Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nThe original proposal for this project can be found here.\n\nProject Goals\n\nAfter my proposal was accepted by the Jenkins organization, my mentors and I agreed on the expectations for the Google Season of Docs project.\nThe goal of this project was to create a new Kubernetes Volume which would describe the concepts, techniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins thereby providing the following advantages:\n\nImprove the user experience of Jenkins on Kubernetes users by giving them a one-stop-shop for information on Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nMake it easy to track, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nReference the existing community documentation for Jenkins on K8s (plugins and tools/integrations).\n\nHow to guides, tutorials and explanations of concepts and techniques in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nJust-In-Time documentation which means that rather than documenting every feature comprehensively, we produce and release documentation in bits but continuously based on popular questions, feedback and area of interests gathered from the community and users.\n\nCommunity Bonding: Planning the solution\n\nFind below an outline of my activities during the community bonding phase:\n\nSetting up communication channels: meetings, mailings, chats: My mentors and I agreed on the right time and channel for communication due to time difference.\nWe agreed to meet twice weekly, on Mondays and Thursdays at 7:00 PM GMT +1 and use Jenkins documentation gitter channel for other communications.\n\nContacting Stakeholders and onboarding contributors: The project was  announced on social media and different Jenkins channels.\nI wrote a blog post to announce the project and created a project page on Jenkins.io.\n\nKnowledge transfer: I and my mentors planned knowledge sharing sessions and fixed tentative dates based on the availability of the trainers.\nMy mentors also shared useful resources to help me prepare for the project.\n\nGetting permissions: I and my mentors agreed I didnâ€™t need any special permissions from the beginning, however, this topic was left open for discussion if the need arose later on in the project.\n\nPre-planning of the project: I refined my goals and set expectations with my mentor and also learned more about the community(Jenkins).\nI also had to ensure that the proposed documentation structure I drafted was in line with the goals of the organization so my mentors vetted it and we finalized on the proposed sections that I was supposed to work on.\n\nDocumentation Development Phase\n\nKnowledge Sharing Sessions\n\nDuring the development phase, my mentors hosted two knowledge sharing sessions:\n\nKatacoda and Helm by Marky Jackson\n\nSee the slides\n\nHelm by Torsten Walter\n\nSee the slides\n\nThese sessions gave me an in-depth understanding of concepts and tools needed for the project.\n\nJenkins on Kubernetes Documentation Skeleton\n\nAt the application phase, I drafted a structure describing the proposed Jenkins on Kubernetes section.\nMy intention was to use it as a guide during the implementation phase of the project, but when the development phase kicked off, my mentors and I thought of a better approach to creating a new Jenkins on Kubernetes section which was to add the Jenkins on Kubernetes contents to existing related sections for easier navigation and better user experience.\nAn example of this approach would be creating the Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes section under the Installing Jenkins section rather than putting it under an entirely new section.\nWith this new approach, I was assigned a task to create a skeleton with all the proposed Jenkins on Kubernetes sections on Jenkins.io and mark these sections as\nWork In Progress (WIP).\nThe Plan was to use this skeleton as a guide throughout the GSOD Project.\nThe Jenkins on Kubernetes skeleton PR can be found here.\n\nDocumenting Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nWhile working on this project, I had to do a lot of research and test all the documented steps locally before pushing the documentation out for review.\nI also made sure to use updated terms and terminologies where necessary like Controller instead of Master and Agents instead of Slave.\n\nDuring the documentation phase, I was able to work on documenting Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes with three sections Helm, Set of Yaml files and Jenkins Operator.\nI also worked on creating a directory for Jenkins on kubernetes sample files in Jenkins.io repository, documenting Scaling Jenkins on Kubernetes and Jenkins on AWS which is still in progress.\n\nWork Done\n\nPull Requests : All the pull requests I submitted to Jenkins.io documentation can be found here.\nThis spreadsheet contains links to the published documentation on Jenkins.io.\nThe spreadsheet also highlights the initial proposed tasks and the status of each of them.\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes documentation, you can check out pending tasks here and reach out in the Jenkins documentation gitter channel.\n\nChallenges\n\nUsing a Windows computer was a bit of a challenge for me.\nTo run Jenkins.io locally, the project uses GNU/Make and Docker in order to generate the fully statically generated jenkins.io web site.\nThe key tool for converting source code into the site is the Awestruct static site generator, which is downloaded automatically as part of the build process.\nTo achieve this, I needed to have GNU/Make and Docker available on my machine.\nDocker was not a problem, but to achieve the latter, I needed to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\nWSL had two versions WSL1 and WSL2. Using WSL2 would have been much more convenient, but my version of windows wasnâ€™t compatible with WSL2 as it required Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher for x64 systems.\nWith this obstacle, I had to stick to making WSL1 work but I still couldnâ€™t get this to work, a series of issues came up which I was able to pass through with the help of my mentors until I got stuck at permission issues.\nI raised the issue with my mentor and after looking through the issue with me and trying to solve it to no avail, he suggested setting up an Ubuntu VM in Hyper-V.\nThis article helped me achieve this and that solved my problem.\n\nWhat did I learn?\n\nI learned a lot more about the Jenkins project, Kubernetes, helm package manager, Jenkins Operator and much more.\nThis project also gave me the opportunity to work with cloud providers like AWS which was totally new to me and also learn from field experts through knowledge sharing sessions and weekly meetings with my mentors and org admin.\nMy technical writing skill and communication skill have definitely become better and I owe it to this project.\n\nOverall, contributing to the Jenkins.io project is an amazing experience for me.\nI have been using Jenkins, and the fact that I was able to contribute to the organization and collaborate with the community is an honor.","title":"GSOD Project Report: Document Jenkins on Kubernetes","tags":["kubernetes","helm","documentation","gsod","gsod2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"zaycodes","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Zainab is a software developer and technical writer who is passionate about contributing to open source, improving technical documentation and advocating for gender diversity in open source collaboration.

I started contributing to Jenkins documentation during the technical writer\nexploration phase for Google Season of Docs 2020 and I must say, my journey so far\nhas been nothing short of amazing majorly because of the supportive community behind this project.\nI chose the Jenkins project because I understood this project from a user point of view as I had been exposed to setting up, configuring,\nand using Jenkins to automate CI/CD processes. I piqued interest in two of Jenkins project ideas,\nPlugin documentation migration and update and Document Jenkins on Kubernetes, submitted proposals for these two projects and to my utmost joy, the latter was selected.\n\nIn this article, Iâ€™m going to be explaining what my selected project is about and why this project is important to the Jenkins community and its users.\n\nIntroduction\n\nKubernetes is a platform-agnostic container orchestration tool created by Google and heavily supported\nby the open-source community as a project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.\nIt allows you to use container instances and manage them for scaling and fault tolerance.\nIt also handles a wide range of management activities that would otherwise require separate solutions or custom code,\nincluding request routing, container discovery, health checks, and rolling updates.\n\nKubernetes is compatible with the majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests,\ndeploy builds in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.\nOne of the most popular CI/CD tools now is Jenkins for the following reasons:\n\nIt is open-source and free.\n\nit is user-friendly, easy to install and does not require additional installations or components.\n\nJenkins is also quite easy to configure, modify and extend.\n\nIt deploys code and generates test reports.\n\nIt also boasts a rich plugin ecosystem. The extensive pool of plugins makes Jenkins flexible and allows building, deploying and automating across various platforms.\n\nJenkins can be configured according to the requirements for continuous integrations and continuous delivery.\n\nJenkins is available for all platforms and different operating systems, whether it is OS X, Windows or Linux.\n\nMost of the integration work is automated. Hence fewer integration issues. This saves both time and money over the lifespan of a project.\n\nThe following reasons have made Jenkins on Kubernetes a popular theme for Jenkins users, however,\nthereâ€™s currently no central location for documentation describing Jenkins on Kubernetes,\nthereby making it difficult for Jenkins on Kubernetes users to navigate and find information.\nThis project would create a new Kubernetes Volume on Jenkins.io which would describe the concepts,\ntechniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins.\n\nCurrent State\n\nThere are a lot of presentations and articles about running Jenkins on Kubernetes, however,\nthereâ€™s no central location for describing Jenkins on Kubernetes. This makes it difficult for:\n\nJenkins on Kubernetes users to navigate and find information\n\nTrack, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nProject Improvements\n\nTo solve the existing issue with Jenkins on Kubernetes documentation,\na new Kubernetes volume will be created on Jenkins.io.\nThis Volume is going to aggregate user guides, information on cloud providers and demos on Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nYou can find the proposed contents for the new volume here.\nFeel free to comment on any suggestions you might have in the proposed content doc.\n\nThis project will also provide the following advantages:\n\nImprove the user experience of Jenkins on Kubernetes users by giving them a one-stop-shop for information on Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nMake it easy to track, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes using the Solutions page\n\nReference the existing community documentation for Jenkins on K8s (plugins and tools/integrations).\n\nHow to guides, tutorials and explanations of concepts and techniques in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nJust-In-Time documentation which means that rather than documenting every feature comprehensively,\nwe will produce and release documentation in bits but continuously based on popular questions,\nfeedback and area of interests gathered from the community and users.\n\nProject Timeline\n\nFind below a summary of the project timeline.\n\nCommunity bonding ( August 17 - September 13 )\n\nSet up a communication channel and time (due to time difference).\n\nRefine my goals and set expectations on both sides.\n\nLearn more about the community and Jenkins.\n\nGather and thoroughly study existing resources that will be useful and helpful to the project.\n\nPre-planning of the project\n\nContacting Stakeholders and onboarding contributors\n\nDocumentation Period\n\nThis period is going to be focused on creating contents which include user guides,\ntutorials, demos, etc. for Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nSome of the topics to be covered include Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes,\nAdministering Jenkins on Kubernetes, Cloud providers and much more.\n\nDocumentation Timeline\n\n1st Month (September - October)\n\nSome basic prerequisites for installing jenkins on kubernetes include docker, a kubernetes cluster, and optionally Helm or the Jenkins Operator for Kubernetes.\n\nHelm is a package manager which automates the process of installing, configuring, upgrading, and removing complex Kubernetes application. A Helm chart defines several Kubernetes resources as a set. Helm can make deployments easier and repeatable because all resources for an application are deployed by running one command.\n\nHelm has two elements, a client (helm) and a server (Tiller). The server element runs inside a Kubernetes cluster and manages the installation of charts. With Helm, configuration settings are kept in values.yaml file separate from the manifest formats. The configuration values can be changed according to application need without touching the rest of the manifest.\n\nOn the other hand, the Jenkins operator is a Kubernetes native operator which fully manages Jenkins on Kubernetes. It is easy to install with just a few manifests and allows users to configure and manage Jenkins on Kubernetes. To run jenkins-operator, you need to have a running Kubernetes cluster and kubectl installed.\n\nThe Jenkins Operator provides out of the box:\n\nIntegration with Kubernetes â€” preconfigured kubernetes-plugin for provisioning dynamic Jenkins Slaves as Pods\n\nPipelines as Code â€” declarative way to version your pipelines in VCS\n\nExtensibility via Groovy scripts or Configuration as Code plugin-customize your Jenkins, configure OAuth authorization and more\n\nSecurity and Hardening â€” an initial security hardening of Jenkins instance via Groovy scripts to prevent security vulnerabilities\n\nIn the first month, the focus will be on documenting an introductory section.\nThis section will include but is not limited to Setting up Kubernetes cluster, Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes, exploring the various approaches by which this can be achieved such as using helm package manager or the Jenkins Operator as explained above and Administering Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\n2nd Month (October - November)\n\nIn the second month, the focus will be on documenting how to setup up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Kubernetes on different cloud providers.\nSome of the cloud providers we will be looking at include but are not limited to:\n\nAmazon Web Service (AWS)\n\nAzure Kubernetes Service\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\n3rd Month (November - December)\n\nIn the final month, the focus will be on creating demos and tutorials,\nsubmitting project report, evaluation of mentors and finally,\npublishing a report of my experience as a participant in Season of Docs.\n\nConclusion\n\nJenkins community is actively working towards improving its documentation to create a better\nexperience for Jenkins users and invites technical writers to join the community and contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes project.\n\nTo contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes project, simply join the Jenkins documentation Gitter channel and drop a message,\nyou can also find the Google season of docs office hour notes and recordings for Jenkins on Kubernetes here.\nGSOD office hours take place twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays between 6pm GMT+1 and 7pm GMT+1,\nif you would like to be part of these meetings, you can indicate interest in the Jenkins Documentation\nGitter channel and we would be happy to have you.\n\nIf you are also a newcomer and would like to contribute to Jenkins, documentation is a great place to contribute.\nA lot of small patches can be done from the GitHub web interface even without cloning repositories locally.\nYou can find some good first issues to get started with here.\n\nFind more information on contributing to Jenkins documentation here.\nIf you have further questions about the Jenkins on Kubernetes project or contributing to Jenkins,\nyou can reach out on the Jenkins documentation Gitter channel.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nGSoD Proposal\n\nGSoD Office Hours Notes\n\nGoogle Season of Docs - Startup\n\nGoogle Season of Docs on jenkins.io\n\nDocs SIG for Google Season of Docs startup ( video)","title":"Documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes Introduction","tags":["kubernetes","documentation","gsod","gsod2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"zaycodes","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Zainab is a software developer and technical writer who is passionate about contributing to open source, improving technical documentation and advocating for gender diversity in open source collaboration.

My project for Google Summer of Code 2019 is Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features. After a successful Phase 1, finally the 2.0 version of the plugin has been released. The 2.0 version provides seamless integration with Kubernetes environment.\n\n2.0 version features\n\nStart a simple Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes.\n\nDynamically provision Remoting Kafka Agent in Kubernetes.\n\nHelm chart to bootstrap the whole system in Kubernetes.\n\nStart a simple Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes\n\nUse of the plugin requires that users have a configured Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka server, which could be intimidating for people who just want to try out the plugin. Now, users can start a simple, single-node Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes environment with just one button click.\n\nOn the Global Configuration page, users can input Kubernetes server information and credentials. When users click Start Kafka on Kubernetes button, Jenkins will create a Kubernetes client from the information and then apply Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka YAML specification files from resources. After downloading images and creating containers, it will automatically update Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka URLs into respective fields.\n\nDynamically provision Remoting Kafka Agent in Kubernetes\n\nWith previous version, users have to manually add/remove nodes so it is hard to scale builds quickly. Kubernetes plugin allows us to dynamically provision agents in Kubernetes but it is designed for JNLP agent. With this new version, Remoting Kafka agent can also be provisioned automatically in Kubernetes environment.\n\nUsers can find the new feature in Cloud section in /configure. Here users could input Kubernetes connection parameters and desired Remoting Kafka agent properties including labels. When new build with matching labels gets started and there are no free nodes, Cloud will automatically provision Remoting Kafka agent pod in Kubernetes to run the build.\n\nHelm Chart\n\nHelm chart for Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin is based on stable/jenkins chart and incubator/kafka chart. You can follow the instruction here to install a demo ready-to-use Helm release.

My project for Google Summer of Code 2019 is Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features. This is the first time I have contributed for Jenkins and I am very excited to announce the features that have been done in Phase 1.\n\nProject Introduction\n\nCurrent version of Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin requires users to manually configure the entire system which includes Zookeeper, Kafka and remoting agents. It also doesnâ€™t support dynamic agent provisioning so scalability is harder to achieve. My project aims to solve two problems:\n\nOut-of-the-box solution to provision Apache Kafka cluster.\n\nDynamic agent provisioning in a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nCurrent State\n\nKubernetes connector with credentials supported.\n\nApache Kafka provisioning in Kubernetes feature is fully implemented.\n\nHelm chart is partially implemented.\n\nApache Kafka provisioning in Kubernetes\n\nThis feature is part of 2.0 version so it is not yet released officially. You can try out the feature by using the Experimental Update Center to update to 2.0.0-alpha version or building directly from master branch:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting-kafka-plugin.git\ncd remoting-kafka-plugin/plugin\nmvn hpi:run\n\nOn the Global Configuration page, users can input Kubernetes server information and credentials. Then they can start Apache Kafka with only one button click.\n\nWhen users click Start Kafka on Kubernetes button, Jenkins will create a Kubernetes client from the information and then apply Zookeeper and Kafka YAML specification files from resources.\n\nHelm Chart\n\nHelm chart for Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin is based on stable/jenkins chart and incubator/kafka chart. As of now, the chart is still a Work in Progress because it is still waiting for Cloud API implementation in Phase 2. However, you can check out the demo chart with a single standalone Remoting Kafka Agent:\n\ngit clone -b demo-helm-phase-1 https://github.com/longngn/remoting-kafka-plugin.git\ncd remoting-kafka-plugin\nK8S_NODE=./helm/jenkins-remoting-kafka/do.sh start\n\nThe command do.sh start will do the following steps:\n\nInstall the chart (with Jenkins and Kafka).\n\nLaunch a Kafka computer on Jenkins controller by applying the following JCasC.\n\njenkins:\n  nodes:\n    - permanent:\n        name: \"test\"\n        remoteFS: \"/home/jenkins\"\n        launcher:\n          kafka: {}\n\nLaunch a single Remoting Kafka Agent pod.\n\nYou can check the chart state by running kubectl, for example:\n\n$ kubectl get all -n demo-helm\nNAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/demo-jenkins-998bcdfd4-tjmjs        2/2     Running   0          6m30s\npod/demo-jenkins-remoting-kafka-agent   1/1     Running   0          4m10s\npod/demo-kafka-0                        1/1     Running   0          6m30s\npod/demo-zookeeper-0                    1/1     Running   0          6m30s\n\nNAME                              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE\nservice/demo-0-external           NodePort    10.106.254.187 19092:31090/TCP              6m30s\nservice/demo-jenkins              NodePort    10.101.84.33 8080:31465/TCP               6m31s\nservice/demo-jenkins-agent        ClusterIP   10.97.169.65 50000/TCP                    6m31s\nservice/demo-kafka                ClusterIP   10.106.248.10 9092/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-kafka-headless       ClusterIP   None 9092/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-zookeeper            ClusterIP   10.109.222.63 2181/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-zookeeper-headless   ClusterIP   None 2181/TCP,3888/TCP,2888/TCP   6m31s\n\nNAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/demo-jenkins   1/1     1            1           6m30s\n\nNAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\nreplicaset.apps/demo-jenkins-998bcdfd4   1         1         1       6m30s\n\nNAME                              READY   AGE\nstatefulset.apps/demo-kafka       1/1     6m30s\nstatefulset.apps/demo-zookeeper   1/1     6m30s\n\nNext Phase Plan\n\nImplement Cloud API to provision Remoting Kafka Agent.
