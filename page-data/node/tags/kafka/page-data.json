My project for Google Summer of Code 2019 is Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features. After a successful Phase 1, finally the 2.0 version of the plugin has been released. The 2.0 version provides seamless integration with Kubernetes environment.\n\n2.0 version features\n\nStart a simple Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes.\n\nDynamically provision Remoting Kafka Agent in Kubernetes.\n\nHelm chart to bootstrap the whole system in Kubernetes.\n\nStart a simple Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes\n\nUse of the plugin requires that users have a configured Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka server, which could be intimidating for people who just want to try out the plugin. Now, users can start a simple, single-node Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes environment with just one button click.\n\nOn the Global Configuration page, users can input Kubernetes server information and credentials. When users click Start Kafka on Kubernetes button, Jenkins will create a Kubernetes client from the information and then apply Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka YAML specification files from resources. After downloading images and creating containers, it will automatically update Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka URLs into respective fields.\n\nDynamically provision Remoting Kafka Agent in Kubernetes\n\nWith previous version, users have to manually add/remove nodes so it is hard to scale builds quickly. Kubernetes plugin allows us to dynamically provision agents in Kubernetes but it is designed for JNLP agent. With this new version, Remoting Kafka agent can also be provisioned automatically in Kubernetes environment.\n\nUsers can find the new feature in Cloud section in /configure. Here users could input Kubernetes connection parameters and desired Remoting Kafka agent properties including labels. When new build with matching labels gets started and there are no free nodes, Cloud will automatically provision Remoting Kafka agent pod in Kubernetes to run the build.\n\nHelm Chart\n\nHelm chart for Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin is based on stable/jenkins chart and incubator/kafka chart. You can follow the instruction here to install a demo ready-to-use Helm release. Your kubectl get all should look like this:\n\nNAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/demo-jenkins-64dbd87987-bmndf   1/1     Running   0          2m21s\npod/demo-kafka-0                    1/1     Running   0          2m21s\npod/demo-zookeeper-0                1/1     Running   0          2m21s\n\nNAME                              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE\nservice/demo-jenkins              NodePort    10.108.238.56 8080:30386/TCP               2m21s\nservice/demo-jenkins-agent        ClusterIP   10.98.85.184 50000/TCP                    2m21s\nservice/demo-kafka                ClusterIP   10.109.231.58 9092/TCP                     2m21s\nservice/demo-kafka-headless       ClusterIP   None 9092/TCP                     2m21s\nservice/demo-zookeeper            ClusterIP   10.103.2.231 2181/TCP                     2m21s\nservice/demo-zookeeper-headless   ClusterIP   None 2181/TCP,3888/TCP,2888/TCP   2m21s\n\nNAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/demo-jenkins   1/1     1            1           2m21s\n\nNAME                                      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\nreplicaset.apps/demo-jenkins-64dbd87987   1         1         1       2m21s\n\nNAME                              READY   AGE\nstatefulset.apps/demo-kafka       1/1     2m21s\nstatefulset.apps/demo-zookeeper   1/1     2m21s\n\nHow to Contribute\n\nYou are welcome to try out the plugin and integrate it into your current setup.

My project for Google Summer of Code 2019 is Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features. This is the first time I have contributed for Jenkins and I am very excited to announce the features that have been done in Phase 1.\n\nProject Introduction\n\nCurrent version of Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin requires users to manually configure the entire system which includes Zookeeper, Kafka and remoting agents. It also doesnâ€™t support dynamic agent provisioning so scalability is harder to achieve. My project aims to solve two problems:\n\nOut-of-the-box solution to provision Apache Kafka cluster.\n\nDynamic agent provisioning in a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nCurrent State\n\nKubernetes connector with credentials supported.\n\nApache Kafka provisioning in Kubernetes feature is fully implemented.\n\nHelm chart is partially implemented.\n\nApache Kafka provisioning in Kubernetes\n\nThis feature is part of 2.0 version so it is not yet released officially. You can try out the feature by using the Experimental Update Center to update to 2.0.0-alpha version or building directly from master branch:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting-kafka-plugin.git\ncd remoting-kafka-plugin/plugin\nmvn hpi:run\n\nOn the Global Configuration page, users can input Kubernetes server information and credentials. Then they can start Apache Kafka with only one button click.\n\nWhen users click Start Kafka on Kubernetes button, Jenkins will create a Kubernetes client from the information and then apply Zookeeper and Kafka YAML specification files from resources.\n\nHelm Chart\n\nHelm chart for Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin is based on stable/jenkins chart and incubator/kafka chart. As of now, the chart is still a Work in Progress because it is still waiting for Cloud API implementation in Phase 2. However, you can check out the demo chart with a single standalone Remoting Kafka Agent:\n\ngit clone -b demo-helm-phase-1 https://github.com/longngn/remoting-kafka-plugin.git\ncd remoting-kafka-plugin\nK8S_NODE=./helm/jenkins-remoting-kafka/do.sh start\n\nThe command do.sh start will do the following steps:\n\nInstall the chart (with Jenkins and Kafka).\n\nLaunch a Kafka computer on Jenkins controller by applying the following JCasC.\n\njenkins:\n  nodes:\n    - permanent:\n        name: \"test\"\n        remoteFS: \"/home/jenkins\"\n        launcher:\n          kafka: {}\n\nLaunch a single Remoting Kafka Agent pod.\n\nYou can check the chart state by running kubectl, for example:\n\n$ kubectl get all -n demo-helm\nNAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/demo-jenkins-998bcdfd4-tjmjs        2/2     Running   0          6m30s\npod/demo-jenkins-remoting-kafka-agent   1/1     Running   0          4m10s\npod/demo-kafka-0                        1/1     Running   0          6m30s\npod/demo-zookeeper-0                    1/1     Running   0          6m30s\n\nNAME                              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE\nservice/demo-0-external           NodePort    10.106.254.187 19092:31090/TCP              6m30s\nservice/demo-jenkins              NodePort    10.101.84.33 8080:31465/TCP               6m31s\nservice/demo-jenkins-agent        ClusterIP   10.97.169.65 50000/TCP                    6m31s\nservice/demo-kafka                ClusterIP   10.106.248.10 9092/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-kafka-headless       ClusterIP   None 9092/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-zookeeper            ClusterIP   10.109.222.63 2181/TCP                     6m30s\nservice/demo-zookeeper-headless   ClusterIP   None 2181/TCP,3888/TCP,2888/TCP   6m31s\n\nNAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/demo-jenkins   1/1     1            1           6m30s\n\nNAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE\nreplicaset.apps/demo-jenkins-998bcdfd4   1         1         1       6m30s\n\nNAME                              READY   AGE\nstatefulset.apps/demo-kafka       1/1     6m30s\nstatefulset.apps/demo-zookeeper   1/1     6m30s\n\nNext Phase Plan\n\nImplement Cloud API to provision Remoting Kafka Agent.

You can check the CHANGELOG to see the features included in this release.\n\nAbout me\n\nMy name is Pham Vu Tuan, I am a final year undergraduate student from Singapore. This is the first time I participate in Google Summer of Code and contribute to an open-source organization.\n\nMentors\n\nI have GSoC mentors who help me in this project Oleg Nenashev and Supun Wanniarachchi. Besides that, I also receive great support from developers in remoting project Devin Nusbaum and Jeff Thompson.\n\nOverview\n\nCurrent versions of Jenkins Remoting are based on the TCP protocol. If it fails, the agent connection and the build fails as well. There are also issues with traffic prioritization and multi-agent communications, which impact Jenkins stability and scalability.\n\nThis project aims to develop a plugin in order to add support of a popular message queue/bus technology (Kafka) as a fault-tolerant communication layer in Jenkins.\n\nBenefits to the community\n\nProvide a new method to connect agent to controller using Kafka besides existing methods such as JNLP or SSH Build Agents plugin.\n\nHelp to resolve the existing issues with the TCP protocol between controller and agent communication in Jenkins.\n\nHelp to resolve traffic prioritization and multi-agent communications issue in Jenkins.\n\nWhy Kafka?\n\nWhen planning for this project, we want to use traditional message queue system such as ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ. However, after some discussion, we decided to have a try with Kafka with more suitable features with this project:\n\nKafka itself is not a queue like ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ, it is a distributed, replicated commit log. This helps to remove message delivery complexity we have in traditional queue system.\n\nWe need to support data streaming as a requirement, and Kafka is good at this aspect, which RabbitMQ is lack of.\n\nKafka is said to have a better scalability and good support from the development community.\n\nArchitecture Overview\n\nThe project consists of multiple components:\n\nKafka Client Library - new command transport implementation, producer and consumer client logic.\n\nRemoting Kafka Plugin - plugin implementation with KafkaGlobalConfiguration, KafkaComputerLauncher and KafkaSecretManager.\n\nRemoting Kafka Agent - A custom JAR agent with remoting JAR packaged together with a custom Engine implementation to setup a communication channel with Kafka. The agent is also packaged as a Docker image in DockerHub.\n\nAll the components are packaged together with Docker Compose.\n\nThe below diagram is the overview of the current architecture:\n\nWith this design, controller is not communicating with agent using direct TCP communication anymore, all the communication commands are transfered with Kafka.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe project is now under the third coding phase and we have some features available in 1.0 release.\n\n1. Kafka Global Configuration with support of credentials plugin to store secrets.\n\n2. Launch agent with Kafka Launcher.\n\n3. Launch agent from CLI using agent JAR with secret provided to ensure security.\n\n4. Run jobs, pipeline using Kafka agent.\n\n5. Kafka communication between controller and agent.\n\nRemoting operations are being executed over Kafka. In the log you may see:\n\nCommand execution (SlaveInstallerFactoryImpl.isWindows())\n\nClassloading (Classloader.fetch())\n\nLog streaming (Pipe.chunk())\n\nHow to run demo\n\nWe have setup a ready-to-fly demo for this plugin. You can try to run a demo of the plugin by following this instruction.\nFeatures in the demo:\n\nDocker Compose starts preconfigured controller and agent instance, they connect automatically using Kafka launcher.\n\nKafka is secured and encrypted with SSL.\n\nThere few demo jobs in the instance so that a user can launch a job on the agent.\n\nKakfa Manager supported in localhost:9000 to support monitoring of Kafka cluster.\n\nPhase 2 Presentation Slides\n\nPhase 2 Presentation Video\n\nLinks\n\nGitHub Repository\n\nWiki\n\nPlugin Site\n\nProject Info\n\nIntroduction Blogpost\n\nPhase 1 Evaluation Slides\n\nPhase 2 Evaluation Slides\n\nPhase 1 Evaluation Video\n\nPhase 2 Evaluation Video","title":"Remoting Kafka Plugin 1.0: A new method to connect agents","tags":["plugins","gsoc","gsoc2018","remoting","kafka"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/19e71/pvtuan10.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/77b35/pvtuan10.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/d4a57/pvtuan10.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/19e71/pvtuan10.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/ef6ff/pvtuan10.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/8257c/pvtuan10.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/227c1aaf83f4dc4f3b44ed51b9e39c2b/6766a/pvtuan10.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"pvtuan10","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Pham Vu Tuan is a developer from Singapore.\nHe starts contributing to Jenkins from Google Summer of Code 2018 for <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2018/remoting-over-message-bus/\">Jenkins Remoting over Message Bus/Queue</a></p>\n</div>","id":"pvtuan10","irc":"pvtuan10","linkedin":null,"name":"Pham Vu Tuan","slug":"/blog/author/pvtuan10","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"kafka","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
