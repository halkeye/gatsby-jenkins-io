Over a hundred of you have already shared your innovations, and they just keep coming.  It comes as no surprise that many of the submitted stories are from IT consultants and software developers around the world building next-generation DevOps and CI/CD platforms to fuel the modernization of enterprise companies far and wide.\n\nThat’s why we’ve dedicated our latest eBook to focus on Jenkins users in the global Information Technology sector.  We shine the spotlight on these developers and engineers who have solved unique software development and DevOps challenges by turning to the leading open source automation server.  From powering large enterprises needing a better way to manage their inventory to innovative tech firms looking to advance technologies and healthcare initiatives during a pandemic, you’ll read about how teams everywhere solved their unique challenges — with the help of Jenkins.\n\nJenkins is the Way to…\n\nIn our short User Story Survey, we ask Jenkins users to fill in the blank: Jenkins is the way to …​…​\n\nWe’ve seen results-oriented submissions like \"Jenkins is the way to deliver our new releases on time!\" and \"Jenkins is the way to understand and simplify your software workflows.\"  Several submissions riffed off of something like \"Jenkins is the way to completely automate your CI/CD workflow.\"  Meanwhile, others have had a bit more fun and languished praise on Jenkins, stating, \"Jenkins is the way to help teams focus on what is really important, make our life easier\" and, even, \"Jenkins is the way to save the day.\"\n\nIn this new eBook, we focus on the challenges users in the community face, and what they’ve built using Jenkins to achieve their unique goals. For example, Build & Release Manager, Donald Morton, turned to Jenkins to establish a flexible, modern, and more efficient DevOps platform for Graylog, a leading log management platform serving the enterprise.\n\nWith a Jenkins assist, Mark Baumann, DevOps Engineer with ITK Engineering, created “ one CI to rule them all.” He told us that “Jenkins provides a common CI/CD platform for all different kinds of projects and technology domains.”\n\nWhen IBM Lead Software Engineer Alec Rieger sought to simplify the build and testing pipeline for the company’s software engineers and developers, he also turned to Jenkins.  For a company the size of IBM, which services enterprise clients worldwide, Rieger wanted to help his colleagues manage many nodes on a large scale. Now, according to his Jenkins Is The Way user story, IBM uses Jenkins pipelines for each of their builds and relies on the flexibility and countless plugin features to continually improve their processes.\n\nStronger, Smarter, Faster Software Innovation\n\nWhile we all fondly think of Jenkins as a modest butler who has empowered developers with the open-source tools they need to succeed — on JenkinsIsTheWay.io, we liken him to an unpretentious, yet powerful superhero.  And like any great superhero, he (or she!) is sure to save the day.\n\nFor our Jenkins users, that means results — significant, measurable results with a common theme.  Using Jenkins has enabled you — the user — to help the businesses you serve save money, spin up software faster, and automate processes.  In doing so, you’ve freed up developers and engineers from countless hours of mundane tasks.  Thanks to Jenkins, you’re empowering entire IT teams to innovate, focus on what they love to do and, ultimately, build great stuff.\n\nOf course, we devote much of our latest eBook to those victories.  Results like how RedHat’s releases are 5x faster thanks to Jenkins.  The fact that DevOps problem tickets were reduced by over 90% for Electronic Health Solutions.  And why the CTO at Cloudologia was psyched to share that — with a Jenkins at the helm — they were able to shorten onboarding for deployment & build release cycles from one week to a single day.\n\nShare Your User Story, Too!\n\nI am proud to share another common theme from the users who have submitted their story:  you turn to our community for collaboration, guidance, and advice.  A community of a million strong and growing, this eBook and JenkinsIsTheWay.io are other ways to provide you with the insight and lessons learned by developers and engineers, like you, to innovate and build next-generation technologies for companies of all sizes.\n\nWhen you’re ready to tell your story, we’re prepared to help you share it. Fill out our short questionnaire, and we’ll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt as a thank you once it’s published!\n\nLinks\n\nJenkins IsThe Way.

this article, I would like to share some highlights from the User Interface track of the\nJenkins UI/UX Hackfest we held on May 25..29.\nThis blog post has been slightly delayed by the infrastructure issues we had in the project,\nbut, as for improving the Jenkins UI, it is better late than never.\nKey highlights from the event:\n\nWe delivered a preview of Jenkins read-only configuration.\nDuring the hackfest we discovered and fixed many compatibility issues.\n\nWe created a new Dark Theme for Jenkins.\nWe also improved theming support in the core, and fixed compatibility in many plugins.\n\nWe contributed to the Jenkins UI accessibility, including UX testing and fixing the reported issues.\njira:JENKINS-62437[Configuration UI: Tables to divs migration] testing was the dominant story there.\n\nWe worked on a New Script Security approvals management UI\n\nWe had 54 contributors at the hackfest.\n22 of them have contributed to the user interface track as committers, testers and reviewers:\nTim Jacomb,\nUllrich Hafner,\nRaihaan Shouhell,\nSumit Sarin,\nDaniel Beck,\nRomén Rodríguez-Gil,\nwadeck Follonier,\nRunxia Ye,\nFélix Queiruga,\nAytunc Beken,\nPeter Jonsson,\nAntonio Muniz,\nKseniia Nenasheva,\nSladyn Nuner,\nAbhyudaya Sharma,\nOleg Nenashev,\nNimish Bongale,\nEsther Álvarez Feijoo,\nDenys Digtiar,\nSlavo,\nLiam Newman, and\nGavin Mogan.\nThanks to all contributors!\n\nSee the blog post below to know more about these and other user interface improvements.\n\nRead-only Jenkins Configuration\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nfeature preview announcement,\npresentation materials\n\nA read-only view of Jenkins configurations, jobs and agents is important to Jenkins Configuration-as-Code users.\nIt would allow them to access configuration and diagnostics information about their Jenkins instances while having no opportunity to occasionally change it.\nThis story is a part of the Jenkins roadmap,\nand it was featured as an area for contribution during the UI/UX hackfest.\n\nOn May 25th we have released a preview for Read-only Jenkins Configuration.\nRead the announcement by Tim Jacomb in this blogpost.\nDuring the hackfest we kept testing the change and fixing compatibility in the Jenkins plugins,\nincluding the Cloud Stats Plugin, Role Strategy Plugin, Simple Disk Usage Plugin and others.\n\nWe would appreciate feedback and testing from the Jenkins users!\nSee the blogpost for the guidelines.\n\nDark Theme\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nproject repository\n\nDark user interface themes are very popular among developers: in IDE, communication tools, etc.\nAnd there is an interest to have one for Jenkins.\nThere were a few of implementations before the hackfest, most notably camalot/jenkins-dark-stylish and a dark version of the Neo2 Theme.\nThese themes were difficult to maintain, and finally they were either removed or abandoned.\nWhat if Jenkins had an official theme?\n\nDuring the event a group of contributors focused on creating a new Dark Theme for Jenkins.\nThis effort included:\n\nPatches to the Jenkins core which simplified development and maintenance of UI themes.\nSupport for CSS variables was added, as well as PostCSS processing which helps to simplify browser compatibility.\n\nDark Theme itself.\n\nUI Testing and compatibility fixes in the core and multiple Jenkins plugins.\n\nDark theme demo with support for the development mode.\n\nYou can try out this theme starting from Jenkins 2.239.\nIt is available as a plugin from the Jenkins Update Center.\nAn example screenshot of the main page:\n\nIf you discover any Dark theme compatibility issues,\nplease report them here.\n\nJenkins Configuration UI Accessibility\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nproject page\n\nJenkins Web UI accessibility was one of the suggested topics at the event.\nWe would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.\nIt includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.\nIn general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.\nSome of the accessibility improvements we implemented during the event:\n\nAdded aria-labels to username & password input fields\n\nIndicate the language of the page in the footer (not merged yet)\n\nRemove page generation timestamp from the footer\n\nAt the UI/UX hackfest the major focus was on migrating configuration pages from tables to divs\n(jira:JENKINS-62437[]).\nIt will make them more user-friendly on narrow and especially mobile screens.\nThe change will also help users to navigate complex forms with multiple levels of nesting.\nOur progress:\n\nUser Experience testing.\nThanks to the contributors, we discovered several compatibility issues in plugins.\n\nBug fixes in several plugins\n\nA new Dockerized demo which allows to evaluate the change with a set of pre-configured plugins.\n\nHere is an example of a job configuration page using the new layout:\n\nWe will keep working on this change in the coming weeks,\nand we invite Jenkins users and Contributors to help us with testing the change!\nTesting guidelines are available in the jira:JENKINS-62437[] ticket.\n\nNew Script Security approvals management UI\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\npull request\n\nDuring the hackfest Wadeck Follonier redesigned the script approval interface in the Script Security Plugin.\nThe new UI allows viewing the list of approved scripts, shows the last access timestamp, and allows managing the approvals individually.\nBefore, it was not possible to do it from the Web interface.\nOnce the pull request is released,\nthe feature will become available to Jenkins users.\n\nOther UI improvements\n\nIn addition to the major improvements listed above,\nthere were also many smaller patches in the Jenkins core and various plugins.\nYou can find a full list of contributions to the user interface here,\nsome important improvements:\n\nImproved navigation in the Credentials plugin.\n\nSupport for wide screens in the Autograding plugin.\n\nUI Improvements in the Folder-based Authorization Strategy plugin.\n\nImproved Fingerprint listing in the Jenkins core\n\nContributing\n\nWe invite Jenkins users and contributors to join the effort and to improve the user interface together.\nThe Jenkins project gradually adopts modern frontend stacks (JavaScript, React, Gatsby, Vue.js, etc.) and design methodologies.\nFor example, see the presentation about beautifying the UI of Jenkins reporter plugins by Ullrich Hafner.\nIt is a great opportunity for frontend developers to join the project, share their experiences, experiment with new technologies, and improve the Jenkins user interface and user experience.\nJoin us!\n\nSee this page for more information about contributing to the Jenkins codebase.\nIf you want to know more, join us in the Jenkins User Experience SIG channels.\n\nReferences\n\nYou can find more information

is not glamorous, but it is goodness.\n\n— Thomas Otter\n\nJenkins technical documentation is an important part of our project as it is key to using Jenkins well.\nGood documentation guides users and encourages good implementation choices.\nIt is a crucial part of the user experience.\n\nIn the recent Jenkins UI/UX hackfest, documentation was a specific track to improve the Jenkins user experience.\nWe received many improvements from experienced Jenkins contributors and newcomers alike.\nContributors from all around the world submitted pull requests for documentation on installing, managing, administering, and operating Jenkins.\n\nDocumentation migration from Wiki\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki pages have collected 15 years of experience and wisdom for Jenkins users.\nHowever, that experience and wisdom is intermixed with inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated information.\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki migration project identified the 50 most accessed pages on the Jenkins wiki and created GitHub issues to track the migration of those pages to www.jenkins.io.\nThis was our first large scale experiment using GitHub issues for documentation.\nThe results have been overwhelmingly positive.\nHackfest contributors added new sections to many documentation chapters, including:\n\nUsing Jenkins\n\nPipeline\n\nManaging Jenkins\n\nSystem Administration\n\nThe Hackfest closed 19 of the wiki migration issues.\nWork is in progress on an additional 25 wiki migration issues.\nWe’ve made great progress and look forward to even better results in the future.\nNew contributors used the \"good first issue\" label very effectively.\nWe started the Hackfest with most of the 25 \"good first issues\" unassigned and completed the Hackfest with 14 closed and 10 others in progress.\nWe’ll provide more \"good first issues\" as we use the Jenkins Wiki migration to welcome new documentation contributors.\n\nMigrating plugin documentation\n\nPlugin documentation is also in transition.\nSince November 2019, plugins have been moving their documentation into the GitHub repository that hosts the plugin source code.\nThis\"documentation as code\" approach allows plugin maintainers to include documentation improvements in the same pull requests that implement new capabilities.\nIt assures that documentation changes are reviewed by the same maintainers who review and approve new capabilities.\n\nHackfest participants submitted pull requests to migrate plugin documentation to GitHub.\n10 plugin pull requests are in progress from the Hackfest.\n5 plugin pull requests from the Hackfest have been already merged and are awaiting the release of the plugin.\n\nChuck Norris uses documentation as code\n\nIn the spirit of fun and adventure, Oleg Nenashev migrated the \"Chuck Norris plugin\" to GitHub documentation as code in a live Hackfest presentation May 26, 2020.\nLinks to the recording, the plugin migration guide, and the export tool are available from\"Migrating plugins to documentation-as-code\".\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nJenkins works with other technologies to solve automation challenges in many different environments.\nWe describe those environments in our\"Solution Pages\".\nAs part of the Hackfest, we’ve started a series of improvements to the solution pages.\n\nThe Docker solutions page now includes updated videos and a better page layout for easier reading and better navigation.\nOther solution pages will receive similar improvements in the future.\n\nSystem properties\n\nThe global configuration of Jenkins can be modified at startup by defining Java properties.\nSystem properties can change system defaults and can provide compatibility \"escape hatches\" when a new default configuration might be incompatible with existing installations.\n\nDaniel Beck has improved the navigation and user experience of the system properties page as part of the Hackfest.\nIt is now much easier to read and to reference, with embeddable links available with a mouse-over to the right of every property and labels that categorize and classify each property.\n\nPlugin site improvements\n\nDuring the Hackfest, Gavin Mogan has continued his efforts to improve the Jenkins Plugins Site so that users can easily access plugin changelogs and reported issues.\nOnce this pull request is merged, it will greatly improve the experience of those Jenkins users who want to update plugins and look for documentation about what has changed in them and what are the possible issues they might experience.\n\nExample of the incoming UI for the Jira plugin:\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThere is still much to do in Jenkins documentation and we need your help to do it.\nThere are many ways to participate in the Jenkins project, including documentation.\nSee the contributing guidelines for detailed instructions.\nJoin the documentation chat for personalized help and encouragement.\n\nThe Jenkins project has been also accepted to Google Season of Docs this year.\nThis open-source mentorship program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nWe are looking for technical writers who are interested to contribute to the project in September-December 2020.\nIt is a great opportunity to study Documentation-as-code tools and to learn more about contributing to open-source projects.\nYou can find Jenkins project ideas and more information here.","title":"Jenkins User Experience Hackfest Documentation

of the things we loved about going to developer conferences was meeting Jenkins users — newbies and old-timers alike — who are excited to talk about their projects and share tips on how to move forward using Jenkins.\nSince the coronavirus pandemic, we’re learning to rely more on new ways to gather, and it’s happening via Jenkins online meetups, GitHub collaborations, and Twitter threads, to name a few.\n\nIt’s a significant change.\nBut what hasn’t changed is the need to share stories about the things users have built, the solutions they’ve developed, and the excellent results they’re getting from some really innovative Jenkins implementations.\nThen we wondered, why isn’t anyone collecting these user stories and sharing them with the Jenkins community.\n\nIntroducing Jenkins is the Way\n\nSo we took the first step to record and archive all the great stuff everyone in our community is building with Jenkins.\nThis way, Jenkins users old and new can come to an archive and search for Jenkins solutions for inspiration.\nWe foresee a vast library of solutions from all around the world, solving a wide array of challenges in every industry imaginable.\nWe decided to call this archive \" Jenkins Is The Way\" and host it at https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io.\n\nTo aggregate all these stories, we built a simple online questionnaire so that Jenkins users can submit their own experience using this leading open source automation server.\nWith so many plugins to support building, deploying, and automating your projects, we expect to see a vast collection of stories.\n\nWe’ve already received a handful, including stories that illustrate how Jenkins Is The Way :\n\nto code your own release pipelines\n\nto cast magic of continuous delivery\n\nto understand and simplify your software lifecycle\n\nto accelerate automation in the cloud\n\nto facilitate day-to-day work\n\nAdd your story.
