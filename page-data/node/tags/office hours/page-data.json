It will be a developer-focused session where we’ll start off by talking a little about how UI development has traditionally been done in Jenkins, before moving on to some newer patterns and tools that we have been developing over the last few months that let us make use of a wider range of more modern client-side development tools. We’ll also dissect and run some sample plugins that show these newer client-side dev tools in action.\n\nAs usual, the session will start 11am PST. Links to watch and participate will be posted to the Office Hours wiki page before it starts.","title":"Office Hour: The State of JavaScript in Jenkins","tags":["office hours"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","id":"894f996c-0ca5-590a-b0ac-4202ec9b7db2","slug":"/blog/2015/10/19/upcoming-in-office-hours-fosdem-planning-session/","strippedHtml":"For the past several years we’ve been attending FOSDEM, a massive free and open source event in Brussels, Belgium.
