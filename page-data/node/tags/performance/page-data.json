If you’d like to skip the journey part, you can directly go to the [major performance improvements] section and the [minor performance section] to see what we’ve done!\n\nJourney to release\n\nThe project started with deciding to choose a git operation and then trying to compare the performance of that operation by using command line git and then with JGit.\n\nStage 1: Benchmark results with git fetch\n\nThe performance of git fetch (average execution time/op) is strongly correlated to the size of a repository\n\nThere exists an inflection point on the scale of repository size after which the nature of JGit performance changes (it starts to degrade)\n\nAfter running multiple benchmarks, it is safe to say that for a large sized repository command line git would be a better choice of implementation.\n\nWe can use this insight to implement a feature which avoids JGit with large repositories.\n\nStage 2: Comparing platforms\n\nThe project was also concerned that there might be important differences between operating systems.\nFor example, what if command line Git for Windows performed very differently than command line Git on Linux or FreeBSD?\nBenchmarks were run to compare fetch performance on several platforms.\n\nRunning git fetch operation for a 400 MiB sized repository on:\n\nAMD64 Microsoft Winders\n\nAMD64 FreeBSD\n\nIBM PowerPC 64 LE Ubuntu 18\n\nIBM System 390 Ubuntu 18\n\nThe result of running this experiment is given below:\n\nThe difference in performance between git and JGit remains constant across all platforms.\n\nBenchmark results on one platform are applicable to all platforms.\n\nStage 3: Performance of git fetch and repository structure\n\nThe area of the circle enclosing each parameter signifies the strength of the positive correlation between the performance of a git fetch operation and that parameter. From the diagram:\n\nSize of the aggregated objects is the dominant player in determining the execution time for a git fetch\n\nNumber of branches and Number of tags play a similar role but are strongly overshadowed by size of repository\n\nNumber of commits has a negligible effect on the performance of running git fetch\n\nAfter running these experiments from Stage-1 to Stage-3, we developed a solution called the GitToolChooser which is explained in the next stage\n\nStage 4: Faster checkout with Git tool chooser\n\nThis feature takes the responsibility of choosing the optimal implementation from the user and hands it to the plugin. It takes the decision of recommending an implementation on the basis of the size of the repository. Here is how it works.\n\nThe image above depicts the performance enhancements we have performed over the course of the GSoC project. These improvements have enabled the checkout step to be finished within half of what it used to take earlier in some cases.\n\nLet’s talk about performance improvements in two parts.\n\nMajor performance improvements\n\nBuilding Tensorflow (~800 MiB) using a Jenkins pipeline, there is over 50% reduction in overall time spent in completing a job!\nThe result is consistent multiple platforms.\n\nThe reason for such a decrease is the fact that JGit degrades in performance when we are talking about large sized repositories. Since the GitToolChooser is aware of this fact, it chooses to recommend command line git instead which saves the user some time.\n\nMinor performance improvements\n\nNote: Enable JGit before using the new performance features to let GitToolChooser work with more options → Here’s how\n\nBuilding the git plugin (~ 20 MiB) using a Jenkins pipeline, there is a drop of a second across all platforms when performance enhancement is enabled. Also, eliminating a redundant fetch reduces unnecessary load on git servers.\n\nThe reason for this change is the fact that JGit performs better than command line git for small sized repositories (<50MiB) as an already warmed up JVM favors the native Java implementation.\n\nReleases\n\nGit Plugin 4.4.0\n\nAdd GitToolChooser\n\nRemove redundant fetch\n\nGit Client Plugin 3.4.0\n\nAdd support to communicate compatibility of JGit with certain additional SCM behaviors\n\nThe road ahead\n\nSupport from other branch source plugins\n\nPlugins like the GitHub Branch Source Plugin or GitLab Branch Source Plugin need to extend an extension point provided by the git plugin to facilitate the exchange of information related to size of a remote repository hosted by the particular git provider\n\nJENKINS-63519 : GitToolChooser predicts the wrong implementation\n\nAddition of this feature to GitSCMSource\n\nDetection of lock related delays accessing the cache directories present on the controller\n\nThis issue was reported by the plugin maintainer Mark Waite, there is a need to reproduce the issue first and then find a possible solution.\n\nReaching out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions or feedback on the project’s\nGitter Channel or the\nJenkins Developer Mailing list.\nReport an issue at Jenkins Jira.\n\nUseful Links\n\nPhase 1 Blog: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/07/09/git-performance-improvement-phase1/\n\nPhase 2 Blog: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/07/29/git-performance-improvement-phase2/\n\nProject Page: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/git-plugin-performance/\n\nDemonstration","title":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement: Final Phase and Release","tags":["plugins","git","platform-sig","developer","performance","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#685848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/77b35/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/d4a57/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/68974/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/ef6ff/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/8257c/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/6766a/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/22bfc/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"rishabhBudhouliya","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2020 student under the Jenkins project (Git Plugin Performance Improvements).\nAspiring to be better at Software Development and participate more in the open source\ncommunity.</p>\n</div>","id":"rishabhbudhouliya","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rishabh Budhouliya","slug":"/blog/authors/rishabhbudhouliya","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","id":"84676949-9b05-55b1-b843-435c0ff0696d","slug":"/blog/2020/07/29/git-performance-improvement-phase2/","strippedHtml":"The second phase of the Git Plugin Performance Improvement project has been great in terms of the progress we have achieved in implementing performance improvement insights\nderived from the phase one JMH micro-benchmark experiments.\n\nWhat we’ve learned so far in this project is that a git fetch is highly correlated to the size of the remote repository. In order to make fetch improvements in this plugin, our task was to find the difference in performance for the two available git implementations in the Git Plugin, git and JGit.\n\nOur major finding was that git performs much better than JGit when it comes to a large sized repository (>100 MiB). Interestingly, JGit performs better than git when size of the repository is less than 100 MiB.\n\nIn this phase, we were successful in coding this derived knowledge from the benchmarks into a new functionality called the\nGitToolChooser.\n\nGitToolChooser\n\nThis class aims to add the functionality of recommending a git implementation on the basis of the size of a repository which has a strong correlation to the performance of git fetch (from performance Benchmarks).\n\nIt utilizes two heuristics to calculate the size:\n\nUsing cached .git dir from multibranch projects to estimate the size of a repository\n\nProviding an extension point which, upon implementation, can use REST APIs exposed by git service providers like Github, GitLab, etc to fetch the size of the remote repository.\n\nWill it optimize your Jenkins instance?\nThat requires one of the following:\n\nyou have a multibranch project in your Jenkins instance, the plugin can use that to recommend the optimal git implementation\n\nyou have a branch Source Plugin installed in the Jenkins instance, the particular branch source plugin will recommend a git implementation using REST APIs provided by GitHub or GitLab respectively.\n\nThe architecture and code for this class is at: PR-931\n\nNote : This functionality is an upcoming feature in the subsequent Git Plugin release.\n\nJMH benchmarks in multiple environments\n\nThe benchmarks were being executed on Linux and macOS machines frequently but there was a need to check if the results gained from those benchmarks would hold true across more platforms to ensure that the solution (GitToolChooser) is generally platform-agnostic.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we performed an experiment:\n\nRunning git fetch operation for a 400 MiB sized repository on:\n\nWindows\n\nFreeBSD 12\n\nppc64le\n\ns390x\n\nThe result of running this experiment is given below:\n\nObservations:\n\nppc64le and s390x are able to run the operation in almost half the time it takes for the Windows or FreeBSD 12 machine. This behavior may be attributed to the increased computational power of those machines.\n\nThe difference in performance between git and JGit remains constant across all platforms which is a positive sign for the GitToolChooser as its recommendation would be consistent across multiple devices and operating systems.\n\nRelease Plan 🚀\n\nJENKINS-49757 - Avoid double fetch from Git checkout step\nThis issue was fixed in phase one, avoids the second fetch in redundant cases.\nIt will be shipped with some benchmarks on the change in performance due to the removal of the second fetch.\n\nPR-574\n\nPR-904\n\nGitToolChooser\n\nPR-931\nThis pull request is under review, will be shipped in one of the subsequent Git Plugin releases.\n\nCurrent Challenges with GitToolChooser\n\nImplement the extension point to support GitHub Branch Source Plugin, Gitlab Branch Source Plugin and Gitea Plugin.\n\nThe current version of JGit doesn’t support LFS checkout and sparse checkout, need to make sure that the recommendation doesn’t break existing use cases.\n\nFuture Work\n\nIn phase three, we wish to:\n\nRelease a new version of the Git and Git Client Plugin with the features developed during the project\n\nContinue to explore more areas for performance improvement\n\nAdd a new git operation: git clone (Stretch Goal)\n\nReaching Out\n\nFeel free to reach out to us for any questions or feedback on the project’s Gitter Channel or the Jenkins\nDeveloper Mailing list.\n\nProject Page\n\nPhase 1 Blog Post","title":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement Phase-2 Progress","tags":["plugins","git","platform-sig","developer","performance","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#685848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/77b35/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/d4a57/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/19e71/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/68974/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/ef6ff/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/8257c/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/6766a/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/22bfc/rishabhbudhouliya.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/32fa8462b37abd3e057f4b70f0558972/rishabhbudhouliya.jpg"},"blog":null,"github":"rishabhBudhouliya","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2020 student under the Jenkins project (Git Plugin Performance Improvements).\nAspiring to be better at Software Development and participate more in the open source\ncommunity.</p>\n</div>","id":"rishabhbudhouliya","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Rishabh Budhouliya","slug":"/blog/authors/rishabhbudhouliya","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"615c1ac2-c3da-5001-be28-908ac6008d94","slug":"/blog/2020/07/09/git-performance-improvement-phase1/","strippedHtml":"Git Plugin Performance Improvement is a Google Summer of Code 2020 project.\nIt aims to improve the performance of the git plugin, which provides fundamental git functionalities.\n\nInternally, the plugin provides these functionalities using two implementations: command line git and JGit (pure java implementation).\n\nCLI git is the default implementation for the plugin, a user can switch to JGit if needed\n\nThe project is divided into two parallel stages:\n\nStage 1 : Create benchmarks which evaluate the execution time of a git operation provided by CLI git and JGit using JMH, a micro benchmarking test harness.\n\nStage 2 : Implement the insights gained from the analysis into the plugin to improve the overall performance of the plugin.\n\nThe project also aims to fix any existing performance bottlenecks within the plugin as well.\n\nBenchmarks\n\nThe benchmarks are written using JMH.

The performance issues for Role Strategy Plugin\nhad been reported multiple times on Jenkins JIRA. With a large number of roles\nand with complex regular expressions, a large slow-down was visible on the Web UI.\nEven before GSoC started, there were a number of patches which tried to improve\nperformance of the plugin (by Deepansh Nagaria\nand others).\n\nAt the time, there was no way to reliably measure improvements in performance.\nTherefore, we started by creating a\nframework\nfor running micro-benchmarks on Jenkins Plugins. Benchmarks using the framework\nwere added to the Role Strategy Plugin find performance\ncritical parts of the plugins and to measure the improvements of a change.\nThis blog post summarizes the changes that were made and performance improvements\nmeasured.\n\nCaching matching roles\n\nA couple of major changes were made to the Role Strategy Plugin to improve its\nperformance. First, we started collection of roles that matched a given\nproject name. The Role Strategy plugin before version 2.12 used to run over\nregular expressions for every role that it had for every permission checking\nrequest it got. Storing this produced set of roles in the memory provides us\nlarge improvements in performance and avoids repeated matching of project names\nwith regular expressions. For keeping the plugin working securely, we invalidate\nthe cache whenever any update is made to the roles.\n\nAfter this change, we were able to observe performance improvements of up to\n3300%. These improvements were visualized using\nJMH Visualizer.\n\nMore information is available at pull request on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/pull/81\n\nCalculating Implying Permisions when plugin is loaded\n\nJenkins' permission model allows one permissions to imply other permissions.\nWhen a permission check is made, we need to check if the user has any of\npermissions that would imply this permisison. For every permission checking\nrequest that that the Role Strategy, it used to calculate all the implying\npermissions.

At the same time, the plugin addresses one\nof the most popular ways of organizing projects in Jenkins, through folders.\nThe plugin also has a new UI with more improvements to come in the future.\n\nThe plugin supports three types of roles which are applicable at different places\nin Jenkins.\n\nGlobal Roles: applicable everywhere in Jenkins\n\nAgent Roles: restrict permissions for multiple agents connected to your instance\n\nFolder Roles: applicable to multiple jobs organized inside folders\n\nPerformance Improvements over Role Strategy Plugin\n\nThis plugin, unlike the Role Strategy plugin, does not use regular expressions\nfor finding matching projects and agents giving us performance improvements\nand makes administrators' lives easier. To reduce the number of roles required\nto be managed, permissions given to a folder through a folder role get inherited\nto all of its children. This is useful for giving access to multiple projects\nthrough a single role. Similarly, an agent role can be applied to multiple agents\nand assigned to multiple users.\n\nThis plugin is designed to outperform Role Strategy Plugin in permission\nchecks. The improvements were measured using the\nmicro-benchmark framework\nI had created during the first phase of my GSoC project.\nBenchmarks for identical configurations for both plugin show that the\npermissions check are up to 934x faster for 500 global roles when compared to\nthe global roles from the Role Strategy 2.13, which in itself contains several\nperformance improvements. Comparing folder roles with Role Strategy’s project\nroles, a permission check for access to a job almost 15x faster for 250 projects\norganized in two-level deep folders on an instance with 150 users. You can see\nthe benchmarks and the result comparisons\nhere.\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code Support\n\nThe plugin supports Jenkins Configuration-as-Code so you can configure permissions\nwithout going through the Web UI. A YAML configuration looks like this:\n\njenkins:\n  authorizationStrategy:\n    folderBased:\n      globalRoles:\n        - name: \"admin\"\n          permissions:\n            - id: \"hudson.model.Hudson.Administer\"\n              # ...\n          sids:\n            - \"admin\"\n        - name: \"read\"\n          permissions:\n            - id: \"hudson.model.Hudson.Read\"\n          sids:\n            - \"user1\"\n      folderRoles:\n        - folders:\n            - \"root\"\n          name: \"viewRoot\"\n          permissions:\n            - id: \"hudson.model.Item.Read\"\n          sids:\n            - \"user1\"\n      agentRoles:\n        - agents:\n            - \"agent1\"\n          name: \"agentRole1\"\n          permissions:\n            - id: \"hudson.model.Computer.Configure\"\n            - id: \"hudson.model.Computer.Disconnect\"\n          sids:\n            - \"user1\"\n\nREST APIs with Swagger support\n\nThe plugin provides REST APIs for managing roles with OpenAPI specifications\nthrough Swagger.json. You can check out the Swagger API on\nSwaggerHub.\nSwaggerHub provides stubs in multiple languages which can be downloaded and\nused to interact with the plugin. You can also see some sample requests from\nthe command line using curl.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nIn the (not-too-distant) future, I would like to work on improving the UI and\nmake the plugin easier to work with. I would also like to work on improving the\nAPIs, documentation and more optimizations for improving the plugin’s performance.\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nI would love to hear your comments and suggestions.

To make our job a bit easier,\nwe chose Java Microbenchmark Harness for running these benchmarks. This\nallows us to reliably measure performance of our time-critical functions and will help make Jenkins perform faster\nfor everyone.\n\nThe micro-benchmarking framework was recently released in the Jenkins Unit Test Harness 2.50.\nThe blog post below shows how to run benchmarks in your plugins.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe framework runs works by starting a temporary Jenkins instance for each fork of the JMH benchmark,\njust like JenkinsRule from Jenkins Test Harness. Benchmarks are run directly from your JUnit Tests which allows\nyou to fail builds on the fly and easily run benchmarks from your IDE, just like unit tests. You can easily\nconfigure your benchmarks by either using your Java methods, or by using Jenkins Configuration-as-Code plugin\nand passing the path to your YAML file.\n\nTo run benchmarks from your plugins, you need to do the following:\n\nbump up the minimum required Jenkins version to 2.60.3 or above\n\nbump Plugin-POM to a version ≥ 3.46 or manually upgrade to Jenkins Test Harness ≥ 2.51.\n\nNow, to run the benchmarks, you need to have a benchmark runner that contains a @Test so it can run\nlike a JUnit test. From inside a test method, you can use the OptionsBuilder provided by JMH to\nconfigure your benchmarks. For example:\n\npublic class BenchmarkRunner {\n    @Test\n    public void runJmhBenchmarks() throws Exception {\n        ChainedOptionsBuilder options = new OptionsBuilder()\n                .mode(Mode.AverageTime)\n                .forks(2)\n                .result(\"jmh-report.json\");\n\n        // Automatically detect benchmark classes annotated with @JmhBenchmark\n        new BenchmarkFinder(getClass()).findBenchmarks(options);\n        new Runner(options.build()).run();\n    }\n}\n\nSample benchmarks\n\nNow, you can write your first benchmark:\n\nWithout any special setup\n\n@JmhBenchmark\npublic class JmhStateBenchmark {\n    public static class MyState extends JmhBenchmarkState {\n    }\n\n    @Benchmark\n    public void benchmark(MyState state) {\n        // benchmark code goes here\n        state.getJenkins().setSystemMessage(\"Hello world\");\n    }\n}\n\nUsing Configuration as Code\n\nTo use configuration as code, apart from the dependencies above you also need to add the following\nto your pom.xml :\n\nio.jenkins\nconfiguration-as-code\n1.21\ntrue\n\nio.jenkins\nconfiguration-as-code\n1.21\ntests\ntest\n\nNow configuring a benchmark is as simple as providing path to your YAML file and specifying the class\ncontaining the benchmark state.\n\n@JmhBenchmark\npublic class SampleBenchmark {\n    public static class MyState extends CascJmhBenchmarkState {\n        @NonNull\n        @Override\n        protected String getResourcePath() {\n            return \"config.yml\";\n        }\n\n        @NonNull\n        @Override\n        protected Class getEnclosingClass() {\n            return SampleBenchmark.class;\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Benchmark\n    public void benchmark(MyState state) {\n        Jenkins jenkins = state.getJenkins(); // jenkins is configured and ready to be benchmarked.\n        // your benchmark code goes here...\n    }\n}\n\nMore Samples\n\nAs a part of this project, a few benchmarks have been created in the Role Strategy Plugin which show\nconfiguring the instances for various situations. You can find them\nhere.\n\nRunning Benchmarks\n\nRunning benchmarks from Maven\n\nTo easily run benchmarks from Maven, a Maven profile to run the benchmarks has been created\nand is available starting Plugin-POM version 3.45. You can then run your benchmarks from the\ncommand line using mvn test -Dbenchmark.\n\nRunning benchmarks on ci.jenkins.io\n\nIf you have your plugins hosted on ci.jenkins.io, you can easily run benchmarks directly from your Jenkinsfile\nby using the runBenchmarks() method after the buildPlugin() step in your which is now available in\nJenkins Pipeline library.\nThis function also accepts the path to your generated JMH benchmark reports as an optional\nparameter and archives the benchmark results. Running benchmarks in pull request builds allows you to constantly\nmonitor the performance implications of a given change. For example, the Jenkinsfile from Role Strategy Plugin:\n\nbuildPlugin()\nrunBenchmarks('jmh-report.json')\n\nVisualizing benchmark results\n\nBenchmark reports generated (in JSON) can be visualized using the either the JMH Report Plugin\nor by passing the benchmark reports to the JMH visualizer web service. As an example, here is\na visualized report of some benchmarks from the Role Strategy Plugin:\n\nThese improvements seen above were obtained through a small pull request\nto the plugin and shows how even seemingly small changes can bring major performance improvements. Microbenchmarks\nhelp to find these hot-spots and estimate the impact of changes.\n\nSome tips and tricks\n\nSince BenchmarkRunner class name in the example above does not qualify as a test according to Maven surefire plugin’s\nnaming conventions, the benchmarks will not interfere with your JUnit tests.\n\nBenchmark methods need to be annotated by @Benchmark for JMH to detect them.\n\nClasses containing benchmarks are found automatically by the BenchmarkFinder\nwhen annotated with @JmhBenchmark.\n\nA reference to the Jenkins instance is available through either JmhBenchmarkState#getJenkins() or through\nJenkins.getInstance() like you would otherwise do.\n\nJmhBenchmarkState provides setup() and tearDown() methods which can be overridden to configure the\nJenkins instance according to your benchmark’s requirements.\n\nThe benchmark builds on ci.jenkins.io are currently throttled because of the limited availability of highmem nodes.\n\nThe benchmark framework was made available in Jenkins Test Harness 2.50, it is recommended to use version 2.51 as it includes some bug fixes.\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nIf you have any feedback, comments or

Nenashev and I will be speaking at DevOps World | Jenkins World in San Francisco this year about\nScaling Network Connections from the Jenkins Controller.\nOver the years there have been many efforts to analyze, optimize, and fortify the “Remoting channel”\nthat allows a controller to orchestrate agent activity and receive build results.\nTechniques such as tuning the agent launcher can improve service,\nbut qualitative change can only come from fundamentally reworking what gets transmitted and how.\n\nIn March, jira:27035[] introduced a framework for inspecting the traffic on a Remoting channel at a high level.\nPreviously, developers could only use generic low-level tools such as Wireshark,\nwhich cannot identify the precise piece of Jenkins code responsible for traffic.\n\nOver the past few months, the\nCloud Native SIG\nhas been making progress in addressing root causes.\nThe\nArtifact Manager on S3 plugin\nhas been released and integrated with Jenkins Evergreen,\nallowing upload and download of large artifacts to happen entirely between the agent and Amazon servers.\nPrototype plugins allow all build log content generated by an agent (such as in sh steps)\nto be streamed directly to external storage services such as AWS CloudWatch Logs.\nWork has also begun on uploading JUnit-format test results, which can sometimes get big,\ndirectly from an agent to database storage.\nAll these efforts can reduce the load on the Jenkins controller and local network\nwithout requiring developers to touch their Pipeline scripts.\n\nOther approaches are on the horizon.\nWhile “one-shot” agents run in fresh VMs or containers greatly improve reproducibility,\nthey suffer from the need to transmit megabytes of Java code for every build,\nso Jenkins features will need to be built to precache most or all of it.\nWork is underway to use Apache Kafka to make channels more robust against network failures.\nMost dramatically, the proposed\nCloud Native Jenkins MVP\nwould eliminate the bottleneck of a single Jenkins controller service handling hundreds of builds.\n\nCome meet Jesse, Oleg, and other Cloud Native SIG members at\nJenkins World on September 16-19th,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Scaling Network Connections from the Jenkins
