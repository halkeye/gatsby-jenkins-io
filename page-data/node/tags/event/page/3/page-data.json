is a guest post by Mark Waite, who maintains\nthe git plugin,\nthe git client plugin,\nand is a technical evangelist for CloudBees, Inc.\n\nThe Jenkins project booth at Jenkins World 2017\nwill include the \"Pull Requests Corner\", recruiting new Jenkins contributors.\nWe think there are many people who will attend the conference without realizing how easy it is\nto help the Jenkins project, and how much the help is appreciated.\n\nMeet us in the \"Pull Requests Corner\" and we’ll help you find a way to help Jenkins.\nHere are some areas where we can use your help.\nMost of them do not require coding, and do not require a large time commitment.\n\nOne Minute Feedback on Your Version\n\nThe Jenkins changelog pages ( LTS and weekly) gather user experiences with specific Jenkins versions.\nYou can help other Jenkins users by clicking one of the weather icons in the LTS changelog (or the weekly changelog) for the release you’re using.\nChangelog feedback from weekly releases helps the release team select the long term support version.\nChangelog feedback from LTS releases helps other users prepare to upgrade.\n\nIt takes less than a minute, and helps the community (which will ultimately help you).\n\nFive Minutes to Answer a Question\n\nIn five minutes or less, you can help other Jenkins users.\n\nFor example:\n\nAnswer a question on the #jenkins channel of internet relay chat (IRC)\n\nAnswer a question on the Jenkins users mailing list\n\nAnswer a question on stackoverflow jenkins, jenkins plugins, or jenkins pipeline\n\nAnswer a question on reddit\n\nTen Minutes to Learn and Share\n\nIf you have ten minutes, you can learn something new and share what you learned.\n\nRead a Jenkins community blog post and tweet it with the hashtag #jenkinsci\n\nRead a devops.com blog post and share it on LinkedIn\n\nRead a CloudBees blog post and test drive an idea from it\n\nFind another Jenkins blog and share it (I recently discovered Matt Bajor’s ci/cd life blog)\n\nFifteen Minutes for Pipeline\n\nLiam Newman has created the \" Jenkins Minute\" video series.\nThey are brief video segments focusing on specific Jenkins functionality.\nChoose a video, watch it, and share what you learned on social media.\n\nTwenty Minutes for a Bug\n\nThe Jenkins bug tracker contains thousands of bugs.\nReviewing, duplicating, and clarifying bug reports takes time.\nWhen maintainers are reviewing, duplicating, and clarifying bug reports, they are not fixing bugs, and they are not adding new capabilities.\n\nYou can help maintainers by reviewing and duplicating a bug report that matters to you.\nA comment on a bug report is especially helpful when it confirms you’ve been able to duplicate the bug.\nIt is even more helpful if your verification includes the steps you took and how they differ from the original report.\n\nA bug report which has been duplicated, and includes clear instructions, is much more likely to receive maintainer attention.\nHelp yourself and others by duplicating bugs that matter to you.\n\nThirty Minutes for Documentation\n\nThe Jenkins documentation includes\nuser documentation ( guided tour and handbook) and\ndeveloper documentation ( tutorial, how-to guides, and reference).\nYou can help the documentation by describing something important to you clearly and completely.\n\nRefer to the instructions for documentation contributors to see how easy it is to help.\n\nForty Five Minutes for Translation\n\nIf English is not your native language, you can help with Jenkins localization.\nJenkins is used worldwide, and many users will benefit from translations.\nConsidering the rapid and continuing evolution of Jenkins, it is no surprise that there is plenty to translate.\nRefer to the internationalization guide for instructions to help you contribute translations.\n\nSixty Minutes for a Meetup\n\nLocal groups around the world meet often for Jenkins presentations, discussions, and demonstrations.\nOrganizing a Jenkins Area Meetup will introduce you to other users, and will let you explore new ways to benefit from Jenkins.\nThe team at jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com is ready to support your JAM with stickers, t-shirts, and more.\n\nWeek or More - Adopt a Plugin\n\nThe Jenkins plugin ecosystem covers a wide range of areas.\nJenkins plugin maintainers come from many different backgrounds, with many different interests.\nOften, a plugin maintainer may find that they want to do something different on the project, or they may leave the project.\nWhen a plugin maintainer is no longer able to maintain a plugin, they can place it for adoption.\n\nPlugins placed for adoption range from very specific use cases (node stalker plugin) to very general use cases (Subversion plugin).\n\nMaintaining an orphan plugin is a great way to contribute to the project.\nFollow the instructions to \" Adopt a Plugin\".\n\nSee You There!\n\nAll those techniques (and more) are available on the Jenkins participate page.\n\nLook for the \"Jenkins Needs You\" poster at Jenkins World, and come talk\nto us about the ways you can learn new things, address your concerns,\nand help Jenkins.\n\nJoin the Jenkins project at\nJenkins World on August 30-31,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Jenkins Needs You - Pull Request Corner at Jenkins World

This is opposed to the traditional way of creating a Jenkins\nproject by using the Jenkins GUI. When running your open-source load test,\nJenkins Pipeline enables resilience, execution control, advanced logic and\nVersion Control management.  This blog post will explain how to run any\nopen-source load test with Jenkins Pipeline, through Taurus.\n\nTaurus is an open source test automation framework\nthat enables running and analyzing tests from 9 open source load and functional\ntesting tools: JMeter,\nSelenium, Gatling, The Grinder, Locust, Tsung, Siege, Apache Bench, and PBench.\nTest results can be analyzed in Taurus. For advanced analyses or running tests\nin the cloud, Taurus integrates with\nBlazeMeter.\n\nGuy will be\npresenting\nmore on this topic at\nJenkins World in August,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.\n\nGetting started with Taurus\n\nInstall Taurus.\n\nCreate the following Taurus configuration in YAML. Learn more about YAML in Taurus from\nthis tutorial.\n\n## execution:\n- concurrency: 100\n  hold-for: 10m\n  ramp-up: 120s\n  scenario: Thread Group\nscenarios:\n  Thread Group:\n    requests:\n    - label: blazedemo\n      method: GET\n      url: http://blazedemo.com/\n\nThis script runs 100 concurrent users, holds the load for 10 minutes, the\nramp-up is 120 seconds and the thread group runs one GET request to\nblazedemo.com.\n\nYou can specify an executor by adding executor: to the\nscript. Otherwise, the default executor will be JMeter. In the background,\nTaurus will create an artifact directory with a jmx file (or a Scala file if\nyou run Gatling, a Python file if you are running Selenium, etc.).\n\nOpen a terminal and run: bzt.yml\n\nView the test results:\n\nIf you want to conduct an in-depth analysis of your test results, run your\ntests on BlazeMeter. You will be able to monitor KPIs through advanced and\ncolorful reports, evaluate system health over time, and run your tests from\nmultiple geo-locations.\n\nRun the following command from the terminal:\n\nbzt.yml -report\n\nIntegrate Taurus With Pipeline\n\nTo run Taurus through Pipeline, you can also go\nstraight to Jenkins after creating your Taurus script.\n\nOpen Jenkins → New Item → Fill in an item name → Click on ‘Pipeline’\n\nNow create a Pipeline script. You can include all parts of\nyour CI/CD process in this script: Commit, Build, Unit Test, Performance Test,\netc., by creating different stages.\n\nThis Pipeline has three stages: The first is called “build”. In this example it\nis empty, but you can add commands that will build your code. The second,\ncalled “Performance Tests”, creates a folder called “Taurus-Repo” and runs the\nTaurus script that we created. At the same time (note the “parallel” command),\nthere is a “sleep” command for 60 seconds. Obviously it makes no sense to put\nthose two commands together, this is just to show you the option of running 2\ncommands in parallel. The third stage called “Deploy” is also empty in this\nexample. This is where you could deploy your new version.\n\nnode {\n   stage('Build') {\n      // Run the Taurus build\n   }\n   stage('Performance Tests') {\n    parallel(\n        BlazeMeterTest: {\n            dir ('Taurus-Repo') {\n                sh 'bzt.yml -report'\n            }\n        },\n        Analysis: {\n            sleep 60\n        })\n   }\n\n   stage(‘Deploy’) {\n   }\n}\n\nNote that you can either add the Pipeline inline, or choose the “Pipeline\nscript from SCM” option and add the URL to the script on GitHub (in this case\nyou need to upload a Jenkinsfile to GitHub). With \"Pipeline from SCM\",\nwhenever you need to update the tests, you can just add new commits to the\nJenkinsfile.\n\nSave the Pipeline\n\nClick on ‘Build Now’ to run the Pipeline\n\nClick on the new Build that is running now (build #6 in this example).\n\nClick on ‘Console Output’ to see the test results:\n\nIn the Console Output you can see the test results and also the link to the report in BlazeMeter.\n\nThat’s it! Jenkins Pipeline is now running open-source load testing tools via Taurus.\n\nCome to\nmy\nfree hands-on workshop “Learn to Release Faster by Load Testing With Jenkins”\nat Jenkins World 2017 on Tuesday August 29th from 1-5pm.  You will learn how to\ntest continuously with Jenkins, JMeter, BlazeMeter and Taurus, including how to\nrun JMeter with Jenkins, run the BlazeMeter plugin for Jenkins and how to use\nopen-source Taurus.\n\nTo learn more about BlazeMeter,\nclick here.","title":"Running load tests in Jenkins Pipeline with Taurus","tags":["event","jenkinsworld"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/author/hinman","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","id":"1ddf93ad-21ef-5f16-9fd5-7a69d3fb97d3","slug":"/blog/2017/08/03/jenkinsworld-ask-the-experts/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Alyssa Tong, who runs\nthe Jenkins Area Meetup program and is also responsible for\nMarketing & Community Programs at CloudBees, Inc.\n\nThere are less than four weeks left until Jenkins World 2017.
