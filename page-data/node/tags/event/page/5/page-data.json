Among the thousands of hackers in attendance\nwere a dozen or so Jenkins contributors. We have attended the event in the\npast, but this year we had a blizzard of activity spanning four days around the FOSDEM\nweekend.\n\nFigure 1. City Hall, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nOne of our \"accidental traditions\" has become a\nhappy hour\nthe Friday night before FOSDEM truly begins at Cafe Le Roy d’Espagne on Grand\nPlace right in the middle of Brussels. Conveniently located a few hundred meters away from the\nFOSDEM Beer Event\nat Delirium Cafe, each year we are inevitably joined by friends from other open\nsource projects who know they’re welcome to join us for a few drinks.\n\nFigure 2. Cafe Le Roy, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nAfter dinner and drinks, a few of us decided it would be a good idea (it\nwasn’t) to walk over to check out the FOSDEM Beer Event and maybe have just\none more beer. For the uninitiated, Belgian beers tend to be strong, as the FOSDEM organizers warn:\n\nUnlike some other beers, Belgian beer is not just coloured water. Some beers\ncontain significant quantities of alcohol and will give you a pounding\nhangover.\n\nUnfortunately, some of us seem to re-learn this lesson each year at FOSDEM!\n\nBright and early the following day, FOSDEM really kicked off with keynotes and\nthe project tables lining a number of corridors.\n\nFigure 3. A busy hall at FOSDEM, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nAt the Jenkins project’s table we typically spend two full days answering questions,\nshowing off the latest and greatest Jenkins features, and of course handing out\nJenkins stickers. The table is where many contributors, myself included, have\na rare opportunity to talk with dozens of enthusiastic Jenkins users from\nacross the broader open source community. This year we were very fortunate to have a\ntremendous number of contributors available at the table to answer hundreds of\nquestions throughout the two days of FOSDEM.\n\nI would like to thank everybody by name, but the entire weekend was such a blur\nthat I’m not sure I would be able to remember everybody who helped! We couldn’t have\nhad a successful event without their support, so many thanks to all the\ncontributors who helped!\n\nIn addition to the Jenkins project table, we had two contributors present in\nthe\nTesting and Automation\ndevroom, which I helped organize in between answering Jenkins questions.\n\nDeclarative Pipelines in Jenkins\n\nThe first presentation was a stellar introduction to\nDeclarative Pipelines\nin Jenkins, by long-time contributor and primary developer of Declarative\nPipeline support,\nAndrew Bayer.\n\nUsing Containers for Building and Testing\n\nLater in the day,\nCarlos Sanchez,\nanother long-time contributor, maintainer of the\nKubernetes plugin and a number of Jenkins- and Maven-related\nDocker containers, provided a great overview of the current state of using\ncontainers for building and testing in Jenkins.\n\nAfter a very busy two days at FOSDEM, a few contributors remained in Brussels\nfor a day-long\nPost-FOSDEM Contributor Hackathon\nsponsored by CloudBees, Inc. and\nBetacowork Brussels. Trying to cram lots of\nhacking into a single day is challenging, so the day was mostly filled with\ndiscussions, some light prototyping, and a bit of recovery from the hectic\nweekend at FOSDEM. :)\n\nFigure 4. Daniel Beck presenting on CLI prototyping, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nThanks\n\nOf course I would like to extend many thanks to all the contributors who\nparticipated in the various FOSDEM related events, but I would call special\nattention to the logistics and planning work done by contributors Alyssa Tong,\nDamien Duportal, and Olivier Vernin. Thanks to their work coordinating all the\nplans, reservations, and schedules, we had a flawless weekend\nof high-intensity Jenkins discussion, advocacy, and hacking.\n\nI hope to see everybody back in Brussels next year for FOSDEM 2018!","title":"FOSDEM 2017 Wrap-up","tags":["fosdem","event"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Attendees learned the values of\nBlue Ocean, a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modeling\nand presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information that\nis important to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still\nstaying true to the extensibility that Jenkins always has had as a core value.\nThank you James Dumay for stopping by to take part in\nthe inauguration.\n\nSingapore, Singapore JAM\n\nOne of the members  who had several years of experience using Jenkins (since\nHudson days in fact) to present some basics on Continuous Integration with\nGitHub. It was targeted at new members who are starting out with Jenkins. We\nunderstand that we cannot always serve advanced topics to cater to the\nexperienced users and neglect the newbies so this session was targeted to help\ngive new users an introduction to Jenkins. It went well with about 15-20\nattendees and we hope to run some hands-on workshops in 2017. Some members were\nlooking forward to freebies like stickers and T-shirts too!\n\nMoscow, Russia JAM\n\nMoscow JAM leaders,\nKirill Tolkachev\nand\nOleg Nenashev\nled the inaugural meeting with\na packed full agenda. Oleg began the meeting with an update on Jenkins 2 what improvements users can expect and what\nenhancements are in the works within the Jenkins project. Following Oleg, Kirill shared\nhow his team in Alfa Laboratory used Jenkins to improve CD/DevOps in their\nprojects (with Jenkins Pipeline, Job DSL and\nBlue Ocean), the problems they experienced and how they fixed them. Then Oleg talked\nabout Jenkins Pipeline internals, main features and recent changes in the\necosystem. It was followed up by a discussion of large-scale Jenkins instances\nat the after-party.\n\nThe recording of the event can be found\non YouTube.\n\nMilan, Italy JAM\n\nThe first meetup was a great opportunity to meet local Jenkins fans to learn\nand share Jenkins experiences at a local cafe.\n\nSan Francisco, California JAM\n\nR. Tyler Croy\nperformed a 30 minutes live Pipeline coding demo to a relatively novice\naudience (though all had used Jenkins). A good amount of questions from the\naudience  which conveyed an appetite for the content being presented.\nRyan Wallner,\npresenter from ClusterHQ, also gave a demo based around Pipeline talking about\nClusterHQ’s \"Fli\" integration with a delivery pipeline.\n\nWashington, DC JAM\n\nThere was a fantastic 90% showup rate at this month’s meetup - 58 RSVPs and 52\nin attendance was pretty impressive. All this may be due to Fannie Mae’s story\n- the success of how they used Jenkins for CI/CD as part of their DevOps\nadoption. Afterwards, there was a lot of interests and further discussions\ntaking place. Next month’s host will be Freddie Mac.\n\nSeattle, Washington JAM\n\nLong time Jenkins community member and Seattle JAM leader,\nKhai Do showed how OpenStack uses \"Jenkins Job\nBuilder\" to manage and run thousands of Jenkins jobs per day in their\nmulti-controller CI/CD system.  He also compared\nJenkins Job Builder\nwith other Jenkins \"Infrastructure-as-code\" technologies - Jenkins Pipeline and\nJenkins JobDSL. It was followed by an in-depth Q&A and discussion session.\n\nDallas/Forth Worth, Texas (DFW) JAM\n\nThe November DFW JAM was the most strongly attended of the year!

Guillem Sola shared his Jenkins certification\nexperience HERE while Viktor\nFarcic presented his thoughts on the aspects of building, testing, deploying,\nand monitoring services inside Docker Swarm clusters and Jenkins\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs1ED_y5mUc.\n\nLima, Peru JAM\n\nOctober’s meetup was a joint effort with collaboration from Perú JUG, and\nDocker Lima. The first talk was an Introduction to\nDocker Ecosystem, second was\nBuilding and Testing Apps with Docker and\nArquillian Cube\nand the last one was\nCI/CD using Docker and Jenkins Pipelines.\n\nWe had a full house at the meetup. Now, everyone in the room has a Mr. Jenkins\nbranded on their laptop :)\n\nSpecial thanks to Mario Inga and\nHéctor Paz for their collaborations during the\nlast meetups.\n\nLinks\n\nStart a JAM in your city if there isn’t one already.\n\nBecome a JAM member.\n\nBecome an online JAM member\n\nBe a JAM speaker or sponsor.

There was extensive\ndiscussion of how to accomplish this goal.\n\nKeynote: The State of Jenkins 2016\n\nThe next day,\nKohsuke gave a great\nkeynote,\nshowing how far the project as come this year and where it is headed.\nYou can get the slides\nhere\nor see the full video below.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nOverall, Jenkins World was a very enjoyable event. I’m sure everyone came away having\nlearned a lot and made many new connections.  I know I’m excited to see\nwhat the coming year brings for Jenkins and the Jenkins community.\n\nDon’t forget that there are many ways to continue\nto build connections to the rest of the Jenkins community throughout the year, such as the\nJenkins Online Meetup which\nhosts online events year-round.  Or, see if there is a\nJenkins Area Meetup (JAM) near you.  If\nthere isn’t, take a look at the\nJenkins Area Meetup page to see about starting one.\n\nThanks, and I hope to see you all and Jenkins World 2017!","title":"Jenkins World 2016, That's a Wrap!","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#382818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/77b35/lnewman.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/d4a57/lnewman.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/68974/lnewman.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/ef6ff/lnewman.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/8257c/lnewman.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/6766a/lnewman.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/22bfc/lnewman.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/lnewman.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"bitwiseman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Liam started his software career as a tester, which might explain why he&#8217;s such a fan of CI/CD and Pipeline as Code.\nHe has spent the majority of his software engineering career implementing Continuous Integration systems at companies big and small.\nHe is a Jenkins project contributor and an expert in Jenkins Pipeline, both Scripted and Declarative.\nLiam currently works as a Jenkins Evangelist at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>.\nWhen not at work, he enjoys testing gravity by doing Aikido.</p>\n</div>","id":"lnewman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Liam Newman","slug":"/blog/authors/lnewman","twitter":"bitwiseman"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"event","limit":8,"skip":32,"numPages":8,"currentPage":5}},
