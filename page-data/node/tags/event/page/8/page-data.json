If the only information we had was a photograph from one angle, we’d have to do some educated guessing.\n\nAs developers, we don’t get a photograph; we get a green checkmark or a red x. We use that to decide whether or not we need to switch gears and go back to a pull request we submitted recently. At edX, we take advantage of some Jenkins features that could give us more granularity on GitHub pull requests, and make that decision less of a guessing game.\n\nMultiple contexts reporting back when they’re available\n\nPull requests on our platform are evaluated from several angles: static code analysis including linting and security audits, javascript unit tests, python unit tests, acceptance tests and accessibility tests. Using an elixir of plugins, including the GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin, we put more direct feedback into the hands of the contributor so s/he can quickly decide how much digging is going to be needed.\n\nFor example, if I made adjustments to my branch and know more requirements are coming, then I may not be as worried about passing the linter; however, if my unit tests have failed, I likely have a problem I need to address regardless of when the new requirements arrive. Timing is important as well. Splitting out the contexts means we can run tests in parallel and report results faster.\n\nDevelopers can re-run specific contexts\n\nOccasionally the feedback mechanism fails. It is oftentimes a flaky condition in a test or in test setup. (Solving flakiness is a different discussion I’m sidestepping. Accept the fact that the system fails for purposes of this blog entry.) Engineers are armed with the power of re-running specific contexts, also available through the PR plugin. A developer can say “jenkins run bokchoy” to re-run the acceptance tests, for example. A developer can also re-run everything with “jenkins run all”. These phrases are set through the GitHub Pull Request Builder configuration.\n\nMore granular data is easier to find for our Tools team\n\nSplitting the contexts has also given us important data points for our Tools team to help in highlighting things like flaky tests, time to feedback and other metrics that help the org prioritize what’s important. We use this with a log aggregator (in our case, Splunk) to produce valuable reports such as this one.\n\nI could go on! The short answer here is we have an intuitive way of divvying up our tests, not only for optimizing the overall amount of time it takes to get build results, but also to make the experience more user-friendly to developers.\n\nBen will be presenting more on this topic at\nJenkins World in September,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 20% discount off your pass.","title":"Using Jenkins for Disparate Feedback on GitHub","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/authors/hinman","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"61a711c9-9de6-5990-b29e-67f3bac971b1","slug":"/blog/2016/07/26/join-me-at-jenkinsworld/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins World, September\n13-15 at the Santa Clara Convention Center (SCCC), takes our 6th annual\ncommunity user conference to a whole new level. It will be one big party for\neverything Jenkins, from users to developers, from the community to vendors.\nThere will be more of what people always loved in past user conferences, such\nas technical sessions from users and developers, the Ask the Experts booth and\nplugin development workshop, and even more has been added, such as Jenkins\ntraining pre-conference, workshops and the opportunity to get certified for\nfree. Jenkins World is a not-to-be-missed.\n\nFor me, the best part of Jenkins World is the opportunity to meet other Jenkins\nusers and developers face-to-face. We all interact on IRC, Google Groups or\nGitHub, but when you have a chance to meet in person, the person behind the\nGitHub ID or IRC name, whose plugin you use every day, becomes a real person.\nYour motivation might be a little different from mine, but we have the breath\nin the agenda to cover everyone from new users to senior plugin developers.\n\nThis year, you’ll have more opportunities than ever before to learn about\nJenkins and continuous delivery/DevOps practices, and explore what Jenkins has\nto offer.\n\nIf you are travelling from somewhere, you might as well get a two-day Jenkins training course to be held onsite, starting Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, you can attend your choice of workshops, which gives you more hands-on time to go deeper, including:\n\nThe DevOps Toolkit 2.0 Workshop\n\nLet’s Build a Jenkins Pipeline\n\nPreparing for Jenkins Certification\n\nIntro to Plugin Development\n\nCD and DevOps Maturity for Managers\n\nOn Wednesday, the formal conference kicks off. Throughout Wednesday and\nThursday, you can choose from sessions spread across five tracks and covering\na diverse range of topics like infrastructure as code, security, containers,\npipeline automation, best practices, scaling Jenkins and new community\ndevelopment initiatives.\n\nAt Jenkins World, you’ll be exposed to projects going on in the community such\nas Blue Ocean, a new Jenkins UX project. You can\nlearn more about Jenkins 2 - a major release for the project, and based on the\nhuge number of downloads we saw in the weeks following its introduction at the\nend of April, it was a big +1. At Jenkins World, you will be immersed in\nJenkins and community, and leave knowing that you are part of a meaningful open\nsource project that, with your involvement, can do anything!\n\nThis year there will only be one Jenkins World conference, so that everyone\ninvolved in Jenkins can get together in one place at one time and actually see\neach other. I understand that it might be a bit more difficult for Jenkins\nusers outside of the US to make it to Jenkins World, but hopefully we made the\nevent worth your visit. As the final push on the back, CloudBees has created a\nspecial international program\nfor those who are coming from outside the United States.  You’ll have\ntime to talk with all of the other Jenkins users who have made the journey from\nacross the globe, you’ll be able to attend exclusive networking events and\nmore.\n\nI hope to see you September 13th through 15th in Santa Clara at\nJenkins World in Santa Clara!\n\nRegister for Jenkins World in\nSeptember with the code JWFOSS for a 20% discount off your pass.","title":"Join me for Jenkins World 2016","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2016"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":"06cd0ff0-b842-5785-b6b9-ec7c24f8ea95","slug":"/blog/2016/06/14/jenkins-world-agenda/","strippedHtml":"Join us in Santa Clara, California on September 13-15, 2016!\n\nWe are excited to announce the Jenkins\nWorld agenda is now live.

This has been a major milestone for\nJenkins and its growing community of developers, testers, designers and other\nusers in the software delivery process.\n\nWith its rising popularity and wide adoption, the Jenkins community continues to\ngrow and evolve into the millions. Jenkins community meetup activity has risen\nto an all time high since the first Jenkins meetup which was established on\nAugust 23 2010, in San Francisco.\n\nOver the last six months the number of\nJenkins Area Meetup (JAM) Groups has\ngrown from 5 to 30, with coverage in Asia, North America, South America and\nEurope.  That’s an average growth of 4 new JAMs per month.\n\nAs of today, there are over 4,100 Jenkins fans within the Jenkins meetup\ncommunity.  This is the result of contributions from community JAM leaders who\nhave volunteered their time to provide a platform for learning, sharing and\nnetworking all things Jenkins within their local communities.\n\nFor anyone who has not organized a meetup before, there are many moving parts\nthat have to come together at a specific location, date and time. This process\ntakes significant effort to methodically plan out. From planning the food and\nbeverages to securing speaker(s), a venue, audio/visual setup, technical\nlogistics and of course promoting the meetup. It does takes a level of passion\nand effort to make it all happen.\n\nMany THANKS to the 55 JAM leaders, who share this passion - they have\nsuccessfully organized over 41 meetups within the past six months in North\nAmerica, South America and Europe. That’s about 6 meetups a month!\n\nThere are still plenty of opportunities to be a JAM organizer. If there is not a\nJAM near you, we’d love to hear from\nyou!
