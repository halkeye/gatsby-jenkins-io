The Snippet Generator\n\nA second type of syntax is called “declarative syntax.”  We won’t go into detail on it here.\nBut it is a much more structured syntax that focuses on having users declare what they want in a pipeline, rather than writing the logic to make it happen.\n\nGlobal Variables\n\nIn addition to the steps that are provided by plugins, additional functionality for pipelines can be provided by global variables.\nThe simplest way to think of a global variable is as an object with methods that can be invoked on it.\nSeveral of these are built in to Jenkins, such as the Docker global variable.\nOthers can be created by users as part of the structure of a shared source code repository called a “shared pipeline library.”\n\nTo get a list of the global variables that are currently available to your Jenkins instance, you can go to the Snippet Generator screen.\nImmediately below the box for the generated pipeline script is a section titled Global Variables.\nThere, within the small print, is a link to get to the actual section (figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Link to Global Variables Reference section.\n\nClicking on that link takes us to a list of currently available Global Variables.\nIf you have the Docker Pipeline Plugin installed, you will see one at the top for Docker. (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3. Docker global variable specifics.\n\nBroadly, the docker global variable includes methods that can be applied to the Docker application, Docker images, and Docker containers.\n\nWe’ll focus first on a couple of the Docker image methods as shown in figure 4.\n\nFigure 4. Key methods for getting a Docker image.\n\nThere are multiple ways you can use these methods to create a new image.\nListing 2 shows a basic example of assigning and pulling an image using the image method.\n\nmyImage = docker.image(\"bclaster/jenkins-node:1.0\")\nmyImage.pull()\n\nListing 2: Assigning a image to a variable and pulling it down.\n\nThis can also be done in a single statement as shown in listing 3.\n\ndocker.image(\"bclaster/jenkins-node:1.0\").pull()\n\nListing 3: Shorthand version of previous call.\n\nYou can also download a Dockerfile and build an image based on it.(See listing 4.)\n\nnode() {\n    def myImg\n    stage (\"Build image\") {\n        // download the dockerfile to build from\n        git 'git@diyvb:repos/dockerResources.git'\n\n        // build our docker image\n        myImg = docker.build 'my-image:snapshot'\n    }\n}\n\nListing 4: Pipeline code to download a Dockerfile and build an image from it.\n\nFigure 5 shows the actual output from running that “Build image” stage.\nNote that the docker.build step was translated into an actual Docker build command.\n\nFigure 5. Actual Docker output from running the download and build\n\nThe Inside Command\n\nAnother powerful method available for the Docker global variable is the inside method.\nWhen executed, this method will do the following:\n\nGet an agent and a workspace to execute on\n\nIf the Docker image is not already present, pull it down\n\nStart the container with that image\n\nMount the workspace from Jenkins\n\nExecute the build steps\n\nMounting the workspace means that the Jenkins workspace will appear as a volume inside the container.\nAnd it will have the same file path.\nSo, things running in the container will have direct access to the same location.\nHowever, this can only be done if the container is running on the same underlying system - such that it can directly access the path.\n\nIn terms of executing the build steps, the inside method acts as a scoping method.\nThis means that the environment it sets up is in effect for any statement that happens within its scope (within the block under it bounded by {}).\nThe practical application here is that any pipeline “sh” steps (a call to the shell to execute something) are automatically run in the container.\nBehind the scenes, this is done by wrapping the calls with “docker exec”.\n\nWhen executed, the calls with the global variable are translated (by Jenkins) into actual Docker call invocations.\nListing 5 shows an example of using this in a script, along with the output from the first invocation of the “inside” method.\nYou can see in the output the docker commands that are generated from the inside method call.\n\nstage (\"Get Source\") {\n        // run a command to get the source code download\n        myImg.inside('-v /home/git/repos:/home/git/repos') {\n            sh \"rm -rf gradle-greetings\"\n            sh \"git clone --branch test /home/git/repos/gradle-greetings.git\"\n        }\n    }\n    stage (\"Run Build\") {\n        myImg.inside() {\n            sh \"cd gradle-greetings && gradle -g /tmp clean build -x test\"\n        }\n    }\n\nListing 5: Example inside method usage.\n\nFigure 6. Example inside method Docker command output.\n\nOnce completed, the inside step will stop the container,\nget rid of the storage, and create a record that this image was used for the build.\nThat record facilitates image traceability, updates, etc.\n\nAs you can see, the combination of using the Docker “global variable” and its “inside” method provide a simple and powerful way to spin up and work with containers in your pipeline.\nIn addition, since you are not having to make the direct Docker calls, you can invoke steps like sh within the scope of the inside method, and have them executed by Docker transparently.\n\nAs we mentioned, this is only one of several ways you can interact with Docker in your pipeline code.\nTo learn about the other methods and get hands-on practice, join me at DevOps World/Jenkins World in San Francisco or Nice for the workshop\n\" Creating a Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins 2\".\nHope to see you there!\n\nJoin the Jenkins project at\nJenkins World on September 16-19th,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Using the Docker Global Variable in Your Jenkins Pipeline","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2018","pipeline","docker"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"brentlaster","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Brent Laster is a Senior Manager in the Research and Development division at SAS in Cary, North Carolina.
