this article, I would like to share some highlights from the User Interface track of the\nJenkins UI/UX Hackfest we held on May 25..29.\nThis blog post has been slightly delayed by the infrastructure issues we had in the project,\nbut, as for improving the Jenkins UI, it is better late than never.\nKey highlights from the event:\n\nWe delivered a preview of Jenkins read-only configuration.\nDuring the hackfest we discovered and fixed many compatibility issues.\n\nWe created a new Dark Theme for Jenkins.\nWe also improved theming support in the core, and fixed compatibility in many plugins.\n\nWe contributed to the Jenkins UI accessibility, including UX testing and fixing the reported issues.\njira:JENKINS-62437[Configuration UI: Tables to divs migration] testing was the dominant story there.\n\nWe worked on a New Script Security approvals management UI\n\nWe had 54 contributors at the hackfest.\n22 of them have contributed to the user interface track as committers, testers and reviewers:\nTim Jacomb,\nUllrich Hafner,\nRaihaan Shouhell,\nSumit Sarin,\nDaniel Beck,\nRomén Rodríguez-Gil,\nwadeck Follonier,\nRunxia Ye,\nFélix Queiruga,\nAytunc Beken,\nPeter Jonsson,\nAntonio Muniz,\nKseniia Nenasheva,\nSladyn Nuner,\nAbhyudaya Sharma,\nOleg Nenashev,\nNimish Bongale,\nEsther Álvarez Feijoo,\nDenys Digtiar,\nSlavo,\nLiam Newman, and\nGavin Mogan.\nThanks to all contributors!\n\nSee the blog post below to know more about these and other user interface improvements.\n\nRead-only Jenkins Configuration\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nfeature preview announcement,\npresentation materials\n\nA read-only view of Jenkins configurations, jobs and agents is important to Jenkins Configuration-as-Code users.\nIt would allow them to access configuration and diagnostics information about their Jenkins instances while having no opportunity to occasionally change it.\nThis story is a part of the Jenkins roadmap,\nand it was featured as an area for contribution during the UI/UX hackfest.\n\nOn May 25th we have released a preview for Read-only Jenkins Configuration.\nRead the announcement by Tim Jacomb in this blogpost.\nDuring the hackfest we kept testing the change and fixing compatibility in the Jenkins plugins,\nincluding the Cloud Stats Plugin, Role Strategy Plugin, Simple Disk Usage Plugin and others.\n\nWe would appreciate feedback and testing from the Jenkins users!\nSee the blogpost for the guidelines.\n\nDark Theme\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nproject repository\n\nDark user interface themes are very popular among developers: in IDE, communication tools, etc.\nAnd there is an interest to have one for Jenkins.\nThere were a few of implementations before the hackfest, most notably camalot/jenkins-dark-stylish and a dark version of the Neo2 Theme.\nThese themes were difficult to maintain, and finally they were either removed or abandoned.\nWhat if Jenkins had an official theme?\n\nDuring the event a group of contributors focused on creating a new Dark Theme for Jenkins.\nThis effort included:\n\nPatches to the Jenkins core which simplified development and maintenance of UI themes.\nSupport for CSS variables was added, as well as PostCSS processing which helps to simplify browser compatibility.\n\nDark Theme itself.\n\nUI Testing and compatibility fixes in the core and multiple Jenkins plugins.\n\nDark theme demo with support for the development mode.\n\nYou can try out this theme starting from Jenkins 2.239.\nIt is available as a plugin from the Jenkins Update Center.\nAn example screenshot of the main page:\n\nIf you discover any Dark theme compatibility issues,\nplease report them here.\n\nJenkins Configuration UI Accessibility\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nproject page\n\nJenkins Web UI accessibility was one of the suggested topics at the event.\nWe would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.\nIt includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.\nIn general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.\nSome of the accessibility improvements we implemented during the event:\n\nAdded aria-labels to username & password input fields\n\nIndicate the language of the page in the footer (not merged yet)\n\nRemove page generation timestamp from the footer\n\nAt the UI/UX hackfest the major focus was on migrating configuration pages from tables to divs\n(jira:JENKINS-62437[]).\nIt will make them more user-friendly on narrow and especially mobile screens.\nThe change will also help users to navigate complex forms with multiple levels of nesting.\nOur progress:\n\nUser Experience testing.\nThanks to the contributors, we discovered several compatibility issues in plugins.\n\nBug fixes in several plugins\n\nA new Dockerized demo which allows to evaluate the change with a set of pre-configured plugins.\n\nHere is an example of a job configuration page using the new layout:\n\nWe will keep working on this change in the coming weeks,\nand we invite Jenkins users and Contributors to help us with testing the change!\nTesting guidelines are available in the jira:JENKINS-62437[] ticket.\n\nNew Script Security approvals management UI\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\npull request\n\nDuring the hackfest Wadeck Follonier redesigned the script approval interface in the Script Security Plugin.\nThe new UI allows viewing the list of approved scripts, shows the last access timestamp, and allows managing the approvals individually.\nBefore, it was not possible to do it from the Web interface.\nOnce the pull request is released,\nthe feature will become available to Jenkins users.\n\nOther UI improvements\n\nIn addition to the major improvements listed above,\nthere were also many smaller patches in the Jenkins core and various plugins.\nYou can find a full list of contributions to the user interface here,\nsome important improvements:\n\nImproved navigation in the Credentials plugin.\n\nSupport for wide screens in the Autograding plugin.\n\nUI Improvements in the Folder-based Authorization Strategy plugin.\n\nImproved Fingerprint listing in the Jenkins core\n\nContributing\n\nWe invite Jenkins users and contributors to join the effort and to improve the user interface together.\nThe Jenkins project gradually adopts modern frontend stacks (JavaScript, React, Gatsby, Vue.js, etc.) and design methodologies.\nFor example, see the presentation about beautifying the UI of Jenkins reporter plugins by Ullrich Hafner.\nIt is a great opportunity for frontend developers to join the project, share their experiences, experiment with new technologies, and improve the Jenkins user interface and user experience.\nJoin us!\n\nSee this page for more information about contributing to the Jenkins codebase.\nIf you want to know more, join us in the Jenkins User Experience SIG channels.\n\nReferences\n\nYou can find more information

However, most miss the opportunity to gain real insights into their build and release pipeline.  I’ll show you how you can increase observability by activating metric capture and analysis during a containerized application deployment with Jenkins X.  This  entails modifying the declarative Tekton pipelines.\n\n12:40 - 12:55pm\tFrom setup to build status on the command line Martin d’Anjou\n\nUsing bash, groovy, JCasC and the jenkins-rest, we demonstrate how to setup Jenkins from scratch, upload a configuration as code yaml file, create folders and jobs, run a build, and track it to its completion, all from the command line, without ever touching the GUI.\n\n12:55 - 1:10pm\t\tDevOps without Quality: An IT Horror Story\tLaura Keaton\n\nDevOps, the current IT Industry sweetheart, has a dark secret that has victimized organizations on their transformational journey. Investigate two case studies that left development and delivery teams in tatters and how quality engineering solutions could have prevented their disastrous outcomes.\n\n1:10 - 1:25pm\tSecuring Your Jenkins Container Pipeline with Open Source Tools Christian Wiens\n\nDiscuss the security pitfalls of containers and how embedding an open source image scanning and policy based compliance tool like Anchore into your CI/CD pipeline can mitigate this risk.\n\nThursday  August 15, 2019\n\n12:25 - 12:35pm\tResults from the 2019 Jenkins Google Summer of Code Martin d’Anjou\n\nIn 2019, the Jenkins project participated in the Google Summer of Code. This is an annual, international, program which encourages college-aged students to participate in open source projects during the summer break between classes. In 2019, we had dozens of applications and many student projects. In this session, we will showcase the students' projects and talk about what they bring to the Jenkins ecosystem.\n\n12:35 - 12:45pm\t\tPlugin installation CLI Tool Natasha Stopa\n\nThis talk will demo the new plugin installation tool done as part of a Google Summer of Code project. It will show the CLI features and how the library has been incorporated into other areas of Jenkins.\n\n12:45 - 12:55pm\t\tSysdig Secure Jenkins Plugin Marky Jackson\n\nSysdig Secure is a container security platform that brings together docker image scanning and run-time protection to identify vulnerabilities, block threats, enforce compliance, and audit activity across your microservices. The Sysdig Secure Jenkins plugin can be used in a Pipeline job, or added as a build step to a Freestyle job, to automate the process of running an image analysis, evaluating custom policies against images, and performing security scans.\n\n12:55 - 1:10pm\t\tUsing React for plugin UI Jeff Pearce\n\nThe working hours plugin has a date driven UI. During this summer’s Google Summer of Code, our student rewrite the UI in React, so that we could take advantage open source modules such as calendar pickers.

From Jenkins users, to maintainers, contributors, mentors and those new to Jenkins this event will have something for everyone.\n\nThis year’s DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco has moved to a larger venue to facilitate the growth. From August 12 - 15, 2019 the event will take place at the Moscone West Center.  The event boasts 100+ sessions, and will offer training, hands-on workshops, onsite certification, contributor summit and much more.  Conference attendees can expect to be inspired while learning the latest innovations from industry leaders. Attendees will learn the value that digital transformation has in delivering software more efficiently, more quickly and with higher quality.\n\nWe are excited to announce most of the agenda for DevOps World Jenkins World San Francisco is now live. We will continue to fill out the agenda with more sessions, trainings/workshops, and activities. Below is a small sampling of sessions from some of our favorite Jenkins contributors:\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code: try it & start contributing! - Ewelina Wilkosz\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code is an open source Jenkins plugin that allows users to keep complete Jenkins configuration in a simple configuration file (yaml format). In the talk, I’ll briefly present the history of the plugin, the vision for the future and current status. Then I’ll move to the demo section where I’ll show how easy it is to configure and run Jenkins with the help of the plugin.\n\nThinking about Jenkins Security - Mark Waite & Wadeck Follonier\n\nJenkins security concepts, authorization, authentication and auditing, secure builds, agent security, configuration and administration security, auditing, and security best practices.\n\nDocker and Jenkins [as Code] - Dr. Oleg Nenashev\n\nThe Configuration as Code plugin is a new milestone which enables managing Jenkins configurations via YAML. Together with Docker, this plugin offers many ways to produce ready-to-fly Jenkins images for any environments. In my talk, I will describe official controller and agent images offered by the Jenkins project. What’s inside them? How do you configure images with JCasC and Groovy hooks? How do you use these approaches together? And, finally, how do you simplify packaging of custom Jenkins images and define the entire system [as code]?\n\nCan Jenkins be the Engine of Mobile DevOps? - Shashikant Jagtap\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the following topics:\n\nHow mobile DevOps is different than web DevOps\n\nChallenges in mobile DevOps ( iOS and Android)\n\nHow Jenkins fits in mobile DevOps and CI/CD pipelines\n\nWhat Jenkins misses for mobile\n\nHow we can make Jenkins better for mobile apps\n\nCreating a CI/CD Pipeline for Your Shared Libraries - Roderick Randolph\n\nAt Capital One we run tens of thousands of CI/CD pipelines on Jenkins, leveraging the Jenkins Pipeline shared libraries extension to enable code reuse and decrease time to market for dev teams. A code change to our shared library goes live immediately and is consumed the next time a team triggers their project’s pipeline. So, why do we have such high confidence that a code change to our library won’t break a team’s pipeline? The answer: we’ve developed a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for our shared library.\n\nDuring this talk, you will learn how to create a fully automated pipeline for your shared libraries including how to develop tests, create canary releases, monitor for issues and quickly rollback changes to your shared library to achieve rapid delivery while minimizing any impact on dev teams.\n\nHow Jenkins Builds and Delivers Jenkins in the Cloud - Brian Benz & Tyler Croy\n\nWant to know how Jenkins builds Jenkins?
