Token usage tracking\n\nYou can revoke API tokens.\nWhen you know that you are not using a given token anymore, you can revoke it to reduce the risk of it getting used by unauthorized users.\nSince you can have multiple API tokens, this allows fine-grained control over which scripts, hosts, or applications are allowed to use Jenkins as a given user.\n\nMigrating to new API tokens\n\nTo help administrators migrate their instances progressively, the legacy behavior is still available, while new system is also usable.\n\nOn the user configuration page, the legacy token is highlighted with a warning sign,\nexplaining that users should revoke it and generate a new one (if needed) to increase security.\n\nFigure 2. Legacy token renewal still possible\n\nNew options for administrators\n\nIn order to let administrators control the pace of migration to the new API token system,\nwe added two global configuration options in the \"Configure Global Security\" page in the brand new \"API Token\" section:\n\nAn option to disable the creation of legacy API tokens on user creation.\n\nAn option to disable the recreation of legacy API tokens by users, forcing them to only use the new, unrecoverable API tokens.\n\nBoth options are disabled by default for new installations (the safe default), while they’re enabled when Jenkins is upgraded from before 2.129.\n\nFigure 3. Security Configuration options\n\nFigure 4. Remove legacy token and disable the re-creation\n\nNew administrator warnings\n\nWhen upgrading to Jenkins 2.129, an administrative monitor informs admins about the new options described above, and recommend disabling them.\n\nAnother administrative warnings shows up if at least one user still has a legacy API token.\nIt provides central control over legacy tokens still configured in the Jenkins instance, and allows revoking them all.\n\nFigure 5. Legacy token monitoring page\n\nSummary\n\nJenkins API tokens are now much more flexible: They allow and even encourage better security practices.\nWe recommend you revoke legacy API tokens as soon as you can, and only use the newly introduced API tokens.","title":"Security Hardening: New API token system in Jenkins 2.129+","tags":["community","core","security","upgrade"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/c09ea/wadeck.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/534e5/wadeck.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/99887/wadeck.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/c09ea/wadeck.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/5f0ee/wadeck.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/59a6b/wadeck.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/cbb78/wadeck.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/96250/wadeck.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/608b05a5037fd519ec3cc8b218de672d/890ef/wadeck.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":171}}},"blog":null,"github":"wadeck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Wadeck is a member of the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>, working on fixes and improvements to Jenkins security.\nHe likes to provide solutions that are both useful and easy to use.</p>\n</div>","id":"wadeck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Wadeck Follonier","slug":"/blog/authors/wadeck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":"c68773a2-1f81-56bc-af65-71e0703df409","slug":"/blog/2018/06/27/new-login-page/","strippedHtml":"This blog post gives an introduction to the new design for the login and signup forms and Jenkins is (re)starting pages introduced in Jenkins 2.128.\nThe first part of the blog post is an introduction to the new design and UX for Jenkins users.\nThe later part is talking about extensibility in a more technical manner, aimed at plugin developers.\n\nOverview\n\nThe recent changes to some core pages provide new design and UX and further dropping all external dependencies to prevent\nany possible malicious javascript introduced by third party libraries.\nTo be clear, this never was an issue with previous releases of Jenkins, but having read this article, this author believes that the article has good points and leading by example may raise awareness of data protection.\n\nThis meant to drop the usage of the jelly layout lib (aka xmlns:l=\"/lib/layout\") and as well the page decorators it\nsupported. However there is a new SimplePageDecorator extension point (discussed below) which can be used to modify the look and feel for the login and sign up page.\n\nThe following pages have given a new design:\n\nJenkins is (re)starting pages\n\nLogin\n\nSign up\n\nUX enhancement\n\nForm validation has changed to give inline feedback about data validation errors in the same form.\n\nLogin\n\nSign up\n\nThe above image shows that the validation is now done on all input fields instead of before breaking on the\nfirst error found, which should lead to fewer retry cycles.\n\nInstead of forcing the user to repeat the password, the new UX introduces the possibility to display the password in\nclear text. Further a basic password strength meter indicates password strength to the user while she enters the password.\n\nCustomizing the UI\n\nThe re-/starting screens do not support the concept of decorators very well, hence the decision to not support them for these pages.\n\nThe SimplePageDecorator is the key component for customization and uses three different files to\nallow overriding the look and feel of the login and signup pages.\n\nsimple-head.jelly\n\nsimple-header.jelly\n\nsimple-footer.jelly\n\nAll of the above SimplePageDecorator Jelly files are supported in the login page. The following snippet is a minimal excerpt\nof the login page, showing how it makes use of SimplePageDecorator.\n\nThe sign-up page only supports the simple-head.jelly:\n\nSimplePageDecorator - custom implementations\n\nHave a look at Login Theme Plugin, which allows you to\nconfigure your own custom content to be injected into the new login/sign-up page.\n\nTo allow easy customisation the decorator only implements one instance by the principal \"first-come-first-serve\".\nIf jenkins finds an extension of the SimplePageDecorator it will use the Jelly files provided by that plugin.\nOtherwise Jenkins will fall back to the default implementation.\n\n@Extension\npublic class MySimplePageDecorator extends SimplePageDecorator {\n   public String getProductName() {\n     return \"MyJenkins\";\n   }\n}\n\nThe above will take override over the default because the default implementation has a very low ordinal ( @Extension(ordinal=-9999))\nIf you have competing plugins implementing SimplePageDecorator, the implementation with the highest ordinal will be used.\n\nAs a simple example, to customize the logo we display in the login page, create a simple-head.jelly with the following content:\n\nTo customize the login page further, create a simple-header.jelly like this:\n\nWelcome to ${it.productName}!\n\nFor example, I used this technique to create a prototype of a login page for a CloudBees product I am working on:\n\nConclusion\n\nWe hope you like the recent changes to some core pages and as well the new design and UX. We further hope you feel enabled to\ncustomize the look and feel to adopt your needs with the SimplePageDecorator.","title":"New design, UX and extensibility digest for login page et.

refer to Running Jenkins on Java 11 documentation to have the up-to-date details on how to run Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nGuidelines in this blogpost are rendered obsolete by the Java 11 Support Preview Availability\nannouncement on Dec 13, 2018 and by the Java 11 GA release on Sep 25, 2018.\nSee the Java support page\nfor up-to-date information about running Jenkins with Java 11.\nThe Jenkins project also no longer ships preview versions for Java 10.\n\nAs you probably know, we will have a\nJenkins and Java 10+ online hackathon this week.\nIn order to enable early adopters to try out Jenkins with new Java versions,\nwe have updated Jenkins core and Docker packages.\nStarting from Jenkins 2.127,\nweekly releases can be launched with Java 10 and Java 11 (preview).\nAlthough there are some known compatibility issues,\nthe packages are ready for evaluation and exploratory testing.\n\nThis article explains how to run Jenkins with Java 10 and 11 using Docker images and WAR files.\nIt also lists known issues and provides contributor guidelines.\n\nRunning in Docker\n\nIn order to simplify testing, we have created a new\njenkins/jenkins-experimental\nrepository on DockerHub.\nThis repository includes various Jenkins Core images, including Java 10 and Java 11 images.\nWe have also set up development branches and continuous delivery flows for Jenkins core,\nso now we can deliver patches for these images without waiting for weekly releases.\n\nYou can run the image simply as:\n\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins-experimental:latest-jdk11\n\nThe following tags are available:\n\n2.127-jdk10, 2.128-jdk10 - Weekly releases packaged with Java 10\n\n2.127-jdk11, 2.128-jdk11 - Weekly releases packaged with Java 11\n\nlatest-jdk10 - Jenkins core build from the java10-support branch\n\nlatest-jdk11 - Automatic build from the core’s java11-support branch.\n\nblueocean-jdk10, blueocean-jdk11 - Experimental build, which bundles all Jenkins Pipeline and\nBlue Ocean patches required to run on Java 11.\nIf you want to try Pipeline, use this image\n\nJava 10/11 images are fully compatible with the official\njenkins/jenkins\nDocker image documentation,\ne.g. you can use plugins.txt to install plugins, mount volumes and pass extra options via environment variables.\n\nRunning Jenkins without Docker\n\nJava 10\n\nDownload Jenkins WAR for 2.127 or above\n(or build the experimental branch)\n\nRun WAR with the following command:\n\n${JAVA10_HOME}/bin/java --add-modules java.xml.bind -jar jenkins.war \\\n    --enable-future-java --httpPort=8080 --prefix=/jenkins\n\nJava 11\n\nDownload Jenkins WAR for 2.127 or above\n(or build the experimental branch)\n\nDownload the following libraries to the same directory as jenkins.war\n\njaxb-api-2.3.0.jar (save as jaxb-api.jar)\n\njaxb-core-2.3.0.1.jar (save as jaxb-core.jar)\n\njaxb-impl-2.3.0.1.jar (save as jaxb-impl.jar)\n\njavax.activation v.1.2.0 (save as javax.activation.jar)\n\nRun the following command:\n\nRun Jenkins with ${JAVA11_HOME}/bin/java \\\n    -p jaxb-api.jar:javax.activation.jar --add-modules java.xml.bind,java.activation \\\n    -cp jaxb-core.jar:jaxb-impl.jar \\\n    -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java --httpPort=8080 --prefix=/jenkins\n\nCurrent state\n\nAs of June 17, we have achieved the following state:\n\nJenkins 2.127+ starts up successfully with\nOpenJDK 10.0.1 and\nOpenJDK 11+17-Debian-2 (preview)\n\nIt is possible to configure and run simple Freestyle jobs\n\nJenkins agents are able to start on Java 10, to connect to the controller and to execute Freestyle jobs\n\nAgents can be connected using Docker Plugin and Yet Another Docker Plugin\n\nJob DSL plugin works well on demo projects\n\nMaven Integration plugin can build\nplugin-pom -based\nJenkins plugins when running on agents with JDK 8\n\nIt is possible to create Folders and manage items in them\n\nIt is possible to configure Jenkins using Configuration-as-Code plugin\n\nJenkins is able to execute Groovy scripts in Script Console and\nGroovy Hooks\n\nKnown issues\n\nSo far we know about the following issues:\n\nPipeline crashes immediately on Java 10 and 11 ( JENKINS-46602)\n\nWorkaround: Pipeline: Support plugin should be updated to version 3.0-java11-alpha-1-rc684.d802f5d9aeed from the Incrementals repo\n( download)\n\nFIXED - Git Client plugin 2.7.2 cannot be installed when running with Java 11 build 18ea\n\nThere are many warnings about Illegal reflective access during execution\n(linked in JENKINS-40689).\n\nIn current Java 10 and 11 releases it does not lead to failures,\nbut we want to cleanup these warnings anyway\n\nFIXED - Configuration-as-Code plugin fails to export configurations on Java 10\n( JENKINS-51991)\n\nWe anticipate to discover and report more issues during the hackathon this week.\n\nContributing\n\nIf you discover incompatibilities in plugins, please\nreport issues in our bugtracker.\nWe have java10 and java11 labels for such issues.\n\nIf you are interested to try out Jenkins with Java 10 and 11 before June 22nd,\nyou may be interested to sign-up to the Jenkins and Java 10+ online hackathon.\nEverybody is welcome to join, independently of their Jenkins experience and amount of time they have available.\nExploratory testing is also within the hackathon’s scope.\nDuring this event, please also use the java10_hackathon label.\nIt will help us to track contributions and send folks some small \"thank you\" gifts for participating (details will be figured out during the hackathon).\n\nIf you want to contribute patches to the core,\nplease submit pull requests to java10-support or\njava11-support branches.\nIf the patches are compatible with Java 8, we will try to upstream them to weekly releases.\nFor plugin patches please create pull requests against main branches and then follow guidelines from plugin maintainers.\nIf you need additional reviews and you are a member of the jenkinsci organization,\nfeel free to mention the @jenkinsci/java10-support team in your PRs.\n\nLinks:\n\nDocker: jenkins/jenkins-experimental

sort of slid under the radar in the middle of some bigger changes\nfor the JEP-202\nreference implementation, so I wanted to call it out now. Arguably this could\ndeserve a retroactive JEP, though I would rather fold it into a JEP for\nJENKINS-49651 (see below).\n\nAs of Jenkins 2.118, or plugin parent POM 3.7, you can mark any Java member\n( class, method, constructor, field, or I suppose also interface,\nenum, or annotation) with API visibility ( protected or public) with an\nannotation :\n\n@Restricted(Beta.class)\n\nThe idea is to announce to potential users of the member that the API\nmay still be in flux and only code prepared to keep up should be using\nit. For an example, 2.118 added a VirtualFile.toExternalURL() method\nthat is being implemented in artifact-manager-s3 and (pending some\nPR merges) called in copyartifact and workflow-basic-steps. We do\nnot necessarily want this to be called yet by unknown parties out\nthere in the Jenkins ecosystem. To enforce that, any attempt to call\nor implement toExternalURL will produce a build failure, unless you\nadd this property to your plugin POM, as these plugins have done:\n\ntrue\n\nWhy? Because there is a chance the design is wrong and it might need\nto be changed—perhaps some upcoming bug fix would demand a boolean\nparameter be added, for example.\n\nUnder the conventional notion of Jenkins API deprecation and compatibility\npolicy, once an API like this makes it into a release version, that is it—we\nmight mark it @Deprecated but we need to maintain compatibility indefinitely,\nand find some way to migrate existing implementations / call sites.\n\nWith the @Beta annotation, that promise is not being made. If it needs\na boolean parameter for some reason, that will be added and those\nthree plugins updated to match; we are not going to bother retaining\nthe original overload and somehow delegating to the new one. This\nsimplification of the developer workflow is important to the use cases\nof Essentials (JEP-3xx), and I would expect the useBeta mark to\nbecome widespread among plugins included in Essentials. Such as the situation\nwhere one team needs to feel\ncomfortable refactoring code under its aegis freely, and the refactored result\nshould be deliverable as a unit to production via the Evergreen distribution\nsystem.\n\nSo that leaves two important questions:\n\nFirst, is the annotation\npermanent, and if not, when should it be removed? I do not think there\nis any hard policy, but the intention is that it should be removed\nonce the API is in more or less widespread use and has held up. For\nthis example, if people start using S3 artifacts, and especially if\nsomeone successfully writes an implementation of artifact storage in\nAzure that uses the API, the concept will have been reasonably proven.\nAt that point we want the API to be used wherever it would make sense,\nand if there is some very belated realization that the design is not\nquite right, we accept the burden of deprecating the original and\nmigrating callers compatibly.\n\nSecond, it is fine and well to say that someone changing the signature\nof a beta toExternalURL is on the hook to update the three plugins\nusing it, but what if a Jenkins admin ( not running Essentials, for\nshame) upgrades to (say) Jenkins 2.125 with the new signature but\ndeclines to accept the updates to those plugins (say,\nworkflow-basic-steps 2.9) which adapt to the change? It is not\nenough to say that it is their fault for holding back on the updates\narbitrarily; the plugin manager offers you updates but does nothing\nto tell you when they are required, so suddenly throwing\nNoSuchMethodError is not a helpful response.\n\nThe solution needs to be ironed out, but my expectation is to use\nJENKINS-49651\nfor this. For example, workflow-basic-steps 2.8,\nusing toExternalURL(), would have declared itself compatible with\nJenkins-Version: 2.118, and thus implicitly anything newer. The\ndeveloper doing the refactoring would also amend some 2.125 (and\nnewer) core metadata to say that it conflicts with anything older than\nthe 2.9 release of the plugin. The plugin manager would therefore\nblock the 2.8 plugin from even being loaded on the 2.125 core; the\nadmin would need to update before using it. In the case of an\nincompatible change made to a plugin API, rather than a core API, the\nUX is a little smoother since the plugin manager could just refuse to\nlet you update one without the other.\n\nIf you’re a plugin or core developer who is interested in using the @Beta\nannotations, or have questions about our motiviations, please join the\ndiscussion on\nthis mailing list thread.","title":"Using new core APIs with the Beta annotation","tags":["core","developer","plugin"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"jglick","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jesse

is a post about a major change in Jenkins, which is available starting\nfrom Jenkins 2.102 and Jenkins LTS 2.107.1.\nThis is a change with a serious risk of regressions in plugins.\nIf you are a Jenkins administrator, please read this blogpost and\nupgrade guidelines\nBEFORE upgrading.\n\nI would like to provide some heads-up about the\nJEP-200 change,\nwhich is included into the new Jenkins LTS 2.107.x baseline.\n\nBackground\n\nFor many years Jenkins used to specifically blacklist certain classes and packages according to known or suspected exploits.\nThis approach has been proven unsustainable due to the risk of deserialization attacks via unknown classes\nfrom 3rd-party components, after the\nSECURITY-429/CVE-2017-1000353 fix in 2.46.2\nit was decided to replace blacklists by more restrictive whitelists.\nIn October 2017 Jesse Glick proposed a Jenkins Enhancement Proposal,\nwhich finally got accepted as JEP-200.\n\nThe change implies a risk of regressions in plugins serializing non-whitelisted Java-internal and 3rd-party classes,\nand that’s why it is so important to follow the upgrade guidelines for this release.\n\nCurrent state\n\nJEP-200 was first integrated in Jenkins 2.102 (released in January 2018), and it has got a lot of testing since that.\nSee this blogpost for the original announcement.\n\nOver the last two months we received more than 75 issues from users of Jenkins weekly releases.\nAll these issues have been triaged, and we have released most of the fixes.\nMore than 50 plugins were fixed in total, and many more plugins were updated in order to enable compatibility testing.\nA significant part of the discovered regressions were caused by real defects which were causing performance and stability\nissues in plugins.\nThanks a lot to all the Jenkins contributors and plugin maintainers who helped deliver timely changes for this effort!\n\nOver last 6 weeks Jenkins weekly releases had positive community ratings,\nthe overall JEP-200 adoption reached ~12% of all Jenkins installations on March 01.\nAll major plugins have been also tested directly or verified in the wild on weekly releases.\nSo we are confident that the change is ready to be released in LTS.\n\nOn the other hand, we continue to receive JEP-200 regression reports.\nThey are mostly caused by niche plugins which are not widely used in weekly releases,\nand unfortunately not all fixes have been released yet (see the Wiki page for up-to-date info).\nWe anticipate more regressions to be reported after the LTS release and broader adoption.\n\nIn order to simplify the upgrade to the new LTS baseline,\nI have prepared some helpful materials together with Liam Newman\nand Jesse Glick.\nBelow you can find the embedded slide deck and video, or scroll down to see the key information\nin the text form.\n\nVideo:\n\nFor Jenkins administrators\n\nUpgrading to a core with JEP-200 requires a special update procedure, which is described below.\n\nUpgrading Jenkins\n\nJEP-200 is not the only major change in 2.107.1, please read\nthe full upgrade guide carefully\n\nIf you have a way of testing the upgrade before applying it to production, do it\n\nBack up your instance so you have any easy way of rolling back\n\nUpdate all affected plugins.\nSee this Wiki page for the list of affected plugins,\nfix statuses and workarounds\n\nApply workarounds for non-released patches if needed (see below)\n\nUpdate to the new version of the Jenkins core\n\nUsing backups and staging servers is good advice before any upgrade but especially this one,\ngiven the relatively high risk of regression.\nDue to the nature of the changes, some plugins may refuse to load after the upgrade and cause your Jenkins service to fail to start.\n\nAfter the upgrade\n\nTo the extent that advance testing of the impact of this change on popular plugins has been completed,\nmost users (and even plugin developers) should not notice any difference.\nStill, it is highly advised to monitor your system after the upgrade, especially the following:\n\nJenkins System log (especially during the startup)\n\nJob/Build logs\n\nIf you do encounter a log message referencing the https://jenkins.io/redirect/class-filter/ URL,\nmost likely it is a JEP-200 regression.\nExample:\n\nsome.pkg.and.ClassName in file:/var/lib/jenkins/plugins/some-plugin-name/WEB-INF/lib/some-library-1.2.jar might be dangerous, so rejecting; see https://jenkins.io/redirect/class-filter/\n\nIf you see this kind of message, we highly recommend reporting it so that it can be investigated and probably fixed quickly.\n\nReporting JEP-200 issues\n\nStarting from May 01, JEP-200 issues are triaged by plugin and core maintainers.\nJEP-200 maintainers are available for code reviews if needed,\nbut they will not be reviewing cases in JIRA and searching for miscategorized issues on a daily basis.\nIf you experience new JEP-200 regressions, please follow the guidelines below.\n\nPlease report any issues you encounter matching the above pattern in the\nJenkins issue tracker, under the appropriate plugin component.\nBefore reporting please check whether this issue has already been reported.\n\nAdd the JEP-200 label\n\nInclude the stacktrace you see in the log\n\nIf possible, include complete steps to reproduce the problem from scratch\n\nYou can find examples of previously reported issues using this query.\n\nJenkins developers will evaluate issues and strive to offer a fix in the form of a core and/or plugin update.\nRight after the feature release there was be a special team triaging the reports.\nStarting from May 01 the issues will be triaged by plugin and core maintainers.\nSee JEP-200 Maintenance plan for more info.\n\nFor more details and current status, see\nPlugins affected by fix for JEP-200.\n\nApplying workarounds\n\nAssuming you see no particular reason to think that the class in question has dangerous deserialization semantics, which is rare,\nit is possible to work around the problem in your own installation as a temporary expedient.\nNote the class name(s) mentioned in the JEP-200 log messages,\nand run Jenkins with the hudson.remoting.ClassFilter startup option, e.g.:\n\njava -Dhudson.remoting.ClassFilter=some.pkg.and.ClassName,some.pkg.and.OtherClassName -jar jenkins.war ...\n\nThis workaround process may require several iterations, because classes whitelisted in the workaround may also\ninclude fields with types requiring whitelisting.\n\nFor plugin developers\n\nIf you are a plugin developer, please see the original JEP-200 announcement.\nThat blog post provides guidelines for testing and fixing plugin compatibility after the JEP-200 changes.\nThe presentation above also provides some information about what needs to be tested.","title":"Security hardening:
