While I have my doubts about whether a brand-new package manager was a good way of spending engineering resources, OpenSolaris had a number of very nice features that made it a convincing platform to run Jenkins, thanks to SMF, ZFS, and zones. So I used to produce IPS packages for Jenkins.

Instead, what it does mean, is that the Jenkins mainline is much more friendly to runtime analysis of classes with which it is not familiar.\n\nThe problem\n\nWhen analyzing plugin classes, Jenkins uses just about every kind of metadata you can think of to get information about them: Class name, Field names, method names, member modifiers, annotations, you name it. It even uses the containing class relationship for inner classes to match Descriptors with what they describe.\n\nIt’s all a great example of convention over configuration (CoC). In fact, I’ve never really seen CoC implemented in a Java project before as successfully as it has been in Jenkins. Plugin authors don’t have to duplicate any metadata that Jenkins can figure out for you — and it’s alot! The drawback though, is that extensions depend very heavily on conforming to the structure of a conventional Java class.\n\nThe changes in this merge, and in several of the modules on which Jenkins depends, allow more than ever to get this information by asking an object directly rather than querying its private class structure.\n\nThe Kicker\n\nMany of theses changes aren’t even JRuby specific! While they do enable JRuby integration, They’re really just making things more friendly for dynamic languages in general. So, in theory, it should pave the way for others like JavaScript and Python.\n\nWhere now?\n\nWe’re still working on the ruby runtime and tools which will provide as crisp a Ruby development experience as we can. I don’t want to proffer an estimate of when those will begin to be useable, but it is important to mark this very important milestone and explain what it does and does not mean.\n\nWe need you!\n\nThere is still much work to be done to enable a writing Jenkins plugins in Ruby, we are looking for people who know Ruby and feel like pitching in: writing Rake tasks, improving the glue layer, documentation, etc.\n\nIf you’re interested, most of the action is happening on the jenkinsrb@googlegroups.com mailing list, so join us!","title":"JRuby Branch merged!","tags":["development","core","jenkinsci","ruby","jruby"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"cowboyd","html":"","id":"cowboyd","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Charles Lowell","slug":"/blog/authors/cowboyd","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"cb3ffe27-cb69-54a2-a9a7-d1b0c74e1071","slug":"/blog/2011/06/24/ruby-plugins-hack-session-notes-6-23-2011/","strippedHtml":"You know that the night is going to be productive whenever @kohsukekawa shows up, and last night was no exception. We talked about problems on the horizon, potential solutions, and then I spent the last half hour ripping a bit of code.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that most of the changes that have to be done to Jenkins core have already been made, so now the bulk of the heavy lifting falls to the Ruby side of things (right now, me).\n\nAnyhow, on to the notes!\n\nAttendees\n\n@kohsukekawa, @cowboyd\n\nextract more stuff into the jenkins-plugins.rb support library (@cowboyd)\n\nWe’re in the process of extracting, normalizing, documenting all the goop that’s currently residing in the ruby plugins playground into a formal plugin support gem called jenkins-plugins https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugins.rb\n\nrecruit Rubyists to implement non-Jenkins specific code (@kohsukekawa)\n\nIf you know Ruby and would like to be able to write Jenkins plugins with it, but don’t know the first thing about Jenkins and/or JRuby, that’s OK.

That means that as we extract the plugin support library, we take make sure you can test plugin classes in isolation.\n\nOn the Jenkins side, KK will think about how to run tests that require a full Jenkins environment. A system like this exists currently for testing java plugins, but some thought might be required on how to do this for Ruby.\n\npackaging reloaded (@kohsukekawa)\n\nKK is going to jump in and write some rake tasks to take a ruby plugin structure and package it into a valid .hpi file, and with no maven involved.  According to him, Ruby plugins aren’t the only system that wants to run maven-free. There is desire to be able to do plugin development with Gradle (another Java build system), so this could be a double win.\n\ndifferent schedule (@kohsukekawa)\n\n8:30pm Central in North America, doesn’t seem to be a very good time.

This release line branches off from a bit old Jenkins release (in this case 1.409), and we will only put important backported bug fixes. We’ll keep releasing 1.409.2, 1.409.3, and so on, as such bugs appear, and in several months (our current thinking is 3 months) we’ll designate another release and repeat this process all over again. I think it provides more comfortable upgrade path for larger deployments. For more about this, see Wiki.\n\nIn large companies that use Jenkins in a large scale, there often is a team of people who looks at incoming Jenkins release, tests it with their environments and their plugins, and then let their internal group consume them. With this release line, I’m calling for them to join the effort on this branch. Vojtech Juranek from Red Hat is already helping us tremendously, so is Yahoo in choosing the base release line and backporting. But it’d be great to get more people on board, as I think it’ll benefit everyone to have a larger number of eyeballs on the same code.
