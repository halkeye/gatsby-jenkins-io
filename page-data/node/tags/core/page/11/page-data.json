About 10 people came, including the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Static+Code+Analysis+Plug-ins[static code analysis plugin] fame Ullrich Hafner, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin[Androd emulator plugin] fame https://twitter.com/orrc[Christopher Orr], the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin[instant messenger plugin] (and others) fame https://twitter.com/#!/kutzi[Christoph Kutzinski]. Some of us came from pretty far away places like Munich, Bonn, and Netherland. There was a good mix of existing developers and new developers, too. +\n +\n\n+\nDuring the hackathon, new folks developed whopping three plugins — a security realm that connects to https://github.com/jenkinsci/kerberos-authenticator-plugin[Kerberos (password entering kind, not SSO)], https://github.com/jenkinsci/builton-column-plugin[a plugin that adds a list view column to show where the last build was done], and https://github.com/jenkinsci/extra-columns-plugin/[another plugin that attempts to collect small list view column implmentations]. German translations were improved, automated installation of Android SDKs are discussed and its implementation strategies explained. I've done my share of contribution by working on https://github.com/jenkinsci/jruby-xstream[XStream support for JRuby], which is one of the ground work necessary for JRuby-based Jenkins plugin development, and I also showed the prototype Groovy-based templating that can potentially supercede Jelly. There were additional exchange of tips and tricks, how you do this and that. +\n +\n\n+\nStrong coffee and engaged conversations kept me awake all day, although German keyboard layout (on top of usual IDE difference + Mac/PC difference) made it hard to code on other people's computers, but all in all it was a very productive hackathon. In fact, the best ever. We wrapped up around 7pm and headed to a seafood restaurant near Elbe river, stayed there until 11pm-ish. +\n +\n\n+\nThe next hackathon is planned in Paris toward the end of the month.

But better late than never...). As with https://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/04/22/hudson-hits-1300?force=752[1.300] and https://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2008/03/hudson_hits_120.html?force=824[1.200], this release doesn't particularly signify any substantial major release, but nonetheless it is a milestone for those of us who are involved in the project — I think repeating something 400 times is something one can be proud of. It's a bit like climbing a mountain. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, ... and when you look up, voila! +\n +\n\n+\nIn 2 years since 1.300, which was April 2009, we've added a lot of features. We now have a CLI to manipulate the server, auto-installation of JDK/Ant/Maven to simplify cluster management, concurrent builds of the same job, community-contributed localizations to 20+ languages, boolean expression over the job/label assignment control, parallel initialization based on a dynamically built acyclic directed graph, console annotations to enrich the build output, far more extensible queue (that enabled a lot of plugins), Windows 7 / Vista support, improved controller/agent communication stability, Maven 3 support, and then all around performance improvements, in memory footprint, in startup time, and in page rendering speed. +\n +\n\n+\nAnd of course, we had to change the name of the project. That was a real distraction, but now that the divorce is over, things have been https://bobbickel.blogspot.com/2011/03/jenkins-vs-hudson-time-to-upgrade.html[moving well] for Jenkins. I guess any organization (including any sizable OSS project) is really more than sum of all individuals. If you take a store of Target and replace all its workers by those of nearby Staples, it'll probably not work out well. I think https://jenkins-ci.org/why[people understand that]. +\n +\n\n+\nAnd on the positive side, I do think we came out stronger. We are now running https://jenkins-ci.org/node/280[governance meetings on IRC], we now have https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins[somewhat more formal governance structure]. The core development is actually accelarating with the help of https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/graphs/impact[many new developers], such as Olivier Lamy, (scroll to the right), and https://twitter.com/#!/jenkins_release[plugin releases kept coming at amazing rate] — we are now at 350+ plugins, more than doubled since 1.300. +\n +\n\n+\nLooking at future, we are working on a number of new initiatives in the community, too. For example, Arnaud Héritier is working on revisiting https://issues.jenkins.io/[our JIRA project structure], Andrew Bayer is running a contest for new logo, Tyler is in process of getting additional hardwares at OSUOSL for the project. I'm also doing a lot of things, but for example, I'm going to write a proposal to start a stable patch releases of Jenkins that only consists of backported important bug fixes, in addition to the current weekly release model. Several large users maintain private branches of Jenkins, and so I think it makes a lot of sense for those folks to align their efforts around this release line. I'm also thinking that we could launch a community acceptance testing (CAT) effort around this, much like https://qa.netbeans.org/processes/cat/67/faqs.html[NetBeans] and https://glassfish.java.net/quality/portal/[GlassFish] have done it. I think the first stable release line would branch off from 1.400, so if anything that's another reason you should upgrade to 1.400. +\n +\n\n+\nWhen I reflect on the project, I'm surprised at just how much work there is to be done, after so much that has been achived. But I'm still excited at what we can do with this platform. I thank everyone for their continued patoronage of Jenkins, and I hope to see more of you in the mailing lists, in the chat rooms, and in the meet-up events.
