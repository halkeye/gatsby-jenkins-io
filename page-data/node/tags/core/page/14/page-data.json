The first post over on Kohsuke.org welcomes us:\n\nFor the longest time I haven’t really done anything about kohsuke.org, but as I left Sun/Oracle, I decided to put a bit more effort into it.

I say that he is leaving Sun, instead of leaving Oracle as Kohsuke worked at Sun for nine years and Oracle only a few months. In those nine years at Sun, Kohsuke has worked on some great products, the most notable of them being Hudson.\n\nPer Kohsuke’s post:\n\nWhere am I heading next? I’m actually starting my own company to take Hudson to the next stage.\n\nWhat this means for Hudson still isn’t certain yet, fortunately it means that Hudson will continue to have at least one full-time developer. It remains to be seen where KohsukeCorp (the name has not yet been disclosed) will focus within the Hudson code-base. For the greater user-base of Hudson, this means that the schedule for releases may slow down during this transitional period, there are some logistics to work out with Oracle regarding some of the hardware Hudson has traditionally used to host JIRA, this blog, and a number of other machines helping support the Hudson project in one fashion or another.\n\nThe next couple of months will be interesting for the Hudson community; as per usual you’ll be able to get the latest updates from this blog or the @hudsonci twitter account. I’ll let Kohsuke finish this post off:\n\nAnd finally, big thank you to everyone in the Hudson community, and in a broader java.net community.

When I sat down to write the inaugural post, Welcome to Continuous Blog, I set forth a few goals:\n\nHelp advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community\n\nBe a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson users of all skill-levels\n\nRecognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their efforts\n\nBeing a community resource, I wanted to review our progress on those goals along with some other interesting details about Continuous Blog and my community efforts. My metrics for achieving these goals are largely based on web traffic to this blog and retweets via the @hudsonci twitter account. First a minor overview of some of Continuous Blog’s traffic, then I’ll get to reviewing the goals.\n\nVisitor trend via Google Analytics\n\nOver the past month Continuous Blog has seen just under 10,000 visits from a number of different sources, the top sources being:\n\nFeedburner links posted to @hudsonci\n\nDirect visits\n\nFeedburner\n\nReferrals from the \"blog\" link on hudson-ci.org\n\nreddit\n\nLinks from the Java.net community portal and associated weblogs\n\nIn addition to general web traffic, Continuous Blog has around 350 RSS subscribers.\n\nTo put these numbers into perspective, Hudson has seen commits from 173 different developers and the @hudsonci twitter account has about 1,100 followers.\n\nHudson Advocacy\n\nLooking at the traffic sources and the volume of traffic coming from what I would consider \"the wider internet community\" I’d say I failed to meet my own expectations. The majority of traffic seems to be coming from \"within the community\", which is certainly not a bad thing by a stretch, but I was hoping to start to see more visitors who are less likely to be using Hudson already. There are signs of this (I think) in the low number of search referrals, roughly 370 visits. To me this indicates the early age of this site, small number of external links to Continuous Blog and the content isn’t \"interesting\" enough to come up in searches for terms like \"continuous integration with python\".\n\nThe vector for improvement in advocacy, in my opinion, is to focus more on tutorials and user guides in the next month. Mike Rooney’s post on Keeping your configuration and data in Subversion was both discussion provoking, but one of the more visited pages over the past month. I’ll be reaching out to more power-users from differing backgrounds to try to get some more tutorials on using Hudson for Python, Ruby, and Cocoa development while continuing to bug some of you Maven2 pros about guides.\n\nCentral information repository\n\nI feel I failed to meet my own expectations here as well, it has only been a month (feels like an eternity!) so the amount of information we’ve been able to aggregate is small, but growing.\n\nI have likely spent too much time covering Hudson community news, which I feel is important, to put a human voice in front of commits and releases, but it is not what I originally intended to spend the majority of my time doing.\n\nRecognition of contributors\n\nIn my opinion, this goal I’ve met. When writing up each Hudson release I’ve made certain to give credit where credit is due, to those that contributed, Through the \"spotlight\" series of posts I’ve also made an effort to highlight power-users of Hudson, trying to glean interesting details about their installations from them for our benefit. Unfortunately I’ve done a poor job highlighting the contributions from individual plugin developers, something I’m still not certain how to correct.\n\nContent\n\nIf you’ve been following the blog you have no doubt noticed the regular occurrence of certain types of posts, these regular series are:\n\n\"This Week in Plugins\"\n\nThis post is halfway script generated, pulling all the release details out of SVN history to help me generate a post. The intention of the post being to cite new or notable plugins, while giving an informative listing of \"what’s happening\" in plugin development for the past week.\n\n\"Spotlight On\"\n\nThe only interview-formatted series I’ve got going right now, I’ve been trying to find companies or organizations who are using Hudson in interesting ways and are willing to let \"us\" peek behind the curtains a bit. This started more from curiosity, but I think it’s fun to let Hudson users brag about their set ups.\n\nHudson 1.xxx Released\n\nPretty straight-forward reporting on a release of Hudson, depending on the contents of the release there may be some calls to action or editorializing on what’s gone into the release.\n\nLinks for\n\nRoll-up of links shared or retweeted via the @hudsonci account, uncertain whether this is worth the time spent.\n\nMy two questions to the community in general would be:\n\nDo you dislike any of these?\n\nWhat else would you like to see on a regular basis?\n\nI’m certainly open to suggestion, I’d like Continuous Blog to continue to be interesting to the Hudson community and if certain kinds of posts are boring or uninteresting, I can cut them from the line-up.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe largest challenge of Continuous Blog is time. As it stands the majority of content I write or edit in some capacity, which is a larger amount of time than I expected to spend. All said and done it takes me between 6-10 hours a week to write for CB, keep tabs on @hudsonci and peruse the mailing list for interesting things. This probably isn’t maintainable, and if for some reason a bus hits me ( not uncommon around here), this blog would go dark for a while.\n\nThis can be easily fixed by simply adding more contributors to the blog, I’ll post more on how to write for Continuous Blog in another post.\n\nAll said and done, I am looking forward to another month of writing and following the Hudson community. I’m grateful for all those who’ve asked questions, been interviewed, wrote content and participated in discussion in the comments. For those of you in the Bay Area, I do hope you come out for the meet-up in mid-March, for the rest of you, I’ll catch you on IRC :)","title":"One month of Continuous Blog","tags":["core"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

One of Alan’s branches old-data-monitor was merged into trunk with r28147 bringing with it some changes to help migrate older plugin datasets to newer formats.\n\nWhen I reached out to Alan earlier today on IRC ( #hudson on the Freenode) about the subject he agreed that polling the community for beta testers would be a good idea; this is where you come in. Per Alan’s message to the dev@ mailing list:\n\nVisit your \"Manage Hudson\" screen to see if the notice about old/unreadable data appears. I’ll be curious to see which of the old deprecated data structures are actually out there in people’s XML files.\n\nInstead of waiting for the release candidate to be packaged Wednesday evening, I’ve gone ahead and published the artifact from build #4544 which can be downloaded here: hudson.war\n\nIf you have an old Hudson installation with, testing this build would be incredibly useful. Alan went on to say:\n\nIf people find issues with OldDataMonitor, they should file them at issues.hudson-ci.org in \"core\" component and assign them to \"mindless\".\n\nThis change does not mutate any data (or at least it shouldn’t) so it should be safe, be on the look out for exceptions in Hudson’s log on startup.","title":"Call for Testers: The older the better","tags":["development","core","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

This gives those of us in the Hudson development community a good sense of what’s really important to our users, which in turn helps us decide where to focus our efforts. If you’re interested, you can see the top voted issues over at our JIRA server.\n\nA good number of those issues have been high on the list for a while - I’m actually in the early stages of work on a plugin to answer HUDSON-682, the current #1 most voted-for issue, two and a half years after it was opened. But I’m sure there are some equally useful features Hudson users would like to see added which aren’t on that list. So I’m asking you, dear readers: what are you looking for in Hudson that isn’t already there? Take a look around the existing issues - you may find a request that fits what you want lurking just out of the top 10, needing only your vote to push it into the spotlight. If no one’s yet created an issue requesting your desired feature, well, create one.\n\nOr, better still, write a plugin or contribute a patch yourself!\n\nEditor’s Note: If you’re interested in writing a plugin, you can check out Hudson’s wiki and/or this guide on the subject.\n\nAndrew Bayer ( abayer) has been a contributor to Hudson since early 2009, contributing to the ClearCase plugin, Hudson’s core and a small number of other plugins.
