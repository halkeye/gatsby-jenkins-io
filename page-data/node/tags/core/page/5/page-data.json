Therefore it’s possible to have a bunch of them over the entire lifetime after the plugin installing the plugin.\n\nOn demand bundles: These bundles are generated from the root \"Support\" action.\n\nHowever current support-core plugin is not much user friendly. The object of this project is to make it more user friendly by adding some features which make a sophisticated environment for the user who use support plugin.\n\nIn this project scope, there are three features and improvements we are going to consider.\n\nEase the bundles management by the administrator ( JENKINS-33090)\n\nAdding an option to anonymize customer labels (strings created by the user such as name of a job, folder, view, agent, and template etc). ( JENKINS-33091)\n\nAllowing user to create an issue and submit a bundle into the OSS tracker using the support-core plugin. ( JENKINS-21670)\n\nArnaud Héritier and Steven Christou are guiding me through the project as my mentors.\n\nTasks and Deliverables\n\nEase the bundles management by the administrator.\n\nUnder this task, the following functions are going to be implemented.\n\nListing bundles stored on the jenkins instance with their details.\n\nAllowing user to download each bundle.\n\nAllowing user to delete each bundle or all bundles.\n\nAllowing user to browse the content of each bundle.\n\nAutomatically purging old bundles.\n\nEnabling user to create an issue and submit a bundle into the OSS tracker\n\nWhen a Jenkins user sees an issue, he/she commonly contacts his support contacts (Jenkins instance admins) and then Jenkins admins troubleshoot the issue.\nThe objective of this task is to implement a feature which enables the user to report an issue to a admin through support core plugin.\n\nWhen creating bundles to attach with the ticket, it is important to protect the privacy of the user who creates the ticket. When considering doing that, anonymizing user created labels (texts) comes to the front.\n\nAdding  an option to anonymize customer labels\n\nThe following functions will be implemented under this taks.\n\nCreating randomized tokens for labels created by users.\n\nProducing a mapping for those labels.\n\nSubstituting encoded labels into all the files included in the support bundle.\n\nWhen creating randomized tokens, it would be much useful and effective if we can create those tokens in a way they make sense to humans. (i.e. readable to humans). For that, I am hoping to use a suitable java library to create human friendly random tokens. One of such libraries is wordnet-random-name.\n\nHowever in order to substitute randomized tokens, all files included in the bundle should be read. This can become inefficient when bundle consists of large number of files.  Therefore it’s important to follow an optimized method for this task.\n\nReferences\n\nInitial proposal of the project\n\nProject repository","title":"GSoC Project Intro: Support Core Plugin Improvements","tags":["core","gsoc","plugin","support-core"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"minudika","html":"","id":"minudika","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Minudika Malshan","slug":"/blog/author/minudika","twitter":"minudika"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"4a650522-ee39-5465-887f-963c348a9754","slug":"/blog/2016/05/26/gsoc-jenkins-web-ui-project/","strippedHtml":"About me\n\nMy name is Samat Davletshin and I am from HSE University from Moscow, Russia. I\ninterned at Intel and Yandex, and cofounded a startup\nproject where I personally developed front-end and back-end of the website.\n\nI am excited to participate in GSoC with Jenkins this summer as a chanсe to make\na positive change for thousands of users as well as to learn from great mentors.\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough powerful, Jenkins new job creation and configuration process may be non\nobvious and time consuming. This can be improved by making UI more intuitive,\nconcise, and functional. I plan to achieve this by creating a simpler new job\ncreation, configuration process focused on essential elements, and embedding new\nfunctionality.\n\nMy mentors are Kirill Merkushev and\nMichael Neale\n\nDeliverables\n\nNew job creation\n\nNew job name validation\n\nInitially, job validation was unresponsive, job creation was still allowed with\nan invalid name, and some allowed characters even crashed Jenkins. Happily, two\nof this problems were fixed in recent improvements and I plan add only a real\ntime name check for invalid characters.\n\nPopup window\n\nJenkins has a lot of windows reloads that may time consuming. The creation of\nnew job is a simple process requiring only job name and job type. This way UI\nmay be improved by reducing page reloads and putting new job creation interface\nin a dialog window. Such popup would likely consist of three steps of\nimplementation: rendering a dialog window, receiving JSON with job types,\nsending a POST request to create the job.\n\nConfiguration page\n\nChanging help information\n\nAs reported by some users, it would be useful to have the functionality to\nchange help information. Installation administrators would be able to change the\nhelp info and choose editing rights for other users. That would likely require a\ncreation of extension points and a plugin using them. I also would like to\ninclude the ability to style the help information using markdown as shown above.\n\n[Optional] The functionality is extended to creation of crowd sourced \"wiki like\" documentation\n\nAs in\nlocalization\nplugin the changes are gathered and applied beyond installation of a particular\nuser.\n\nMore intuitive configuration page.\n\nPursuing to solve this  issue\n\nAlthough there are a lot improvements in new configuration page, there is always\na room for improvements. An advanced job still has a very complicated and hard\nto read configuration page. It is still open to discussion, but I may approach\nit by better division of configuration parts such as an accordion based\nnavigation.\n\nHome page\n\n[Optional] Removing \"My Views\" page\n\n\"My Views\" page may unnecessary complicate essential sidepanel navigation. Since\nit contains very small functionality, the functions may be moved to the home\npage and the whole page may be removed. That may be implemented by adding icons\nto \"My Views\" tabs. Additionally, the standard view creation page can create\neither of the types\n\n[Optional] Reducing number of UI elements\n\nThe home page may contain some UI elements that are not essential and rarely\nused. This way elements \"enable auto refresh\", “edit description”, “icon sizes”,\n”legend”, “RSS” may be removed from home page and placed under \"Manage Jenkins\"\nor an upper menu. It is also possible to create new extension points to support\nnew UI elements through plugins.\n\nCredentials store page\n\n[Optional] Grouping credentials and their domains\n\nCredentials page has too many reloads and requires many clicks to get to a\nrequired credentials page. That may be improved by removing the last page and\nshowing credentials under domains.\n\nCurrent progress\n\nBy May 25th I learned about the structure and tools of Jenkins and started\nworking on the first project:\n\nI started with New Job Name validation first. Luckily, in last updates the\nchanges of recena there\nwere implemented all of the changes I proposed except real time check on name\nvalidity. Here I proposed the change which fixes it by\nsending GET request on keyup event in addition to blur.\n\nI also made a New Job Popup with using existing interface.\n\nView the current\npop-up progress\n\nI used Remodal library for popup and put\nthere\nexisting\nNew Job container. Surprisingly, it was fully functional right away. On the GIF\nyou can see that popup receives all job types and then successfully submits the\npost form creating a new job. I think that could be a good first step. Further I\ncan start changing the window itself.\n\nLinks\n\nInitial proposal of the project\n\nThe project discussion on mailing list\n\nJenkins GSoC Page\n\nProject repository","title":"GSoC Project Intro: Improving Job Creation/Configuration","tags":["core","gsoc"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"samatdav","html":"","id":"samatdav","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Samat Davletshin","slug":"/blog/author/samatdav","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3bdee89e-566b-52d9-a3cc-f41507becadc","slug":"/blog/2016/05/25/update-plugin-for-pipeline/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Chris Price.\nChris is a software engineer at Puppet, and has been\nspending some time lately on automating performance testing using the latest\nJenkins features.\n\nIn this blog post, I’m going to attempt to provide some step-by-step notes on\nhow to refactor an existing Jenkins plugin to make it compatible with the new\nJenkins Pipeline jobs.  Before we get to the fun stuff, though, a little\nbackground.\n\nHow’d I end up here?\n\nRecently, I started working on a project to automate some performance tests for\nmy company’s products.  We use the awesome Gatling load\ntesting tool for these tests, but we’ve largely been handling the testing very\nmanually to date, due to a lack of bandwidth to get them automated in a clean,\nmaintainable, extensible way.  We have a years-old Jenkins server where we use\nthe gatling jenkins\nplugin to track the\nhistory of certain tests over time, but the setup of the Jenkins instance was\nvery delicate and not easy to reproduce, so it had fallen into a state of\ndisrepair.\n\nOver the last few days I’ve been putting some effort into getting things more\nautomated and repeatable so that we can really maximize the value that we’re\ngetting out of the performance tests.  With some encouragement from the fine\nfolks in the #jenkins IRC channel, I ended up exploring\nthe JobDSL\nplugin and the new Pipeline jobs.  Combining those two\nthings with some Puppet code to provision a Jenkins server via the\njenkins puppet module gave me\na really nice way to completely automate my Jenkins setup and get a seed job in\nplace that would create my perf testing jobs.  And the Pipeline job format is\njust an awesome fit for what I wanted to do in terms of being able to easily\nmonitor the stages of my performance tests, and to make the job definitions\nmodular so that it would be really easy to create new performance testing jobs\nwith slight variations.\n\nSo everything’s going GREAT up to this point.  I’m really happy with how it’s\nall shaping up.  But then…​ (you knew there was a \"but\" coming, right?) I\nstarted trying to figure out how to add the\nGatling Jenkins\nplugin to the Pipeline jobs, and kind of ran into a wall.\n\nAs best as I could tell from my Googling, the plugin was probably going to\nrequire some modifications in order to be able to be used with Pipeline jobs.\nHowever, I wasn’t able to find any really cohesive documentation that\ndefinitively confirmed that or explained how everything fits together.\n\nEventually, I got it all sorted out.  So, in hopes of saving the next person a\nlittle time, and encouraging plugin authors to invest the time to get their\nplugins working with Pipeline, here are some notes about what I learned.\n\nSpoiler: if you’re just interested in looking at the individual git commits that\nI made on may way to getting the plugin working with Pipeline, have a look at\nthis github\nbranch.\n\nCreating a pipeline step\n\nThe main task that the Gatling plugin performs is to archive Gatling reports\nafter a run.  I figured that the end game for this exercise was that I was going\nto end up with a Pipeline \"step\" that I could include in my Pipeline scripts, to\ntrigger the archiving of the reports.  So my first thought was to look for an\nexisting plugin / Pipeline \"step\" that was doing something roughly similar, so\nthat I could use it as a model.  The Pipeline \"Snippet Generator\" feature\n(create a pipeline job, scroll down to the \"Definition\" section of its\nconfiguration, and check the \"Snippet Generator\" checkbox) is really helpful for\nfiguring out stuff like this; it is automatically populated with all of the\nsteps that are valid on your server (based on which plugins you have installed),\nso you can use it to verify whether or not your custom \"step\" is recognized, and\nalso to look at examples of existing steps.\n\nLooking through the list of existing steps, I figured that the archive step\nwas pretty likely to be similar to what I needed for the gatling plugin:\n\nSo, I started poking around to see what magic it was that made that archive\nstep show up there.  There are some mentions of this in the\npipeline-plugin\nDEVGUIDE.md and the\nworkflow-step-api-plugin\nREADME.md, but the real breakthrough for me was finding the definition of the\narchive step in the workflow-basic-steps-plugin source\ncode.\n\nWith that as an example, I was able to start poking at getting a\ngatlingArchive step to show up in the Snippet Generator.  The first thing that\nI needed to do was to update the gatling-plugin project’s pom.xml to depend\non a recent enough version of Jenkins, as well as specify dependencies on the\nappropriate pipeline\nplugins\n\nOnce that was out of the way, I noticed that the archive step had some tests\nwritten for it, using what looks to be a pretty awesome test API for pipeline\njobs and plugins.  Based on those archive\ntests,\nI added\na\nskeleton for a test for the gatlingArchive step that I was about to write.\n\nThen, I moved on to\nactually\ncreating the step.  The meat of the code was this:\n\npublic class GatlingArchiverStep extends AbstractStepImpl {\n    @DataBoundConstructor\n    public GatlingArchiverStep() {}\n\n    @Extension\n    public static class DescriptorImpl extends AbstractStepDescriptorImpl {\n        public DescriptorImpl() { super(GatlingArchiverStepExecution.class); }\n\n        @Override\n        public String getFunctionName() {\n            return \"gatlingArchive\";\n        }\n\n        @NonNull\n        @Override\n        public String getDisplayName() {\n            return \"Archive Gatling reports\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNote that in that commit I also added a config.jelly file.  This is how you\ndefine the UI for your step, which will show up in the Snippet Generator.  In\nthe case of this Gatling step there’s really not much to configure, so my\nconfig.jelly is basically empty.\n\nWith that (and the rest of the code from that commit) in place, I was able to\nfire up the development Jenkins server (via mvn hpi:run, and note that you\nneed to go into the \"Manage Plugins\" screen on your development server and\ninstall the Pipeline plugin once before any of this will work) and visit the\nSnippet Generator to see if my step showed up in the dropdown:\n\nGREAT SUCCESS!\n\nThis step doesn’t actually do anything yet, but it’s recognized by Jenkins and\ncan be included in your pipeline scripts at that point, so, we’re on our way!\n\nThe step metastep\n\nThe step that we created above is a first-class DSL addition that can be used in\nPipeline scripts.  There’s another way to make your plugin work usable from a\nPipeline job, without making it a first-class build step.  This is by use of the\nstep\"metastep\", mentioned in the pipeline-plugin\nDEVGUIDE.\nWhen using this approach, you simply refactor your Builder or Publisher to\nextend SimpleBuildStep, and then you can reference the build step from the\nPipeline DSL using the step method.\n\nIn the Jenkins GUI, go to the config screen for a Pipeline job and click on the\nSnippet Generator checkbox.  Select 'step: General Build Step' from the\ndropdown, and then have a look at the options that appear in the 'Build Step'\ndropdown.  To compare with our previous work, let’s see what \"Archive the\nartifacts\" looks like:\n\nFrom the snippet generator we can see that it’s possible to trigger an Archive\naction with syntax like:\n\nstep([$class: 'ArtifactArchiver', artifacts: 'foo*', excludes: null])\n\nThis is the \"metastep\".  It’s a way to trigger any build action that implements\nSimpleBuildStep, without having to actually implement a real \"step\" that\nextends the Pipeline DSL like we did above.  In many cases, it might only make\nsense to do one or the other in your plugin; you probably don’t really need\nboth.\n\nFor the purposes of this tutorial, we’re going to do both.  For a couple of reasons:\n\nWhy the heck not?  :)  It’s a good demonstration of how the metastep stuff\nworks.\n\nBecause implementing the \"for realz\" step will be a lot easier if the Gatling\naction that we’re trying to call from our gatlingArchive() syntax is using the\nnewer Jenkins APIs that are required for subclasses of SimpleBuildStep.\n\nGatlingPublisher is the main build action that we’re interested in using in\nPipeline jobs.  So, with all of that in mind, here’s our next goal: get\nstep([$class: 'GatlingPublisher', …​) showing up in the Snippet Generator.\n\nThe javadocs for the SimpleBuildStep\nclass\nhave some notes on what you need to do when porting an existing Builder or\nPublisher over to implement the SimpleBuildStep interface.  In all\nlikelihood, most of what you’re going to end up doing is to replace occurrences\nof AbstractBuild with references to the Run class, and replace occurrences\nof AbstractProject with references to the Job class.  The APIs are pretty\nsimilar, so it’s not too hard to do once you understand that that’s the game.\nThere is some discussion of this in the pipeline-plugin\nDEVGUIDE.\n\nFor the Gatling plugin, my\ninitial\nefforts to port the GatlingPublisher over to implement SimpleBuildStep only\nrequired the AbstractBuild → Run refactor.\n\nAfter making these changes, I fired up the development Jenkins server, and, voila!\n\nSo, now, we can add a line like this to a Pipeline build script:\n\nstep([$class: 'GatlingPublisher', enabled: true])\n\nAnd it’ll effectively be the same as if we’d added the Gatling \"Post-Build\nAction\" to an old-school Freestyle project.\n\nWell…​ mostly.\n\nBuild Actions vs. Project Actions\n\nAt this point our modified Gatling plugin should work the same way as it always\ndid in a Freestyle build, but in a Pipeline build, it only partially works.\nSpecifically, the Gatling plugin implements two different \"Actions\" to surface\nthings in the Jenkins GUI: a \"Build\" action, which adds the Gatling icon to the\nleft sidebar in the GUI when you’re viewing an individual build in the build\nhistory of a job, and a \"Project\" action, which adds that same icon to the left\nsidebar of the GUI of the main page for a job.  The \"Project\" action also adds a\n\"floating panel\" on the main job page, which shows a graph of the historical\ndata for the Gatling runs.\n\nIn a Pipeline job, though, assuming we’ve added a call to the metastep, we’re\nonly seeing the \"Build\" actions.  Part of this is because, in the last round of\nchanges that I linked, we only modified the \"Build\" action, and not the\n\"Project\" action.  Running the metastep in a Pipeline job has no visible effect\nat all on the project/job page at this point.  So that’s what we’ll tackle next.\n\nThe key thing to know about getting \"Project\" actions working in a Pipeline job\nis that, with a Pipeline job, there is no way for Jenkins to know up front what\nsteps or actions are going to be involved in a job.  It’s only after the job\nruns once that Jenkins has a chance to introspect what all the steps were.  As\nsuch, there’s no list of Builders or Publishers that it knows about up front to\ncall getProjectAction on, like it would with a Freestyle job.\n\nThis is where\nSimpleBuildStep.LastBuildAction\ncomes into play.  This is an interface that you can add to your Build actions,\nwhich give them their own getProjectActions method that Jenkins recognizes and\nwill call when rendering the project page after the job has been run at least\nonce.\n\nSo, effectively, what we need to do is to\nget\nrid of the getProjectAction method on our Publisher class, modify the Build\naction to implement SimpleBuildStep.LastBuildAction, and encapsulate our\nProject action instances in the Build action.\n\nThe build action class now constructs an instance of the Project action and\nmakes it accessible via getProjectActions (which comes from the\nLastBuildAction interface):\n\npublic class GatlingBuildAction implements Action, SimpleBuildStep.LastBuildAction {\n    public GatlingBuildAction(Run build, List sims) {\n        this.build = build;\n        this.simulations = sims;\n\n        List projectActions = new ArrayList<>();\n        projectActions.add(new GatlingProjectAction(build.getParent()));\n        this.projectActions = projectActions;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Collection getProjectActions() {\n        return this.projectActions;\n    }\n}\n\nAfter making these changes, if we run the development Jenkins server, we can see\nthat after the first successful run of the Pipeline job that calls the\nGatlingPublisher metastep, the Gatling icon indeed shows up in the sidebar on\nthe main project page, and the floating box with the graph shows up as well:\n\nMaking our DSL step do something\n\nSo at this point we’ve got the metastep syntax working from end-to-end, and\nwe’ve got a valid Pipeline DSL step ( gatlingArchive()) that we can use in our\nPipeline scripts without breaking anything…​ but our custom step doesn’t\nactually do anything.  Here’s the part where we tie it all together…​ and it’s\npretty easy!  All we need to do is to make our step \"Execution\" class\ninstantiate a Publisher and call perform on\nit.\n\nAs per the\nnotes\nin the pipeline-plugin DEVGUIDE, we can use the @StepContextParameter\nannotation to inject in the objects that we need to pass to the Publisher’s\nperform method:\n\npublic class GatlingArchiverStepExecution extends AbstractSynchronousNonBlockingStepExecution {\n\n    @StepContextParameter\n    private transient TaskListener listener;\n\n    @StepContextParameter\n    private transient FilePath ws;\n\n    @StepContextParameter\n    private transient Run build;\n\n    @StepContextParameter\n    private transient Launcher launcher;\n\n    @Override\n    protected Void run() throws Exception {\n        listener.getLogger().println(\"Running Gatling archiver step.\");\n\n        GatlingPublisher publisher = new GatlingPublisher(true);\n        publisher.perform(build, ws, launcher, listener);\n\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n\nAfter these changes, we can fire up the development Jenkins server, and hack up\nour Pipeline script to call gatlingArchive() instead of the metastep\nstep([$class: 'GatlingPublisher', enabled: true]) syntax.  One of these is\nnicer to type and read than the other, but I’ll leave that as an exercise for\nthe reader.\n\nFin\n\nWith that, our plugin now works just as well in the brave new Pipeline world as\nit did in the olden days of Freestyle builds.  I hope these notes save someone\nelse a little bit of time and googling on your way to writing (or porting) an\nawesome plugin for Jenkins Pipeline jobs!\n\nLinks\n\nJenkins Pipeline Overview\n\nPipeline Plugin Developer Guide\n\nJenkins Source Code\n\nWorkflow Step API Plugin\n\nWorkflow Basic Steps Plugin","title":"Refactoring a Jenkins plugin for compatibility with Pipeline jobs","tags":["core","pipeline","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"cprice404","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Chris is a software engineer at Puppet, who mostly works on backend services\nfor Puppet itself, but occasionally gets to spend some time improving CI\nand automation using Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"cprice404","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Chris Price","slug":"/blog/author/cprice404","twitter":"cprice404"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"31e502bf-b2a2-58e7-aec8-26b504df7584","slug":"/blog/2016/05/11/security-update/","strippedHtml":"We just released security updates to Jenkins that fix a number of low and medium severity issues. For an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\n\nOne of the fixes may well break some of your use cases in Jenkins, at least until plugins have been adapted: SECURITY-170. This change removes parameters that are not defined on a job from the build environment. So, right now, a job could even be unparameterized, and plugins were able to pass parameters anyway. Since build parameters are added to the environment variables of scripts run during a build, parameters such as PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH can be defined — on jobs which don’t even expect those as build parameters — to change the behavior of builds.\n\nA number of plugins define additional parameters for builds. For example, GitHub Pull Request Builder passes a number of additional parameters describing the pull request. Release Plugin also allows adding several additional parameters to a build that are not considered to be defined in the job as part of this security fix.\n\nPlease see this wiki page for a list of plugins known to be affected by this change.\n\nUntil these plugins have been adapted to work with the new restriction (and advice on that is available further down), you can define the following system properties to work around this limitation, at least for a time:\n\nSet hudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters to true, e.g. java -Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters=true -jar jenkins.war to revert to the old behavior of allowing any build parameters. Depending on your environment, this may be unsafe, as it opens you up to attacks as described above.\n\nSet hudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters to a comma-separated list of safe parameter names, e.g. java -Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=FOO,BAR_baz,quX -jar jenkins.war.\n\nI realize this change, among a few others that improve the security of Jenkins, may be difficult to adapt for some, but given the valuable secrets typically stored in Jenkins, I’m certain that this is the correct approach. We made sure to release this fix with the options described above, so that this change doesn’t block updating those that rely on this behavior.\n\nDevelopers have several options to adapt to this change:\n\nParametersAction actually stores all parameters, but getParameters() only returns those that are defined on the job. The new method getAllParameters() returns all of them. This can be used, for example by EnvironmentContributor extensions, to add known safe parameters to build environments.\n\nDon’t pass extra arguments, but define a QueueAction for your metadata instead. Those can still be made available to the build environment as needed.\n\nSubscribe to the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list to receive important notifications related to Jenkins security.","title":"Security updates for Jenkins core","tags":["core","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and, as security officer, leads the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/author/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-02-29T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ae0d63e1-b43b-5b6d-8c92-24abb7eb3f56","slug":"/blog/2016/02/29/jenkins2-alphas/","strippedHtml":"After first\nannouncing the\nJenkins 2.0 effort last fall, we are pleased to announce the availability of\nthe first Jenkins 2.0 alpha builds.
