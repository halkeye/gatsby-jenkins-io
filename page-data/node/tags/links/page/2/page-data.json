If the problem persists next week, I’ll find a better way to dig up information on particularly releases that doesn’t depend on the GitHub mirror.\n\nBugs fixed\n\nTagging a repository can result in NPE.\n\nFix possible form submission error when using multiple combobox elements.

Bundled with this release was another localizations drop including translations for ca, es, fi, fr, hi_IN, it, nl, ru, and sv_SE locales. In addition to the nice fancy new community contributed translations, which you can help with by installing the Translation Assistance plugin, the 1.352 release includes the subtle enhancement of hyperlinking URLs in the console output.\n\nIn general, 1.352 is looking like a very solid release, that said, here’s the breakdown for this release:\n\nBugs fixed\n\nFixed a file handle leak when a copy fails. ( issue 5899)\n\nReplace '>' with '_' in username, as already done for '<'. ( issue 5833)\n\nFix editableComboBox to select item when mouse click takes more than 100ms. ( issue 2722)\n\nFixed NPE when configuring a view without \"Regular expression\".\n\nPage shouldn’t scroll up when the user opens/closes a stack trace in the test failure report.\n\nFixed a bug where Hudson can put a wrong help file link. ( report)\n\nFixed Maven site goal archiving from agents. ( issue 5943)\n\nFixed a regression with NetBeans Hudson plugin progressive console output. ( issue 5941)\n\nFixed a situation where a failure in plugin start up can prevent massive number of job loss.\n\nEnhancements\n\nSupported JBoss EAP 5.0.0 GA. ( issue 5922)\n\nCLI commands on protected Hudson now asks a password interactively, if run on Java6.\n\nAdded CLI 'login' and 'logout' commands so that you don’t have to specify a credential for individual CLI invocation.\n\nURLs in the console output are now hyperlinks.\n\nImproved the URL annotation logic.\n\nAdd drag&drop support for f:repeatable lists and use this for the JDK/Ant/Maven installations in global config so these can be reordered.\n\nIntegrated a new round of community-contributed localizations (ca, es, fi, fr, hi_IN, it, nl, ru, and sv_SE locales.)\n\nContributors\n\nThis release contains 63 commits, from six different contributors including our very own Subversion-loving Mike Rooney (mcrooney).\n\nabayer\n\njglick\n\nkohsuke\n\nmcrooney\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.352 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Of particular interest to users of Hudson’s various native packages for Red Hat, openSuSE, Ubuntu/Debian and Solaris, was a change that suppress the \"self-upgrade\" functionality in the \"Manage Hudson\" page. On the enhancements side of the fence, the team added authentication support to the Hudson CLI ( issue 3796) allowing Hudson users with locked down installations to take advantage of everything the CLI has to offer.\n\nInternal to Hudson, some more changes from Alan Harder (a.k.a mindless, a.k.a The Garbage Man), deprecating or otherwise removing deprecated APIs. Alan’s been doing some great work on Hudson’s internals, if you’re coming out to this weekend’s hackathon, but sure to pat him on the back for his tireless efforts.\n\nBug fixes\n\nFix handling of relative paths in alternate settings.xml path for Maven projects. ( issue 4693)\n\nAlternate settings, private repository, profiles, etc were not used in embedded Maven for deploy publisher. ( issue 4939)\n\nMake editableComboBox work in repeatable content, such as a build step.\n\nIf content is captured using ..content.. , fixed this to use proper HTML rendering when appropriate.\n\n'<' and '&' in the console output was not escaped since 1.349 ( issue 5852)\n\nFixed an AbstractMethodError in SCM polling under some circumstances.

There were however some notable commits in this release cycle that didn’t make the changelog just yet, for example https://twitter.com/ godin [godin] committed an ebuild which will allow for a native package of Hudson for Gentoo Linux, joining the ranks of the existing packages for Debian/Ubuntu, FreeBSD, OpenSolaris, openSUSE and RedHat/Fedora Linux. The bundled Subversion plugin was updated and thanks to sogabe and wyukawa the Japanese translations for Hudson got some updates as well.\n\nFor Hudson developers, both plugin and core, this release contains some notable changes from mindless (a.k.a Alan Harder), a number of calls which have been deprecated for over two years have finally been pruned from the code base:\n\nHudson.addListener(JobListener), Hudson.removeListener(JobListener)\n\nEntire listeners.JobListener class (replaced by ItemListener)\n\nOne form of DirectoryBrowser constructor\n\nOne form of Descriptor.configure() (with HttpServletRequest param)\n\nDescriptor.convert(Map) and 4 implementations of this method, and code calling it in Descriptor.readResolve() (this code called save() whenever updating data, so there should be no remaining cases out there)\n\nAlan’s quest for removing deprecated code will likely continue for a while, but this is a good step in the right direction, keeping Hudson’s internals in good working order. Worth mentioning, the influx of plugin releases in the This Week in Plugins from a couple weeks ago, was driven largely by Alan, rummaging through the code of older plugins, updating plugins left and right.\nNow the breakdown for this release:\n\nBugs fixed\n\nFix javascript problem showing test failure detail for test name with a quote character. ( issue 1544)\n\nHudson can incorrectly configure labels for the controller when bleeding edge EC2 plugin is used.\n\nFixed the regression wrt the whitespace trimming caused by 1.346. ( issue 5633)\n\nUnder some circumstances, Hudson can incorrectly delete the temporary directory itself. ( issue 5642)\n\nNewlines in MAVEN_OPTS environment variable can cause problems in other contexts. ( issue 5651)\n\nEnhancements\n\nImproved the form validation mechanism to support multiple controls. ( issue 5610)\n\nAdded message to agent log when it has successfully come online.

Similar to the past couple releases, 1.346 had a good number of bug fixes, including a a performance fix when dealing with larger build submissions and a substantial revision of the SCM polling code to fix a long-standing issue with the quiet period blocking the build from running ( issue 2180), there were also some additionally memory improvements made to Jelly, the library with which the majority of Hudson’s web interface is rendered, that Kohsuke will detail in a later post.\n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n\nBugs fixed\n\nMaven modules should not be buildable when the parent project is disabled. ( issue 1375)\n\nFixed the broken quiet period implementation when polling interval is shorter than the quiet period. (Changes in SCM impls are needed for this to take effect.) ( issue 2180)\n\nEscape username in URLs in case it contains special characters such as \"#\". ( issue 2610)\n\nFix sidepanel link for People to be visible and show view-specific info when appropriate. ( issue 5443)\n\nImproved HTML rendering, not using closing tags that do not exist in HTML. ( issue 5458)\n\nShow better error message for missing view type selection when creating a view. ( issue 5469)\n\nHudson wasn’t properly streaming a large external build submission, which can result in OOME and unresponsiveness.\n# Enhancements\n\nUse fixed-width font in text area for shell/batch build steps. ( issue 5471)\n\nUse user selected icon size on People page. ( issue 5447)\n\nSpeed/footprint improvement in the HTML rendering.\n\n# Contributors This release of Hudson contained 37 commits from 3 different contributors to \"core\": * kohsuke * mindless * sogabe\nAs usual, you can go grab the [latest .war file]( http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war) straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade. ---- Updated: Added the \"official\" changelog notes","title":"Hudson 1.346 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
