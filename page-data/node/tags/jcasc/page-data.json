Updating the jenkins.yaml file\n\nReload the existing configuration to apply the system message change\n\nNow, go back to the Dashboard and you can see the updated System Message on top:\n\nFigure 2. Viewing the changes on Dashboard\n\nThis file will be used later to configure the plugin using JCasC.\n\nConfigure the plugin on the UI\n\nFor this demo, install the View Job Filters plugin.\n\nLet’s create a view by clicking on the New View option on the left side of the Dashboard.\n\nGive it a name (say, “testView”) and set its type to List View, and click on the OK button.\n\nFigure 3. Creating the View\n\nNow click on Add Job Filter to add any kind of filter, so let’s select Build Duration Filter and fill the field with any value (say, \"60\" minutes),\n\nFigure 4. Adding filter to the view\n\nClick on Apply Save.\n\nTo view the full configuration, check out your main jenkins.yaml configuration file, by clicking on Manage Jenkins Configuration as Code View Configuration\n\nGo to the views section in this YAML file to see details related to the view,\n\nFigure 5. Here, details regarding the view (which we just created) is visible\n\nDownload the Configuration\n\nNow that you have successfully configured your plugin by UI, let’s download the configuration by going to Manage Jenkins on the Dashboard, then click on Configuration as Code under \"System Configuration\".\n\nNow click on the Download Configuration button to save the configuration file locally.\n\nFigure 6. Downloading the Configuration\n\nUpdate JCasC file locally\n\nAdd some changes in your downloaded copy of the jenkins.yaml file, to see those changes being automatically reflected on the UI.\n\nFor demo purposes, let’s change the name to “YoutubeDemoView” and set the buildDurationMinutes as \"55\".\n\nFigure 7. Changing the View details locally\n\nSave the file.\n\nLoad the jenkins.yaml file on the Jenkins server\n\nNow to reflect the local changes done in the jenkins.yaml file onto the Jenkins server, click on the Reload existing configuration button.\n\nFigure 8. Applying the New Configuration to the Jenkins instance\n\nVerify the changes on the UI\n\nGo back to the main page by clicking on the Jenkins logo on the top-left side.\n\nAnd you will notice that the name of your view has been changed from \"testView\" to “YoutubeDemoView”,\n\nAnd the field value of Build Duration Filter has been changed from \"60\" to “55”.\n\nThese two are the exact changes that we did locally in our jenkins.yaml file.\n\nFigure 9. Verifying the changes\n\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully configured a plugin (“View Job Filter”) automatically with the help of the “Jenkins Configuration as Code” plugin! You can repeat the same process for other plugins as well.","title":"Configure Plugins with JCasC","tags":["jcasc","tutorial","plugins","yaml"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#586868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/55658/dheerajodha.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/3af71/dheerajodha.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/226ae/dheerajodha.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/55658/dheerajodha.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/3dc24/dheerajodha.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/bf13b/dheerajodha.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/12101/dheerajodha.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/e9db2/dheerajodha.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/7f342743d9a8f15cb84f0a2630efe0c5/6fafe/dheerajodha.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":145}}},"blog":null,"github":"dheerajodha","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Dheeraj is a Computer Science Engineering student (senior) at Vivekanand Institute of Technology, University of Mumbai.

One of the reasons it continues to be so ubiquitous is that Jenkins constantly evolves and offers flexibility to integrate other tools that work well for your solution.\n\nAt CDCon, on October 7-8, there are two particular Jenkins talks that will focus on new directions that the Jenkins platform is evolving too and getting better and better for users.\n\nHeard of JCasC and Not Sure Where to Start? Let me Help You!\n\nConfiguration as code is a best practice for your CI/CD setup as it makes the complex process of setting up Jenkins simpler and more reproducible. Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasc) enables Jenkins users to define the whole configuration as a simple, plain text YAML syntax. With JCasc, setting up a new Jenkins controller is easier than ever before. To get started with JCasC some initial effort is required. This talk walks you through a basic setup for easily spinning up new Jenkins instances.\n\nOctober 7 at 2:20 PM PST\nSpeaker: Ewelina Wilkosz, Eficode\n\nEwelina W is passionate about making sure that her customers' software is being built, tested and released in the best possible way. And, most importantly, that software developers don’t hate the process. Ewelina has been involved in Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin development from the very beginning. This is a must-see talk where Ewelina will also share some tips and tricks. The talk will feature using Docker, Jenkins and GitHub Actions as a quick way to build… Jenkins!\n\nBridging the Gap with Tekton-client-plugin for Jenkins\n\nTekton provides Kubernetes-native CI/CD building blocks. It enables users to take full advantage of cloud-native features around scalability and high availability. Jenkins flexibility enables integration with Tekton. This talk showcases the new tekton-client-plugin for Jenkins that enables Jenkins to interact with Tekton pipelines on a Kubernetes cluster. Tekton and Jenkins are both CDF projects and this talk highlights the first steps towards better Tekton and Jenkins interoperability, a key goal of the CD Foundation.\n\nOctober 7 at 11:40 AM PST\nSpeaker: Vibhav Bobade, Red Hat\n\nRegister for CDCon\n\nBoth these talks showcase the ultimate flexibility and power of the Jenkins platform and how it continues to evolve to meet the challenges of modern-day CI/CD. Don’t miss out; register for CDCon to attend.\n\nCDCon has pledged to donate 100% of the proceeds received from CDCon 2020 registration to charitable causes: Black Girls Code, Women Who Code and the CDF Diversity Fund. Registrants indicate which charitable fund they want their 25 USD registration fees to go to during registration. If you can’t afford the registration cost, please apply for the diversity scholarship.","title":"Learn more about Jenkins' continuous evolution at CDCon","tags":["cdcon","talks","jcasc","cicd","tekton"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/4ea1f/cdfoundation.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/b8799/cdfoundation.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/c15a4/cdfoundation.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/4ea1f/cdfoundation.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/d4baf/cdfoundation.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/c9eb6/cdfoundation.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/5f6e9/cdfoundation.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/b881c/cdfoundation.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/afc7435059ce92f0d58e1a8086d9e05d/3f20b/cdfoundation.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":122}}},"blog":"https://cd.foundation/news/blog/","github":"cdfoundation","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) serves as the vendor-neutral home of many of the fastest-growing projects for continuous delivery, including Jenkins, Jenkins X, Spinnaker, and Tekton.\nCDF supports DevOps practitioners with an open model, training, industry guidelines, and a portability focus.</p>\n</div>","id":"cdfoundation","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Continuous Delivery Foundation","slug":"/blog/authors/cdfoundation","twitter":"cdeliveryfdn"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","id":"edd1abcd-b413-5696-b610-a81a6a7fdd9f","slug":"/blog/2018/08/29/day-of-jenkins-and-other-chances-to-meet-jcasc/","strippedHtml":"The Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin is reaching a stage when it is almost ready to be used in a production environment.\nAs a matter of fact, I know some living-on-the-edge users are already doing that.\nThe first release candidates are out and the official 1.0 is just around the corner.\n\nI’d like to use this chance to invite you to meet us and contribute to the plugin.\nThere will be plenty of opportunities this autumn.\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code (also called \"JCasC\") is a Jenkins plugin that allows you to store and maintain all your Jenkins configuration in yaml file.\nIt’s like Pipeline or Job DSL but for managing Jenkins.\n\nIn one of my blogposts,\nJenkins Configuration as Code - Automating an automation server,\nI provide a longer explanation of the plugin, and answer questions like\n“why did we decided to develop it?” and “why you may want to use it?”.\nI recommend you to read that one if you’re not familiar with the project yet.\n\nThe plugin has been presented at a number of meetups - by me but also other contributors.\nThis is the first open source project that I’ve actively participated in and I’m quite shocked - positively - to see how many people decided to join the effort and actively develop the plugin with us.\nNow it’s time to take it to the bigger stage and broader audience.\nSo together with Nicolas de Loof I’m gonna present the plugin at DevOps World | Jenkins World in San Francisco (19th of September)  and in Nice (24th of October) - yes, Jenkins World is coming to Europe.\n\nBut that’s not all!\nPraqma - the company I work for -\nhas organised a number of “Day of Jenkins” events around Scandinavia in past years.\nThis October they have decided to bring the events back with a theme: Day of Jenkins 2018 is\nDay of Jenkins [as code] .\nIt’s a two track one day event with presentations and hands-on sessions for users and a hackathon for contributors -
