is the world’s leading open-source automation server used by companies large and small around the globe to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery.\nKubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.\nKubernetes is compatible with the majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests, deploy builds in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.\nOne of the most popular CI/CD tools now is Jenkins thereby making Jenkins on Kubernetes a popular theme for Jenkins users.\n\nDuring the Google Season Of Docs program, I worked with the Jenkins organization on the project - Document Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nThe original proposal for this project can be found here.\n\nProject Goals\n\nAfter my proposal was accepted by the Jenkins organization, my mentors and I agreed on the expectations for the Google Season of Docs project.\nThe goal of this project was to create a new Kubernetes Volume which would describe the concepts, techniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins thereby providing the following advantages:\n\nImprove the user experience of Jenkins on Kubernetes users by giving them a one-stop-shop for information on Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nMake it easy to track, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nReference the existing community documentation for Jenkins on K8s (plugins and tools/integrations).\n\nHow to guides, tutorials and explanations of concepts and techniques in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nJust-In-Time documentation which means that rather than documenting every feature comprehensively, we produce and release documentation in bits but continuously based on popular questions, feedback and area of interests gathered from the community and users.\n\nCommunity Bonding: Planning the solution\n\nFind below an outline of my activities during the community bonding phase:\n\nSetting up communication channels: meetings, mailings, chats: My mentors and I agreed on the right time and channel for communication due to time difference.\nWe agreed to meet twice weekly, on Mondays and Thursdays at 7:00 PM GMT +1 and use Jenkins documentation gitter channel for other communications.\n\nContacting Stakeholders and onboarding contributors: The project was  announced on social media and different Jenkins channels.\nI wrote a blog post to announce the project and created a project page on Jenkins.io.\n\nKnowledge transfer: I and my mentors planned knowledge sharing sessions and fixed tentative dates based on the availability of the trainers.\nMy mentors also shared useful resources to help me prepare for the project.\n\nGetting permissions: I and my mentors agreed I didn’t need any special permissions from the beginning, however, this topic was left open for discussion if the need arose later on in the project.\n\nPre-planning of the project: I refined my goals and set expectations with my mentor and also learned more about the community(Jenkins).\nI also had to ensure that the proposed documentation structure I drafted was in line with the goals of the organization so my mentors vetted it and we finalized on the proposed sections that I was supposed to work on.\n\nDocumentation Development Phase\n\nKnowledge Sharing Sessions\n\nDuring the development phase, my mentors hosted two knowledge sharing sessions:\n\nKatacoda and Helm by Marky Jackson\n\nSee the slides\n\nHelm by Torsten Walter\n\nSee the slides\n\nThese sessions gave me an in-depth understanding of concepts and tools needed for the project.\n\nJenkins on Kubernetes Documentation Skeleton\n\nAt the application phase, I drafted a structure describing the proposed Jenkins on Kubernetes section.\nMy intention was to use it as a guide during the implementation phase of the project, but when the development phase kicked off, my mentors and I thought of a better approach to creating a new Jenkins on Kubernetes section which was to add the Jenkins on Kubernetes contents to existing related sections for easier navigation and better user experience.\nAn example of this approach would be creating the Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes section under the Installing Jenkins section rather than putting it under an entirely new section.\nWith this new approach, I was assigned a task to create a skeleton with all the proposed Jenkins on Kubernetes sections on Jenkins.io and mark these sections as\nWork In Progress (WIP).\nThe Plan was to use this skeleton as a guide throughout the GSOD Project.\nThe Jenkins on Kubernetes skeleton PR can be found here.\n\nDocumenting Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nWhile working on this project, I had to do a lot of research and test all the documented steps locally before pushing the documentation out for review.\nI also made sure to use updated terms and terminologies where necessary like Controller instead of Master and Agents instead of Slave.\n\nDuring the documentation phase, I was able to work on documenting Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes with three sections Helm, Set of Yaml files and Jenkins Operator.\nI also worked on creating a directory for Jenkins on kubernetes sample files in Jenkins.io repository, documenting Scaling Jenkins on Kubernetes and Jenkins on AWS which is still in progress.\n\nWork Done\n\nPull Requests : All the pull requests I submitted to Jenkins.io documentation can be found here.\nThis spreadsheet contains links to the published documentation on Jenkins.io.\nThe spreadsheet also highlights the initial proposed tasks and the status of each of them.\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes documentation, you can check out pending tasks here and reach out in the Jenkins documentation gitter channel.\n\nChallenges\n\nUsing a Windows computer was a bit of a challenge for me.\nTo run Jenkins.io locally, the project uses GNU/Make and Docker in order to generate the fully statically generated jenkins.io web site.\nThe key tool for converting source code into the site is the Awestruct static site generator, which is downloaded automatically as part of the build process.\nTo achieve this, I needed to have GNU/Make and Docker available on my machine.\nDocker was not a problem, but to achieve the latter, I needed to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\nWSL had two versions WSL1 and WSL2. Using WSL2 would have been much more convenient, but my version of windows wasn’t compatible with WSL2 as it required Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher for x64 systems.\nWith this obstacle, I had to stick to making WSL1 work but I still couldn’t get this to work, a series of issues came up which I was able to pass through with the help of my mentors until I got stuck at permission issues.\nI raised the issue with my mentor and after looking through the issue with me and trying to solve it to no avail, he suggested setting up an Ubuntu VM in Hyper-V.\nThis article helped me achieve this and that solved my problem.\n\nWhat did I learn?\n\nI learned a lot more about the Jenkins project, Kubernetes, helm package manager, Jenkins Operator and much more.\nThis project also gave me the opportunity to work with cloud providers like AWS which was totally new to me and also learn from field experts through knowledge sharing sessions and weekly meetings with my mentors and org admin.\nMy technical writing skill and communication skill have definitely become better and I owe it to this project.\n\nOverall, contributing to the Jenkins.io project is an amazing experience for me.\nI have been using Jenkins, and the fact that I was able to contribute to the organization and collaborate with the community is an honor.","title":"GSOD Project Report: Document Jenkins on Kubernetes","tags":["kubernetes","helm","documentation","gsod","gsod2020"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"048474b0-1674-5ecc-b72f-376e9c14e52a","slug":"/blog/2020/11/05/installing-jenkins-on-kubernetes/","strippedHtml":"We are super excited to announce that the Document Jenkins on Kubernetes Project recently merged its first PR into Jenkins.io.\nThis PR adds a new Kubernetes section to the existing Installing Jenkins chapter of Jenkins.io.\n\nThis new section describes two options to install/run Jenkins on Kubernetes, how to setup a minikube cluster on which to run your Jenkins deployment and finally a bonus segment that explains some Post-installation setups such as unlocking Jenkins, customizing Jenkins with plugins and creating your first administrator user.\n\nThe first installation option covered in this section is helm a package manager for Kubernetes whose package format is called a chart. The helm section covers the prerequisites for installing Jenkins on Kubernetes using Helm, installing and configuring helm, creating a persistent volume and service account, and finally, Installing Jenkins.\n\nThe second option describes how to install Jenkins using a set of yaml files.\nThis section explains how to create a Jenkins deployment file, Deploy Jenkins, grant access to jenkins service, and finally access your Jenkins dashboard after installation.\n\nSplitting the Installing Jenkins Chapter\n\nThe addition of the Kubernetes section highlighted a long-standing challenge with the Installing Jenkins chapter.\nIt was too long and contained too many topics, making it difficult and unpleasant for\nmost users to navigate.\nTo top the icing on the cake and further improve the experience on Jenkins documentation users, another PR was merged into Jenkins.io to split the Installing Jenkins chapter into smaller chapters for better separation of concerns and easy navigation. This PR also redirects bookmarks that linked to the previous locations like https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/#debianubuntu using Javascript.\n\nThe image above is a snapshot of what the Installing Jenkins chapter looked like before the PR.\nAll sections of this chapter such as docker, Kubernetes and others were lumped up on the same page making it too long with so much information thereby making it difficult to navigate or even find information on this page.\n\nThis snapshot shows what the Installing Jenkins chapter looks like after the PR.\nWith this chapter split into smaller sections, it’s neater, clearer and most importantly easier to navigate to the section of interest without having to scroll through so much information that’s not necessarily needed.\n\nTesting, Participating and Contributing\n\nThe Jenkins Community invites the general public to try out these documentation updates and give feedback to help us further improve the documentation.\nIf you have any feedback, suggestions, or would like to contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes project,  drop a message indicating your interest in the Jenkins documentation Gitter channel.\nYou can also find the Google season of docs office hour notes and recordings for Jenkins on Kubernetes here.\nGSOD office hours take place twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays between 6 pm GMT+1 and 7 pm GMT+1, if you would like to be part of these meetings, you can indicate interest in the Jenkins Documentation Gitter channel and we would be happy to have you.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nInstalling Jenkins on Kubernetes PR\n\nSplitting Installing Jenkins Chapter PR\n\nDocument Jenkins on Kubernetes Project\n\nGSoD Proposal\n\nGSoD Office Hours Notes\n\nGoogle Season of Docs - Startup\n\nGoogle Season of Docs on jenkins.io\n\nDocs SIG for Google Season of Docs startup ( video)","title":"Document Jenkins on Kubernetes: Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes Documentation Release","tags":["kubernetes","helm","documentation","gsod","gsod2020"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"0691e7e4-2e97-54ec-ab3c-e0f175b8a679","slug":"/blog/2020/09/25/document-jenkins-on-kubernetes-introduction/","strippedHtml":"I’m thrilled to announce that I will be participating in Google Season of Docs (GSoD)\n2020 with the Jenkins project. I started contributing to Jenkins documentation during the technical writer\nexploration phase for Google Season of Docs 2020 and I must say, my journey so far\nhas been nothing short of amazing majorly because of the supportive community behind this project.\nI chose the Jenkins project because I understood this project from a user point of view as I had been exposed to setting up, configuring,\nand using Jenkins to automate CI/CD processes. I piqued interest in two of Jenkins project ideas,\nPlugin documentation migration and update and Document Jenkins on Kubernetes, submitted proposals for these two projects and to my utmost joy, the latter was selected.\n\nIn this article, I’m going to be explaining what my selected project is about and why this project is important to the Jenkins community and its users.\n\nIntroduction\n\nKubernetes is a platform-agnostic container orchestration tool created by Google and heavily supported\nby the open-source community as a project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.\nIt allows you to use container instances and manage them for scaling and fault tolerance.\nIt also handles a wide range of management activities that would otherwise require separate solutions or custom code,\nincluding request routing, container discovery, health checks, and rolling updates.\n\nKubernetes is compatible with the majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests,\ndeploy builds in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.\nOne of the most popular CI/CD tools now is Jenkins for the following reasons:\n\nIt is open-source and free.\n\nit is user-friendly, easy to install and does not require additional installations or components.\n\nJenkins is also quite easy to configure, modify and extend.\n\nIt deploys code and generates test reports.\n\nIt also boasts a rich plugin ecosystem. The extensive pool of plugins makes Jenkins flexible and allows building, deploying and automating across various platforms.\n\nJenkins can be configured according to the requirements for continuous integrations and continuous delivery.\n\nJenkins is available for all platforms and different operating systems, whether it is OS X, Windows or Linux.\n\nMost of the integration work is automated. Hence fewer integration issues. This saves both time and money over the lifespan of a project.\n\nThe following reasons have made Jenkins on Kubernetes a popular theme for Jenkins users, however,\nthere’s currently no central location for documentation describing Jenkins on Kubernetes,\nthereby making it difficult for Jenkins on Kubernetes users to navigate and find information.\nThis project would create a new Kubernetes Volume on Jenkins.io which would describe the concepts,\ntechniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins.\n\nCurrent State\n\nThere are a lot of presentations and articles about running Jenkins on Kubernetes, however,\nthere’s no central location for describing Jenkins on Kubernetes. This makes it difficult for:\n\nJenkins on Kubernetes users to navigate and find information\n\nTrack, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes\n\nProject Improvements\n\nTo solve the existing issue with Jenkins on Kubernetes documentation,\na new Kubernetes volume will be created on Jenkins.io.\nThis Volume is going to aggregate user guides, information on cloud providers and demos on Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nYou can find the proposed contents for the new volume here.\nFeel free to comment on any suggestions you might have in the proposed content doc.\n\nThis project will also provide the following advantages:\n\nImprove the user experience of Jenkins on Kubernetes users by giving them a one-stop-shop for information on Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nMake it easy to track, update and maintain information on Jenkins on Kubernetes using the Solutions page\n\nReference the existing community documentation for Jenkins on K8s (plugins and tools/integrations).\n\nHow to guides, tutorials and explanations of concepts and techniques in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\nJust-In-Time documentation which means that rather than documenting every feature comprehensively,\nwe will produce and release documentation in bits but continuously based on popular questions,\nfeedback and area of interests gathered from the community and users.\n\nProject Timeline\n\nFind below a summary of the project timeline.\n\nCommunity bonding ( August 17 - September 13 )\n\nSet up a communication channel and time (due to time difference).\n\nRefine my goals and set expectations on both sides.\n\nLearn more about the community and Jenkins.\n\nGather and thoroughly study existing resources that will be useful and helpful to the project.\n\nPre-planning of the project\n\nContacting Stakeholders and onboarding contributors\n\nDocumentation Period\n\nThis period is going to be focused on creating contents which include user guides,\ntutorials, demos, etc. for Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nSome of the topics to be covered include Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes,\nAdministering Jenkins on Kubernetes, Cloud providers and much more.\n\nDocumentation Timeline\n\n1st Month (September - October)\n\nSome basic prerequisites for installing jenkins on kubernetes include docker, a kubernetes cluster, and optionally Helm or the Jenkins Operator for Kubernetes.\n\nHelm is a package manager which automates the process of installing, configuring, upgrading, and removing complex Kubernetes application. A Helm chart defines several Kubernetes resources as a set. Helm can make deployments easier and repeatable because all resources for an application are deployed by running one command.\n\nHelm has two elements, a client (helm) and a server (Tiller). The server element runs inside a Kubernetes cluster and manages the installation of charts. With Helm, configuration settings are kept in values.yaml file separate from the manifest formats. The configuration values can be changed according to application need without touching the rest of the manifest.\n\nOn the other hand, the Jenkins operator is a Kubernetes native operator which fully manages Jenkins on Kubernetes. It is easy to install with just a few manifests and allows users to configure and manage Jenkins on Kubernetes. To run jenkins-operator, you need to have a running Kubernetes cluster and kubectl installed.\n\nThe Jenkins Operator provides out of the box:\n\nIntegration with Kubernetes — preconfigured kubernetes-plugin for provisioning dynamic Jenkins Slaves as Pods\n\nPipelines as Code — declarative way to version your pipelines in VCS\n\nExtensibility via Groovy scripts or Configuration as Code plugin-customize your Jenkins, configure OAuth authorization and more\n\nSecurity and Hardening — an initial security hardening of Jenkins instance via Groovy scripts to prevent security vulnerabilities\n\nIn the first month, the focus will be on documenting an introductory section.\nThis section will include but is not limited to Setting up Kubernetes cluster, Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes, exploring the various approaches by which this can be achieved such as using helm package manager or the Jenkins Operator as explained above and Administering Jenkins on Kubernetes.\n\n2nd Month (October - November)\n\nIn the second month, the focus will be on documenting how to setup up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Kubernetes on different cloud providers.\nSome of the cloud providers we will be looking at include but are not limited to:\n\nAmazon Web Service (AWS)\n\nAzure Kubernetes Service\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\n3rd Month (November - December)\n\nIn the final month, the focus will be on creating demos and tutorials,\nsubmitting project report, evaluation of mentors and finally,\npublishing a report of my experience as a participant in Season of Docs.\n\nConclusion\n\nJenkins community is actively working towards improving its documentation to create a better\nexperience for Jenkins users and invites technical writers to join the community and contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes project.\n\nTo contribute to the Jenkins on Kubernetes project, simply join the Jenkins documentation Gitter channel and drop a message,\nyou can also find the Google season of docs office hour notes and recordings for Jenkins on Kubernetes here.\nGSOD office hours take place twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays between 6pm GMT+1 and 7pm GMT+1,\nif you would like to be part of these meetings, you can indicate interest in the Jenkins Documentation\nGitter channel and we would be happy to have you.\n\nIf you are also a newcomer and would like to contribute to Jenkins, documentation is a great place to contribute.\nA lot of small patches can be done from the GitHub web interface even without cloning repositories locally.\nYou can find some good first issues to get started with here.\n\nFind more information on contributing to Jenkins documentation here.\nIf you have further questions about the Jenkins on Kubernetes project or contributing to Jenkins,\nyou can reach out on the Jenkins documentation Gitter channel.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nGSoD Proposal\n\nGSoD Office Hours Notes\n\nGoogle Season of Docs - Startup\n\nGoogle Season of Docs on jenkins.io\n\nDocs SIG for Google Season of Docs startup ( video)","title":"Documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes Introduction","tags":["kubernetes","documentation","gsod","gsod2020"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"gsod","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
