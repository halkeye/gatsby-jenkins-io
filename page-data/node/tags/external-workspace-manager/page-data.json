blog post is the last one from the series of\nGoogle Summer of Code 2016, External Workspace Manager Plugin project.\nThe previous posts are:\n\nIntroductory blog post\n\nAlpha release announcement\n\nBeta release announcement\n\nIn this post I would like to announce the 1.0.0 release of the External Workspace Manager Plugin version to the main\nupdate center.\n\nHere’s a highlight of the available features:\n\nWorkspace share and reuse across multiple jobs, running on different nodes\n\nAutomatic workspace cleanup\n\nProvide custom workspace path on the disk\n\nDisk Pool restrictions\n\nFlexible Disk allocation strategies\n\nAll the above are detailed, with usage examples, on the plugin’s\ndocumentation page.\n\nFuture work\n\nCurrently, there is work in progress for the workspace browsing feature (see pull request\n#37).\nAfterwards, I’m planning to integrate fingerprints, so that the user can view a specific workspace in which\nother jobs was used.\nA particular feature that would be nice to have is to integrate the plugin with at least one disk provider\n(e.g. Amazon EBS, Google Cloud Storage).\n\nMany other features and improvements are still to come, they are grouped in the phase 3 EPIC:\nJENKINS-37543.\nThe plugin’s repository is on GitHub.\nIf you’d like to come up with new features or ideas, contributions are very welcome.\n\nClosing\n\nThis was a Google Summer of Code 2016 project.\nA summary of the contributions that I’ve made to the Jenkins project during this time may be found\nhere.\nIt was a great experience, from which I learned a lot, and I’d wish I could repeat it every year.\n\nI’d like to thank to my mentors, Oleg Nenashev and\nMartin d’Anjou for all their support, good advices and help they gave me.\nAlso, thanks to the Jenkins contributors with which I have interacted and helped me during this period.\n\nIf you have any issues in setting up or using the plugin, please feel free to ask me on the plugin’s Gitter\nchat.\nAny feedback is welcome, and you may provide it either on the Gitter chat, or on\nJira by using the external-workspace-manager-plugin component.\n\nLinks\n\nProject repository\n\nWork product page\n\nGSoC

blog post is a continuation of the External Workspace Manager Plugin related posts, starting with\nthe introductory blog post, and followed by\nthe alpha version release announcement.\n\nAs the title suggests, the beta version of the External Workspace Manager Plugin was launched!\nThis means that it’s available only in the\nExperimental Plugins Update Center.\n\nTake care when installing plugins from the Experimental Update Center, since they may change in\nbackward-incompatible ways.\nIt’s advisable not to use it for Jenkins production environments.\n\nThe plugin’s repository is on GitHub.\nThe complete plugin’s documentation can be accessed\nhere.\n\nWhat’s new\n\nBellow is a summary of the features added so far, since the alpha version.\n\nMultiple upstream run selection strategies\n\nIt has support for the\nRun Selector Plugin (which is still in beta),\nso you can provide different run selection strategies when allocating a disk from the upstream job.\n\nLet’s suppose that we have an upstream job that clones the repository and builds the project:\n\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate 'diskpool1'\n\nnode ('linux') {\n    exws (extWorkspace) {\n        checkout scm\n        sh 'mvn clean install -DskipTests'\n    }\n}\n\nIn the downstream job, we run the tests on a different node, but we reuse the same workspace as the previous job:\n\ndef run = selectRun 'upstream'\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate selectedRun: run\n\nnode ('test') {\n    exws (extWorkspace) {\n        sh 'mvn test'\n    }\n}\n\nThe selectRun in this example selects the last stable build from the upstream job.\nBut, we can be more explicit, and select a specific build number from the upstream job.\n\ndef run = selectRun 'upstream',\n selector: [$class: 'SpecificRunSelector', buildNumber: UPSTREAM_BUILD_NUMBER]\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate selectedRun: run\n// ...\n\nWhen the selectedRun parameter is given to the exwsAllocate step, it will allocate the same workspace that was\nused by that run.\n\nThe Run Selector Plugin has several run selection strategies that are briefly explained\nhere.\n\nAutomatic workspace cleanup\n\nProvides an automatic workspace cleanup by integrating the\nWorkspace Cleanup Plugin.\nFor example, if we need to delete the workspace only if the build has failed, we can do the following:\n\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate diskPoolId: 'diskpool1'\n\nnode ('linux') {\n    exws (extWorkspace) {\n        try {\n            checkout scm\n            sh 'mvn clean install'\n        } catch (e) {\n            currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'\n            throw e\n        } finally {\n            step ([$class: 'WsCleanup', cleanWhenFailure: false])\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nMore workspace cleanup examples can be found at this\nlink.\n\nCustom workspace path\n\nAllows the user to specify a custom workspace path to be used when allocating workspace on the disk.\nThe plugin offers two alternatives for doing this:\n\nby defining a global workspace template for each Disk Pool\n\nThis can be defined in the Jenkins global config, External Workspace Definitions section.\n\nby defining a custom workspace path in the Pipeline script\n\nWe can use the Pipeline DSL to compute the workspace path.\nThen we pass this path as input parameter to the exwsAllocate step.\n\ndef customPath = \"${env.JOB_NAME}/${PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER}/${env.BUILD_NUMBER}\"\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate diskPoolId: 'diskpool1', path: customPath\n// ...\n\nFor more details see the afferent\ndocumentation page.\n\nDisk Pool restrictions\n\nThe plugin comes with Disk Pool restriction strategies.\nIt does this by using the restriction capabilities provided by the\nJob Restrictions Plugin.\n\nFor example, we can restrict a Disk Pool to be allocated only if the Jenkins job in which it’s allocated was triggered\nby a specific user:\n\nOr, we can restrict the Disk Pool to be allocated only for those jobs whose name matches a well defined pattern:\n\nWhat’s next\n\nCurrently there is ongoing work for providing flexible disk allocation strategies.\nThe user will be able to define a default disk allocation strategy in the Jenkins global config.\nSo for example, we want to select the disk with the most usable space as default allocation strategy:\n\nIf needed, this allocation strategy may be overridden in the Pipeline code.\nLet’s suppose that for a specific job, we want to allocate the disk with the highest read speed.\n\ndef extWorkspace = exwsAllocate diskPoolId: 'diskpool1', strategy: fastestRead()\n// ...\n\nWhen this feature is completed, the plugin will enter a final testing phase.\nIf all goes to plan, a stable version should be released in about two weeks.\n\nIf you have any issues in setting up or using the plugin, please feel free to ask me on the plugin’s Gitter\nchat.\nAny feedback is welcome, and you may provide it either on the Gitter chat, or on\nJira by using the external-workspace-manager-plugin component.\n\nLinks\n\nProject repository\n\nProject intro blog post\n\nAlpha version announcement\n\nGSoC page\n\nJenkins GSoC Page","title":"GSoC: External
