addition to WAR files and Docker images, the Jenkins project provides native installers for each weekly and LTS release.\nThere are installers available for Linux distributions, Windows, macOS and other operating systems.\nThere are also installers provided by third parties.\nYou can find the list of these installers on the Downloads page.\n\nIn this blog post, we announce the upcoming deprecation of the macOS native installer.\nWe will review the replacement options and the rollout plan.\n\nWhy?\n\nMaintaining installers is a significant maintenance effort for the project\nbecause installers require testing and, sometimes, specific platforms and environments for packaging.\nWhen installers lose relevance for the majority of the Jenkins audience, we remove them or handover maintenance to third parties on other areas.\nFor macOS, there are currently two types of packages: native installers with GUI for desktop versions and Homebrew packages.\nSince Homebrew is now a defacto standard package manager for macOS users, from the Jenkins standpoint it made sense to deprecate the native installers.\n\nWhy now?\nThere is ongoing work on automating Jenkins Core releases within the Jenkins infrastructure.\nLong story short, we are moving Jenkins release pipelines to Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure.\nThis environment does not offer macOS machines that are needed to produce native installers.\nIf you are interested to know more, there will be a How Jenkins Builds and Delivers Jenkins in the Cloud talk presented by Olivier Vernin at DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Europe in Lisbon (use the JWFOSS code for a 30% discount!).\n\nWe could have used an external service for building macOS installers,\nbut it would have added an additional point of failure and implementation/maintenance overhead.\nSo we discussed it in the developer mailing list and agreed that it is better to just deprecate and then remove the packages.\n\nReplacing native installers\n\nIn the case of macOS, there are two main alternatives available: managing the service manually or migrating to Homebrew packages.\nBefore doing a migration, we highly recommend backing up your instance.\n\nManaging Jenkins with WAR file on macOS\n\nIf your Jenkins instance was previously set up with a native installer,\nto update Jenkins it will be enough to replace the jenkins.war file in the installation directory and restart the instance.\nThe services will keep running as it was configured before the migration.\nThe default installation directory is /Applications/Jenkins/jenkins.war\n\nManaging Jenkins with Homebrew\n\nInstalling Jenkins with Homebrew is a way to go for those who want to install Jenkins using a package manager.\nThere are two Homebrew formulas for Jenkins: jenkins for Weekly releases and jenkins-lts for LTS ones.\nThese packages are supported by a third party (Homebrew community),\nand they may be not as frequently updated as packages supported by the Jenkins project directly.\n\nBefore doing a migration from macOS Native installers to HomeBrew, please make sure to backup your Jenkins instance.\nThere are no automatic migration tools available, and the installation may corrupt your JENKINS_HOME or service configuration files in edge cases.\n\nIf you switch to Homebrew, you will need to properly migrate the JENKINS_HOME data to the new location.\nWe do not provide an official migration guide, but it is possible to find some guidelines on the Web.\n\nSample commands:\n\nInstall the latest Weekly version: brew install jenkins\n\nInstall a specific Weekly version: brew install jenkins@YOUR_VERSION\n\nStart the Jenkins service: brew services start jenkins\n\nRestart the Jenkins service: brew services restart jenkins\n\nUpdate the Jenkins version: brew upgrade jenkins\n\nFor more information see the documentation for Homebrew packages on the macOS Download pages.\n\nRollout plan\n\nmacOS native packaging is considered as deprecated starting from Jenkins 2.206 and Jenkins LTS 2.204.1\n\nFor Jenkins Weekly macOS native packaging will be removed with the switch to the new Jenkins release flow.\nThe exact date is to be determined.\n\nAfter the change, there will be no macOS native installers produced for new Jenkins Weekly releases\n\nReleases for previous versions will be available in this archive\n\nFor Jenkins LTS macOS will be removed with the switch to the new Jenkins release flow in the LTS baseline.\nThis change will happen only after the deployment of the new release flow in Jenkins Weekly.\n\nAfter the switch, there will be no macOS native installers produced for new Jenkins LTS releases\n\nReleases for previous versions will be available in this archive\n\nSee the discussion on the developer mailing list for more information.\n\nQuestions and feedback\n\nIf you have any questions or want to provide feedback, please use the developer mailing list thread mentioned above Platform SIG channels (chat, google group).\nAny feedback will be much appreciated because we plan more installer/ and platform deprecations in the future.","title":"Jenkins macOS
