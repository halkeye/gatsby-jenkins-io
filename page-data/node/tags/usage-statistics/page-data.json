I am pursing my major in Computer\nScience & Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India.  I\nam very proficient in writing code in Python, C++, Java and currently getting\nfamiliar and hopefully good in Groovy too.\n\nI have internship experiences in renowned institutions like Google and VMware\nwhere I worked with some exciting technologies for example Knowledge Graphs,\nBigTable, SPARQL, RDF in Google. I am a passionate computer science student who\nis always interested in learning and looking for new challenges and\ntechnologies.That’s how I came across to Google Summer of Code where I am\nworking on some exciting data mining problems which you are going to encounter\nbelow in this blog.\n\nProject Overview\n\nJenkins has collected anonymous usage information of more than 100,000\ninstallations which includes set of plugins and their versions etc and also\nrelease history information of the upgrades. This data collection can be used\nfor various data mining experiments. The main goal of this project is to perform\nvarious analysis and studies over the available dataset to discover trends\nin data usage. This project will help us to learn more about the Jenkins\nusage by solving various problems, such as:\n\nPlugin versions installation trends, will let us know about the versions installation behaviour of a given plugin.\n\nSpotting downgrades, which will warn us that something is wrong with the version from which downgrading was performed.\n\nCorrelating what users are saying (community rating) with what users are doing (upgrades/downgrades).\n\nDistribution of cluster size, where clusters represents jobs, nodes count which approximates the size of installation.\n\nFinding set of plugins which are likely to be used together, will setup pillar for plugin recommendation system.\n\nAs a part of the Google Summer of Code 2016, I will be working on the above\nmentioned problems. My mentors for the project are Kohsuke Kawaguchi and Daniel Beck. Some analyses has already been done over this\ndata but those are outdated as charts can be more clearer and interactive. This project aims to improvise existing\nstatistics and generating new ones discussed above.\n\nUse Cases\n\nThis project covers wide-range of the use-cases that has been derived from the\nproblems mentioned above.\n\nUse Case 1: Upgrade/Downgrade Analysis\n\nUnderstanding the trend in upgrades and downgrades have lots of utilities, some\nof them have already been explained earlier which includes measuring the\npopularity, spotting downgrades, giving warning about the wrong versions quickly\netc.\n\nUse Case 1.1: Plugin versions installation trends\n\nHere we are analysing the trend in the different version installations for a\ngiven plugin. This use-case will help us to know about:\n\nTrend in the upgrade to the latest version released for a given plugin.\n\nTrend in the popularity decrement of the previous versions after new version release.\n\nFind the most popular plugin version at any given point of time.\n\nUse Case 1.2: Spotting dowgrades\n\nHere we are interested to know, how many installations are downgraded from any\ngiven version to previously used version. Far fetched goal of this analysis is\nto give warning when something goes wrong with the new version release, which\ncan be sensed using downgrades performed by users. This analysis can be\naccomplished by studying the monotonic property of the version number vs.\ntimestamp graph for a given plugin.\n\nUse Case 1.3: Correlation with the perceived quality of Jenkins release\n\nTo correlate what users are saying to what users are doing, we have community\nratings which tells us about the ratings and reviews of the releases and has\nfollowing parameters:\n\nUsed the release on production site w/o major issues.\n\nDon’t recommend to other.\n\nTried but rolled it back to the previous version.\n\nFirst parameters can be calculated from the Jenkins usage data and third\nparameter is basically spotting downgrades(use case 1.2). But the second\nparameter is basically an expression which is not possible to calculate. This\nanalysis is just to get a subjective idea about the correlation.\n\nUse Case 2: Plugin Recommendation System\n\nThis section involves setting up ground work for the plugin recommendation\nsystem. The idea is to find out the set of plugins which are most likely to be\nused together. Here we will be following both content based filtering as well as\ncollaborative filtering approach.\n\nCollaborative Filtering\n\nThis approach is based upon analysing large amount of information on\ninstallation’s behaviours and activities. We have implicit form of the data\nabout the plugins, that is for every install ids, we know the set of plugins\ninstalled. We can use this information to construct plugin usage graph where\nnodes are the plugins and the edges between them is the number of installations\nin which both plugins are installed together.\n\nContent-based Filtering\n\nThis method is based on a properties or the content of the item for example\nrecommending items that are similar to the those that a user liked in the past\nor examining in the present based upon some properties. Here, we are utilizing\nJenkins\nplugin dependency graph to learn about the properties of a plugin. This graph\ntells us about dependent plugins on a given plugin as well as its dependencies\non others. Here is an example to show, how this graph is use for content based\nfiletring, suppose if a user is using “CloudBees Cloud Connector”, then we can\nrecommend them for “CloudBees Registration Plugin” as both plugins are dependent\non “CloudBees Credentials Plugin”.\n\nAdditional Details\n\nYou may find the complete project proposal along with the detailed design of the\nuse-cases with their implementation details here in the\ndesign\ndocument.\n\nA complete version of the use-case 1: Upgrade & Downgrade Analysis should be\navailable in late June and basic version of plugin recommendation system will be\navailable in late July.\n\nI do appreciate any kind of feedback and suggestions.  You may add comments in\nthe\ndesign\ndoc.  I will be posting updates about the statistics generation status on the\njenkins-dev mailing\nlist and jenkins-infra mailing list.\n\nLinks:\n\nDesign Doc\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nGithub infra-stats\n\nJenkins statistics\n\nJenkins Plugin Dependency Graph\n\nGithub GSoC Jenkins Usage Statistics Analysis","title":"GSoC Project Intro: Usage Statistics Analysis","tags":["usage-statistics","gsoc"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"usage-statistics","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
