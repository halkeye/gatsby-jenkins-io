Behold, the first release of Hudson ever made by a not-employed-by-Sun Kohsuke (as we covered last week). This iteration of Hudson contains only bug fixes, check the listing below for the specifics on which bugs have been fixed (1.355 is looking like it will contain a number of fixes as well). The release of 1.354 comes slightly later than usual given some of the logistics that needed to, or still need to be resolved.\n\nOne of the infrastructure issues that’s half-way resolved is the question of Debian/Ubuntu packages. Kohuske has packages uploaded in an experimental apt repository on hudson-labs.org which you can try out. That said, it’s not entirely clear whether this is going to be the preferred means of distributing native Debian/Ubuntu packages in the future (your mileage may vary).\n\nBugs fixed\n\nPOM parsing was still using the module root as the base for relative paths for alternate settings files. ( issue 6080)\n\nFix dynamic updates of build history table when CSRF protection is turned on. ( issue 6072)\n\nImproved the error reporting mechanism in LDAP setting.\n\nRaw console output contains garbage. ( issue 6034)\n\nFixed a file handle leak in the agents connection.

Bundled with this release was another localizations drop including translations for ca, es, fi, fr, hi_IN, it, nl, ru, and sv_SE locales. In addition to the nice fancy new community contributed translations, which you can help with by installing the Translation Assistance plugin, the 1.352 release includes the subtle enhancement of hyperlinking URLs in the console output.\n\nIn general, 1.352 is looking like a very solid release, that said, here’s the breakdown for this release:\n\nBugs fixed\n\nFixed a file handle leak when a copy fails.

( report)\n\nFixed Maven site goal archiving from agents. ( issue 5943)\n\nFixed a regression with NetBeans Hudson plugin progressive console output. ( issue 5941)\n\nFixed a situation where a failure in plugin start up can prevent massive number of job loss.\n\nEnhancements\n\nSupported JBoss EAP 5.0.0 GA. ( issue 5922)\n\nCLI commands on protected Hudson now asks a password interactively, if run on Java6.\n\nAdded CLI 'login' and 'logout' commands so that you don’t have to specify a credential for individual CLI invocation.\n\nURLs in the console output are now hyperlinks.\n\nImproved the URL annotation logic.\n\nAdd drag&drop support for f:repeatable lists and use this for the JDK/Ant/Maven installations in global config so these can be reordered.\n\nIntegrated a new round of community-contributed localizations (ca, es, fi, fr, hi_IN, it, nl, ru, and sv_SE locales.)\n\nContributors\n\nThis release contains 63 commits, from six different contributors including our very own Subversion-loving Mike Rooney (mcrooney).\n\nabayer\n\njglick\n\nkohsuke\n\nmcrooney\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.352 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

On the enhancements side of the fence, the team added authentication support to the Hudson CLI ( issue 3796) allowing Hudson users with locked down installations to take advantage of everything the CLI has to offer.\n\nInternal to Hudson, some more changes from Alan Harder (a.k.a mindless, a.k.a The Garbage Man), deprecating or otherwise removing deprecated APIs. Alan’s been doing some great work on Hudson’s internals, if you’re coming out to this weekend’s hackathon, but sure to pat him on the back for his tireless efforts.\n\nBug fixes\n\nFix handling of relative paths in alternate settings.xml path for Maven projects.

Included in this release is Alan Harder’s (a.k.a mindless) old data monitor code, discussed previously in the post \" Call for Testers: The older the better.\" Included in this release were further updates to the japanese and german localizations of Hudson; if you’re interested in helping localize Hudson into more languages you can join the effort via the Internationalization page on the wiki.\n\nNow for the breakdown of the 1.349 release:\n\nBug fixes\n\nFix deserialization problem with fields containing double underscore. ( issue 5768)\n\nFix deserialization problem for Exception objects where the XML has bad/old data. ( issue 5769)\n\nFix serialization problem with empty CopyOnWriteMap.Tree. ( issue 5776)\n\nFixed a bug that can cause 404 in the form validation check.\n\nEnhancements\n\nRemote build result submission shouldn’t hang forever even if Hudson goes down.\n\nAdded a monitor for old or unreadable data in XML files and a manage screen to assist in updating files to the current data format and/or removing unreadable data from plugins that are no longer active. \"Manage Hudson\" page will show a link if any old/unreadable data was detected.\n\nAdded a mechanism to bundle init.groovy inside the war for OEM. ( report)\n\nAdded an extension point to annotate console output. ( issue 2137)\n\nContributors\n\nHudson 1.349 contains 43 commits from 6 contributors, due to the merging in of Alan Harder’s old-data-monitor branch the commit count is a bit off from the amount of code change that actually went out in 1.349.\n\nabayer\n\nkohsuke\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nswiest\n\nwyukawa\n\nAs usual, you can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.349 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

One of Alan’s branches old-data-monitor was merged into trunk with r28147 bringing with it some changes to help migrate older plugin datasets to newer formats.\n\nWhen I reached out to Alan earlier today on IRC ( #hudson on the Freenode) about the subject he agreed that polling the community for beta testers would be a good idea; this is where you come in. Per Alan’s message to the dev@ mailing list:\n\nVisit your \"Manage Hudson\" screen to see if the notice about old/unreadable data appears. I’ll be curious to see which of the old deprecated data structures are actually out there in people’s XML files.\n\nInstead of waiting for the release candidate to be packaged Wednesday evening, I’ve gone ahead and published the artifact from build #4544 which can be downloaded here: hudson.war\n\nIf you have an old Hudson installation with, testing this build would be incredibly useful. Alan went on to say:\n\nIf people find issues with OldDataMonitor, they should file them at issues.hudson-ci.org in \"core\" component and assign them to \"mindless\".\n\nThis change does not mutate any data (or at least it shouldn’t) so it should be safe, be on the look out for exceptions in Hudson’s log on startup.","title":"Call for Testers: The older the better","tags":["development","core","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
