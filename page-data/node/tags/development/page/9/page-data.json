The release contains primarily bug-fixes but has a few enhancements baked into it as well. As mentioned in \" [Incoming! More Translations\", 1.344 incorporates a number of community-driven translations (see the other post for more information). Additionally, 1.344 removes the \"easter egg\" background image I wrote about in a post to my personal blog: Mourning Sun Enough of the small talk, here’s the breakdown.\n\nBugs fixed\n\nRemoved the forced upper casing in parameterized builds. ( issue 5391)\n\nPassword parameter on the disk should be encrypted. ( issue 5420)\n\nDuplicate entries on Upstream/Downstream project with \"Build modules in parallel\". ( issue 5293)\n\n\"Projects tied on\" should be \"Projects tied to\". ( issue 5451)\n\nFixed the bug that prevents update center metadata retrieval in Jetty. ( issue 5210)\n\nEnhancements\n\nShow which plugins have already been upgraded in Plugin Manager. ( issue 2313)\n\nShow Hudson upgrade status on manage page instead of offering same upgrade again. ( issue 3055)\n\nMake badges in build history line up. ( report)\n\nContributors\n\nThis release of Hudson contained 44 commits from 5 different contributors to \"core\":\n\nabayer\n\nkohsuke\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nhuybrechts\n\nAs usual, you can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.\n\nUpdate: This post was written a day before issue 5536 was discovered. I recommend waiting until 1.345 to update any production Hudson instances.","title":"Hudson 1.344 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
