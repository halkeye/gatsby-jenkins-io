Here are 3 ways you can give back to the community to ensure that everyone benefits and Jenkins keeps growing…​\n\nGiving it back to the community #1: vendor+community=win\n\n+\nJenkins is becoming ubiquitous enough that tool vendors and service providers often find their users asking them to provide Jenkins plugins. The challenge for these companies is that they don’t necessarily possess the necessary Jenkins expertise to do one. +\n +\n\n+\nHere at the Jenkins project, what we are trying to do is to work with these people to deliver a plugin. It gets the job done a whole lot more quickly if the vendor brings in their expertise on their tool/services and we bring in our expertise on Jenkins plugin development. +\n +\n\n+\nFor example, we recently worked with https://www.soasta.com/press-releases/soasta-and-cloudbees-partner-to-deliver-first-jenkins-plugin-for-continuous-integration-on-mobile-platforms/[SOASTA] to help them open-source the plugin they developed in house, then help them add a whole bunch of new functionalities. By open-sourcing a plugin in the Jenkins project, vendors win as the community helps fix bugs and improve plugins. The Jenkins project wins by building relationship with vendors. And finally the users win by having more integrations. +\n +\n\n+\nSo the next time you ask your vendor to provide a Jenkins integration, please tell them to drop us a note, and we are happy to talk. +\n +\n\nGiving it back to the community #2: scratch your itch and take credit\n\n+\n\n+\nIf you are working for a company and hacking some Jenkins plugins for your team, then you should definitely consider contributing those changes back. Let’s take https://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/11/22/sony-contributes-to-jenkins-software-tool/[Robert and Tomas] for example, who contributed a number of significant plugins from Sony Mobile. +\n +\n\n+\nThe company wins, because it shows off their technical excellence. Plus the flexibility to let engineers work on these OSS projects helps them retain and attract high-caliber developers. It also lets the community shoulder some of the burdens of maintaining plugins.\n\n+\nYou win, because now you have more things to show to future employers. After all, GitHub is your new resume! And when you aren’t sure how to go about implementing a feature or fixing a bug, open-sourcing your plugin lets us jump in and get you unstuck.\n\n+\nThe community wins, thanks to your new awesome plugin.\n\n+\nBesides all of those pragmatic reasons, when you share something with others and they tell you how much it helped them, even if it’s just one or two people, it’s a deeply moving experience.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIt just has so many advantages, it’s a no brainer! +\n +\n\nGiving it back to the community #3: contribute by proxy\n\n+\n\n+\nIf you are working for a company, wanting to see particular features/integrations in Jenkins but don’t have time to do it yourself, there’s yet another way, and that’s to contribute by proxy. +\n +\n\n+\nThe idea is that you contract with those who already know how to develop Jenkins plugins, and you have them produce/improve Jenkins plugins in open-source. https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Praqma[Praqma] is a great example of one such company. They are well connected in the community, with lots of experience under their belts, and your company takes the credit for the work. There are also a number of individuals who can do this for you. +\n +\n\n+\nWhy give it away something for free when you paid for it, you might ask. That’s because the code sitting in house rots when it’s not maintained by anybody. In contrast, when the rest of the world can hack on your code, you get occasional random bug fixes by strangers (the worst case), and sometimes it gets its own life (the best case.) +\n +\n\n+\nIf this way of giving back suits you better, feel free to send an e-mail to https://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html[the dev list].","title":"Giving Back to the Community:  3 Ways to Keep Jenkins Growing","tags":["development","core","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b995ccf2-ce62-5555-b39e-69d000170d61","slug":"/blog/2012/12/19/los-altos-hackathon-this-friday/","strippedHtml":"+\nWhat better way to end the year than to come join a little Jenkins hackathon this Friday afternoon with Kohsuke (the core developer), Max Spring (https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkow+Plugin[Jenkow plugin]), and hopefully other Jenkins hackers? +\n +\n\n+\nWe'll do this at https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204997319446652334724.0004d13cfa1eb16f65a99&msa=0&ll=37.377281,-122.113874&spn=0.007656,0.00478[CloudBees Los Altos office], starting around Friday 1pm. +\n +\n +\n[.small]#View https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204997319446652334724.0004d13cfa1eb16f65a99&msa=0&ie=UTF8&ll=37.377281,-122.113874&spn=0.007656,0.00478&t=h&source=embed[CloudBees Los Altos office] in a larger map# +\n +\n\n+\nOur plan is to primarily hack on the Jenkow plugin, but if you have other projects you'd like to hack on, that'd be welcome.

Jenkins potential to make peoples lives easier is really amazing.\nYou guys are amazing.\nAnd Kohsuke, you’re my personal hero :-)\n\nAll right, that being said, let’s move on with the story.\n\nMost people who like FreedomSponsors probably don’t know that Jenkins is sort of the reason it exists in the first place. That’s right, if it wasn’t for Jenkins I’d probably never had the idea for FS.\n\nThis is how it happened.\n\nI was playing with the ( Jenkins OpenID plugin), and I was having some trouble with it.\nAfter a little research, I found that there was a JIRA bug for it - ( JENKINS-9216: Make OpenID work with Google Apps accounts).\n\n\"Bummer\" - I thought - \"Maybe I can try to debug it. Oh boy, but I don’t know anything about Jenkins code. That would be too…​ expensive! I bet there are a few people out there that would be willing to even pay a few bucks to the Jenkins crew to prioritize this.\"\n\nThe moment I thought that, a storm of ideas came rushing into my head.\nIt was like a conversation with myself in my mind.\n\n\"Wait a minute…​ why can’t people actually do just that?! They should be able to.\"\n\n\"Maybe a JIRA plugin could let them…​\"\n\n\"But what about other projects, ones that don’t use JIRA?\"\n\n\"Maybe there could be a central place for all those offers. If many people 'sponsor' the same issue, the developer who solve it might get a decent piece of gold - rightfully deserved. That could even free up more of their time to work on the projects they love :-)\"\n\n\"The sponsors would pay the developers out of gratitude, and for the sake of keeping their word.\"\n\n\"This has the Agile spirit in it: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\"\n\nAnd I kept thinking, and it didn’t took very long until I had the whole \"sponsoring model\" in my head.\nI realised that that was one of the best ideas I had in my life. I was very excited and I had to act on it.\n\nI started studying Django on that same day. I had already learned some Python before and Django had been on my queue for some time. And I’m glad I did it. I’ve been building JavaEE (Java web) applications for about 8 years now, and, oh boy, Django makes things soooo much easier, and simpler, and faster to code - I’m in love with it…​ Okay, but I’m missing the point here.\n\nSo, I started building \"it\" alone on my free time. It took me a few days to pick a name for \"it\".\nThe \"FreedomSponsors\" name came very naturally - it rightfully conveys what the platform would do, and the spirit of software freedom that I’d like to encourage.\n\nSeven weeks later it was done. I had already bought the domain and created an account at Amazon AWS.\nSo I put it up and started bugging everyone about it.\nAnd guess who was the first person I wanted to tell? Kohsuke Kawaguchi :-)\nIt was just fair. So I sent him this email.\n\nOn Sun, Jul 8, 2012 at 3:36 AM, Tony França tonylampada@gmail.com wrote:\n\nHi Kohsuke.\nMy name is Tony, I’m a Software Architect.\nI’m a big fan and a (very) heavy user of Hudson - Jenkins.\nIt has really been enabling our company to move towards a \"continuous delivery\"-like development process in the past couple of years.\n\nSo, thank you for that.\n\nAlso, if it wasn’t for Jenkins, maybe I would never had the idea to build the FreedomSponsors web site.\nThat’s my personal project - an idea that I had about six weeks ago.\n\nYou see, most of the time I was developing it, I had you in mind.\nI have always felt that \"Jenkins is so great, that Kohsuke really deserves to get rich for it\".\n\nI just launched FreedomSponsors - a few minutes ago.\nIt just felt right to come here and tell you about it :-)\n\nLet’s see if I can get you rich now :-).\n\nCheers!\nTony Lâmpada\n\nAnd his reply just made my day\n\nOn Thu, Jul 12, 2012 at 5:19 PM, Kohsuke Kawaguchi wrote:\n\nCongratulations for launching your service.\n\nI thought about a similar idea long time ago over a lunch with my colleagues, but my hats off to you for actually making it real. I can imagine a lot of obstacles (most of those you already note in FAQ), but if this works out I think it’d be great.\n\nBy the way, I wonder if you have considered open-sourcing this, say under Aflo GPL. With the network effect and being the dominant contributor, it’s very difficult for anyone else to run the same code on public internet to compete with you, and it does let other people contribute small changes, and given your audience is open-source developers, I think it sends the right message as well as help you boost your development. It also seeds the ecosystem (of Bugzilla plugin, JIRA plugin, dashboard, etc.), too.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n\nYou see, FS’s code was still closed when I launched it. I was worried about competition indeed.\nBut his arguments were very convincing. Specially when he talked about sending the right message to the Free Software community. I thought about it for while and came to the conclusion that he has absolutely right. It still took me a few weeks until I moved the code to Github. I’m glad I did it. The feedback loop has been great.\n\nAnd that was not his only contribution. He also gave us this very useful piece of feeback:\n( JIRA plugin to link from tickets to FreedomSponsors)\n\nIndeed, that was a great idea. My friend and associate Arthur is the one who built it.\nKohsuke suggested that I joined the Jenkins crew at the ( Jenkins Governance meeting) to see if everyone would agree about installing it on Jenkins JIRA. Everyone liked the idea and had no ojections.\n\nI can’t say enough how trilled and honored I felt knowing that Jenkins would be the first project to install our plugin. Thank you folks. Thanks Kohsuke. You guys are awesome :-)\n\nNow FreedomSponsors is growing, slowly but steadily. And what makes us really happy is that almost every developer we tell about it just loves the idea. We’ve received valuable, constructive feedback from a lot of people who want to see us moving forward. That’s the best incentive that I could wish for.\n\nWe still have a lot of challenges ahead of us. The biggest and closest one in the horizon is to start a \"movement\" that will help spread within companies a culture of contributing more to the free software projects they depend on, by making they realise that that’s what’s best for everyone. If we can achieve that then we’ll have made the free software world even better.\n\nSo, everything I wrote so far is, hopefully, only the begginning of this story. And I’m really excited and looking forward to see it unfold. Being a part of it is even more exciting.\n\nWhat about you? If you want to be updated about, or even help write the next chapters, then\njoin, follow, like, read, spread the word, give feedback and contribute with code or new issues.\n\nThank you Jenkins crew, thank you Kohsuke.\nWe wouldn’t have made it here without you.","title":"Sponsor Jenkins bugs with Freedom Sponsors","tags":["development"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","id":"84e982b8-32fd-5c71-9923-2f8e688aebff","slug":"/blog/2012/03/06/critical-security-advisory-in-jenkins-core/","strippedHtml":"+\nWe've identified and fixed a critical security vulnerabilities in +\nJenkins core.

It's been 3 months, and I've finally took the opportunity to integrate them into Jenkins. +\n +\n\n+\nThe result is pretty amazing. Before this, we had 26 languages, with wildly varying degree of completeness, such as French, Japanese, German, etc. This is still pretty good, but this integration added updates to 40 languages, including 17 brand-new languages, pushing the total up to whopping 43 languages. Among the newly added languages are Arabic (sorry, no right-to-left support yet), Esperanto, Hebrew, as well as large amount of Chinese (both simplified and traditional) and Korean. +\n +\n\n+\nWhile working with this, I've also discovered an issue that prevented Jenkins from correctly showing Hebrew, Indonesian, and Yedish localizations.
