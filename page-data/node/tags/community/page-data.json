I want us to continue on that path.\nThis is a tremendous opportunity for community members to influence the direction of the project for the next two years.\nTo make this year‚Äôs election even better, we slightly modified the process by leveraging our new community platform aka community.jenkins.io.\n\nTo participate in the election, we ask every Jenkins community member to have an account on community.jenkins.io.\nYou can either reuse your Github account or create a new discourse account specific to community.jenkins.io.\nThe second requirement is to be able to showcase at least one contribution done before the first of September 2021.\nAs mentioned on jenkins.io.io/participate, they are many different ways to contribute to Jenkins and for many of them, it‚Äôs very difficult to measure.\nTherefore we‚Äôll trust participants and will not require that they provide evidence of contribution as part of their voter registration. We reserve the right to ban the specific account from the election process if we identify abuse.\nThe election works in three stages:\n\nIdentify voters and nominees\n\nVoting period\n\nAnnounce results\n\nVoters\n\nTo invite participants to vote, we need a list of email‚Äôs addresses that we would share with the Condorcet Internet Voting Service.\nTherefore we ask every community member who matches the requirements to join the group election-voter on community.jenkins.io.\nThe group will be open for joining during the registration period after we‚Äôll close registration during the voting period.\nWe‚Äôll use emails from the ‚Äúelection-voter‚Äù group members.\n\nNominees\n\nDuring the same period, we invite every community member to nominate candidates by sending a message to the group election-committee mentioning the position and the motivation.\nOn the 31 of October, the nomination period will end. We‚Äôll notify all the nominees and get confirmation that they are interested in running as a candidate.\nThe list of candidates will be announced on the 7th of November.\n\nEverybody can nominate candidates.\n\nThis year we are looking for nominees for the following positions:\n\nBoard members\n\nDocumentation Officer\n\nEvents Officer\n\nInfrastructure Officer\n\nRelease Officer\n\nSecurity Officer\n\nMore information about the different roles can be found on jenkins.io/project/team-leads.\n\nElection\n\nOn the 7th of November, once voters and candidates are identified, we‚Äôll invite everybody by email to vote using civs.cs.cornell.edu.\nAt this stage of the election, nobody will be allowed to register.\nVoting deadline is the 30th of November.\n\nResult\n\nAs soon as we have the election results, we‚Äôll publish them.\nElected members will begin their official roles on the 3rd of December 2021.\n\nKey Dates\n\nSep 20: Nomination and voter registration begin\n\nOct 31: Nomination deadline\n\nNov 07: Candidates announced, Registration deadline, voting start\n\nNov 30: Voting deadline\n\nDec 03: Results announced\n\nKey Information:\n\nEverybody can suggest candidates by sending a private message to the group election-committee.\n\nVoters register for the election by joining the public group election-voter.\n\nEmail participants will be shared with Condorcet Voting System to send voting invitations.\n\nNobody can register for the election once we send invitations to Condorcet Voting System.\n\nOnce the election is over, every member of the group\"election-voter\" will get a badge on https://community.jenkins.io as a ‚Äú2021 Election Participant‚Äù.\n\nOnce the election is over, every nominee will get the badge ‚Äú2021 Election Nominee‚Äù.\n\nCheers,","title":"Jenkins Election 2021","tags":["community","governance","governance-board","elections"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"olblak","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Olivier is the Jenkins infrastructure officer and Senior Operations Engineer at CloudBees.\nAs a regular contributor to the Jenkins infrastructure projects, he works on a wide range of tasks from services reliability to applications maintenance.</p>\n</div>","id":"olblak","irc":"olblak","linkedin":null,"name":"Olivier Vernin","slug":"/blog/author/olblak","twitter":"0lblak"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","id":"79c95b8e-55ea-534e-81a0-7d12215795cd","slug":"/blog/2021/07/16/gsoc-midterm-presentation/","strippedHtml":"Congratulations to all GSoC students who have made it through the first half of the GSoC 2021 coding phase!\n\nThis year, the Jenkins project has been participating in GSoC as part of the Continuous Delivery Foundation‚Äôs GSoC org.\nTo celebrate our GSoC students and the fantastic work they have been doing, the CDF is hosting an online meetup where students will present their work.\nStudents will be showcasing what they have learned and accomplished thus far in GSoC, demoing their work, and discussing their goals and plans for the second coding phase.\n\nThe CDF Google Summer of Code Midterm Demos will be held online on July 20th, 13:00 UTC -

From powering large enterprises needing a better way to manage their inventory to innovative tech firms looking to advance technologies and healthcare initiatives during a pandemic, you‚Äôll read about how teams everywhere solved their unique challenges ‚Äî with the help of Jenkins.\n\nJenkins is the Way to‚Ä¶\n\nIn our short User Story Survey, we ask Jenkins users to fill in the blank: Jenkins is the way to ‚Ä¶‚Äã‚Ä¶‚Äã\n\nWe‚Äôve seen results-oriented submissions like \"Jenkins is the way to deliver our new releases on time!\" and \"Jenkins is the way to understand and simplify your software workflows.\"  Several submissions riffed off of something like \"Jenkins is the way to completely automate your CI/CD workflow.\"  Meanwhile, others have had a bit more fun and languished praise on Jenkins, stating, \"Jenkins is the way to help teams focus on what is really important, make our life easier\" and, even, \"Jenkins is the way to save the day.\"\n\nIn this new eBook, we focus on the challenges users in the community face, and what they‚Äôve built using Jenkins to achieve their unique goals. For example, Build & Release Manager, Donald Morton, turned to Jenkins to establish a flexible, modern, and more efficient DevOps platform for Graylog, a leading log management platform serving the enterprise.\n\nWith a Jenkins assist, Mark Baumann, DevOps Engineer with ITK Engineering, created ‚Äú one CI to rule them all.‚Äù He told us that ‚ÄúJenkins provides a common CI/CD platform for all different kinds of projects and technology domains.‚Äù\n\nWhen IBM Lead Software Engineer Alec Rieger sought to simplify the build and testing pipeline for the company‚Äôs software engineers and developers, he also turned to Jenkins.  For a company the size of IBM, which services enterprise clients worldwide, Rieger wanted to help his colleagues manage many nodes on a large scale. Now, according to his Jenkins Is The Way user story, IBM uses Jenkins pipelines for each of their builds and relies on the flexibility and countless plugin features to continually improve their processes.\n\nStronger, Smarter, Faster Software Innovation\n\nWhile we all fondly think of Jenkins as a modest butler who has empowered developers with the open-source tools they need to succeed ‚Äî on JenkinsIsTheWay.io, we liken him to an unpretentious, yet powerful superhero.  And like any great superhero, he (or she!) is sure to save the day.\n\nFor our Jenkins users, that means results ‚Äî significant, measurable results with a common theme.  Using Jenkins has enabled you ‚Äî the user ‚Äî to help the businesses you serve save money, spin up software faster, and automate processes.  In doing so, you‚Äôve freed up developers and engineers from countless hours of mundane tasks.  Thanks to Jenkins, you‚Äôre empowering entire IT teams to innovate, focus on what they love to do and, ultimately, build great stuff.\n\nOf course, we devote much of our latest eBook to those victories.  Results like how RedHat‚Äôs releases are 5x faster thanks to Jenkins.  The fact that DevOps problem tickets were reduced by over 90% for Electronic Health Solutions.  And why the CTO at Cloudologia was psyched to share that ‚Äî with a Jenkins at the helm ‚Äî they were able to shorten onboarding for deployment & build release cycles from one week to a single day.\n\nShare Your User Story, Too!\n\nI am proud to share another common theme from the users who have submitted their story:  you turn to our community for collaboration, guidance, and advice.  A community of a million strong and growing, this eBook and JenkinsIsTheWay.io are other ways to provide you with the insight and lessons learned by developers and engineers, like you, to innovate and build next-generation technologies for companies of all sizes.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre ready to tell your story, we‚Äôre prepared to help you share it. Fill out our short questionnaire, and we‚Äôll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt as a thank you once it‚Äôs published!\n\nLinks\n\nJenkins IsThe Way.
