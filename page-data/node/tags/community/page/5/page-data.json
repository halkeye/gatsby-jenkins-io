Tyler Croy on the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nDaniel Beck was elected as Security Officer\n\nAlyssa Tong was elected as Events Officer\n\nNominations for Infrastructure, Release and Documentation officer positions were uncontested.\n\nOlivier Vernin was elected as Infrastructure Officer (uncontested)\n\nOliver Gondža was elected as Release Officer (uncontested)\n\nMark Waite was elected as Documentation Officer (uncontested)\n\nIf you are interested to learn more, please see the blog post below.\n\nBoard election details\n\nThe voting results are:\n\nOleg Nenashev (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nMark Waite loses to Oleg Nenashev by 181–127\n\nUllrich Hafner loses to Oleg Nenashev by 198–115, loses to Mark Waite by 171–133\n\nAlex Earl loses to Oleg Nenashev by 225–82, loses to Ullrich Hafner by 168–128\n\nOliver Gondža loses to Oleg Nenashev by 227–76, loses to Alex Earl by 151–136\n\nZhao Xiaojie (aka Rick) loses to Oleg Nenashev by 233–82, loses to Oliver Gondža by 160–131\n\nAlthough Mark Waite came second in the voting results, being on the board would violate the Corporate Involvement clause which states that \"the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%\".\nBased on that rule, the third seat Alex Earl will join the Jenkins board.\nAt the same time, Mark Waite will take the newly introduced role of Documentation officer.\n\nAll new board members are elected for a 2-year term, unless they step down earlier.\nThe estimated end of term for them is December 02, 2021.\nThe actual date will depend on the election schedule in 2021.\n\nOfficer election details\n\nWe have reelected all 5 officers for the new 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2020.\n\nAlyssa Tong won the biggest support as an Events officer ( voting results)\n\nDaniel Beck won the biggest support as a Security officer ( voting results)\n\nWhen an officer position has only one candidate that is willing to accept the nomination, there is no reason to vote on that position.\nThis year some nominees declined the nominations before the election happened, and 3 officer nominations were finally uncontested:\nOlivier Vernin - infrastructure officer,\nOliver Gondža - release officer,\nMark Waite - documentation officer.\n\nStatistics\n\nHere are some voting stats from these elections:\n\nTotal number of eligible accounts: 91,015\n\nTotal number of registered voters: 831\n\nTotal number of votes: 343\n\nThis election was hosted on the Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS).\nWhile preparing for the elections, we discovered that CIVS is unable to support our large number of eligible voters.\nWe created a voter registration system to identify voters and then registered those voters with CIVS.\nThe workaround required a slight voting delay.\nSpecial thanks to Olivier Vernin and Tracy Miranda who made it possible!\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nIn short term, the renewed board will focus on running the Jenkins governance processes (meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining next steps towards improving the project.\nOne of the priorities will be to organize knowledge and permission transfers to new board members so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThere are also pending activities like Jenkins' transition to Continuous Delivery Foundation which require attention from board members.\n\nFor longer term, there are some ideas floating around:\n  roadmap for key components,\n  long-anticipated architecture changes (UX revamp, pluggable storage, cloud native Jenkins),\n  adopting Linux Foundation best practices like Core Infrastructure Initiative,\n  contributor onboarding,\n  etc.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for further evolvement of the Jenkins project,\nand the board could help to facilitate them in the community.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to do so!\n\nFeedback\n\nWe will also also plan to conduct a public retrospective at one of the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meetings.\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process.\nPlease use the following channels for feedback and suggestions:\n\nThere is a Retrospective document in Google Docs.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\n\nFor ideas about the project improvements and next steps for the board,\nplease use the Jenkins Developers mailing list.\n\nFor private feedback, please send an email to the Jenkins Board or to Tracy Miranda.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2019 election announcement\n\n2019 election updates on Nov 08\n\nRetrospective

This was great\nand I wanted to share in hopes of encouraging more people to join.\nYou can learn more about the Google Summer of Code here: https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/\n\nCommunity Bonding\n\nThe first phase of the project is the community bonding phase. This is where the student and other mentors come together\nto lay out the plan for the project. It is important to set expectations and ensure that the student is well aware of\nwhat will take place and also made to feel welcome.\n\nParichay Barpanda was the student and he was super awesome from the get go. The project he was working on was the Gitlab\nBranch Source Plugin. More can be found here: jenkinsci/gitlab-branch-source-plugin\n\nFrom the mentor side it was myself and Justin Harringa. Justin was just amazing throughout this project and I seriously\ncould not have done this without him. He was encouraging, empathetic and just all around great. I would gladly serve\nwith him again.\n\nWe laid out our plan and guidance and got to work.\n\nFirst Evaluations\n\nThe first evaluation was quickly upon us and Parichay was ready!\nThe work he put in was nothing shy of amazing. We did our 1st demo and he really rocked it. A video of that demo can be\nfound on : Youtube\n\nSecond Evaluations\n\nThere was not much time to rest before we realized that phase II end was upon us but Parichay was ready. Again, he\nnailed it.\n\nThat demo can be found here\n\nMentors Submit Final Evaluations\n\nWe had our final evaluation and at this point Parichay was seasoned. He was getting issues assigned to him, working on\nlittle bug fixes and setting his roadmap for features. He absolutely blew Justin and I away.\n\nParichay’s final evaluation demo can be seen here\n\nAt the conclusion of the final demo’s, Justin and I met and went over Parichay’s final evaluation. At this point we had\nmet twice a week for several months, we have reviewed code daily, we had community involvement and most of all we had\nseen Parichay grow into a seasoned software developer.\n\nJustin and I were without a doubt passing Parichay on his entire body of work. I am actually tearing up typing this\nbecause I am so proud of Parichay.\n\nOrg Admin\n\nBeing an org admin for the 2019 Google Summer of Code project for the Jenkins organization was truly rewarding and couldn’t\nhave been accomplished without the help from Oleg Nenashev, Martin d’Anjou, Jeff Pearce and Lloyd Chang.\n\nAs an org admin we handled issues with mentors, community members and disagreements involving work. These items were only\na few and as a team we handled them accordingly.\n\nWe regularly met to discuss and plan. Coordinating and dealing with a project like Google Summer of Code is no small feat\nbut this team made it super easy and I am so thankful for them and all that I learned.\n\nClosing\n\nIn looking back at this experience I am so grateful for the opportunity I was given. This was such a rewarding experience\nto not only be able to mentor but also be an org admin. Not only will I be back next year (we are already in the\nplanning stages) but I highly encourage people reading this to consider joining. You will not be disappointed.\n\nI am so thankful for all the students, mentors and fellow org admins. Your dedication to open source is so valued. You\nshowed and continue to show what this project is all about, and that is being welcoming, open and transparent. Helping\npeople grow as individuals while learning skills is what I love about this community.\n\nThank you to everyone and I hope your futures are bright!","title":"Google Summer of Code Mentor and Org Admin Perspective","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2019","jenkins","community","events","mentor"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

I came across this initiative in a blog post. I had been contributing to Jenkins at the time and decided to have a chat with Oleg Nenashev and Tracy Miranda regarding the possibility of a project under the Community Bridge initiative. Fortunately for me JCasC ( Jenkins Configuration as Code) had the mentors as well as the project idea in place to start a project. After a few regular meetings we ironed out the details of the programme and on August 7th I began with my journey!\n\nJCasC Developer Tools — JSON Schema\n\nJSON files when submitted to a server undergo a validation to determine whether the values and the format are correct and that they conform to a well defined schema, this schema is known as a JSON Schema. A YAML file can also be validated using a JSON Schema.\nThe main premise of JCasC is to load YAML files written by developers into the Jenkins instance. An example of a JCasC YAML file is:\n\n---\njenkins:\n systemMessage: “Hello World”\n numExecutors:2\n ---\n\nThe above YAML configuration will configure Jenkins to display a message Hello world with the number of executors set to two. In order to validate the YAML we have a schema. This schema is written using jelly files (Executable XML files) and currently it is not a valid schema. The first phase of the project is based around rewriting the schema generation to java and developing a better test framework for it, because currently the schema is not testable.\n\nPhase 1 — JCasC Dev Tools\n\nThe first week I got into studying how the schema was generated.With the support of two of my awesome mentors Tim Jacomb and Joseph Peterson\nI finally got an understanding of the current schema.\nSo JCasC has a set of configurators for describing a YAML file.\nThey are:\na) Base Configurators\nb) Hetero Describable Configurators\nc) Data Bound Configurators\nThese configurators together successfully describe a YAML file.\nWe proceeded to generate the schema with the help of individual description of each of these configurators.\nThe JSON Schema has a set of components, consider the above yaml file as an example:\n\n---\n{\n  \"jenkins\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"systemMessage\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"numExecutors\": {\n        \"type\": \"integer\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n---\n\nSo here Jenkins is the base configurator and it has a set of attributes viz systemMessage and numExecutors, so our schema needs to be able to describe a set of attributes for every field in the schema. Some of the fields that our JSON Schema uses to describe the YAML are:\n\n1) type : String, int, Boolean etc.\n\n2) properties : A set of fields describing the part field.\n\n3) id: Unique Identifier for the field\nThus the above schema successfully verifies the YAML configuration.\n\nJAVA Rewrite\n\nWe used JSON Objects to build components of the schema.The basic flow that is followed to generate the schema is as follows:\n\na) Iterate through the Base Configurators.\n\nb) Iterate over the list of Base Configurator.Attributes and add each attribute to the schema.\n\nc) Iterate over the HeteroDescribable Configurators and add each configurator to the schema along with its required properties.\n\nThe set of PR’s Resolved during Phase 1 are as follows:\n\na) Basic Schema\n\nb) Schema Doc Page\n\nc) Test Framework\n\nd) Nested Schema\n\nThat is all from me guys, I am currently preparing for phase 2 and working towards fixing any pending issues of Phase 1. Thanks for reading.\n\nPhase 2 Goals:\n\nWe would primarily target VSCode integration in phase 2 with the aim of:\n\na)Validation of JCasC YAML files with the schema\n\nb)Autocompletion\n\nc)Integration with a live Jenkins instance.\n\nContributions\n\nWe would love to get feedback from you on the stuff we are working on. Contributions to the project would be highly appreciated.\n\na) Gitter Chat\n\nb) Github Repository\n\nc) Project Introduction","title":"JCasC Community Bridge Dev Tools - Phase 1","tags":["community-bridge","JCasC","VSCode","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"sladyn98","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sladyn is a Computer Science student at Mumbai University, India.\nHe is participating in Community Bridge 2019 to provide development tools to JCasC plugin in the form of IDE integrations, schema architecture improvements and configuration extension points <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin\">Configuration as Code Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"sladyn98","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sladyn Nunes","slug":"/blog/author/sladyn98","twitter":"SladynN"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"352e9ec4-8e30-52da-98d7-ee02d21defd4","slug":"/blog/2019/10/01/hacktoberfest/","strippedHtml":"Once again, Hacktoberfest is back!\nDuring this October event, everyone can support open-source by contributing changes, and can earn limited edition swag.\nWe invite you to contribute to Jenkins, regardless of your experience and background.\nYou can write code, improve documentation and design, localize Jenkins or create new artwork.\nAny GitHub pull request counts!\n\nQuick start\n\nSign-up to Hacktoberfest on the event website.\n\nJoin our Gitter channel.\n\nEverything is set, just start creating pull-requests!\n\nThis year Hacktoberfest does not require labeling pull requests,\nbut please mention Hacktoberfest in your pull requests for faster reviews\n(see FAQ: Marking Pull requests)\n\nSee the details below.\n\nHow to contribute?\n\nThere are many ways to\ncontribute to Jenkins.\nIt is not just about code, any pull request in GitHub counts towards the Hacktoberfest goal.\n\nCode - Contribute to the code or automated tests.\nWe have components written in Java, JavasScript, Groovy, Go, Ruby and other languages.\n\nWrite - Improve documentation, write blogposts, create tutorials or solution pages\n\nLocalize - Help us to Localize Jenkins to other languages\n\nDesign - artwork and UI improvements also count!\n\nOrganize - Organize a local meetup for Jenkins & Hacktoberfest (see our event kit)\n\nSpread the word - Share your accomplishments in social media using the #hacktoberfest and #jenkinsci hashtags\n(or CC @jenkinsci in Twitter).\n\nWhere to contribute?\n\nThe Jenkins project is spread across multiple organizations on GitHub (jenkinsci, jenkins-infra, jenkins-zh).\nYou are welcome to contribute to any repository in any of these organizations,\nor to any other Jenkins-related repository on GitHub.\nIf you adopt Jenkins in your own open-source projects (e.g. Jenkins Pipeline or Configuration as Code),\nit counts as well!

then they can use the Maven plugin for generating the audit event classes for use in the plugin.\n\nThe other major feature of this plugin is configuring where to output these audit logs.\nBy default, audit logs will be written in HTML files (rotated once per day) to $JENKINS_HOME/logs/html/audit.html which are viewable through the \"Audit Logs\" root action link.\nIn the system settings, a section for audit logging is added where the main audit log output can be configured.\nThis can initially be configured to output via either a JSON log file in $JENKINS_HOME/logs/audit.log by default or to a syslog server using RFC5424 encoding.\n\nOverall, this experience has been rather interesting.\nBesides having an opportunity to mentor new contributors, Outreachy has helped open my eyes to the struggles that developers from around the world are dealing with which can be improved upon to help expand our communities.\nFor example, many countries do not have reliable internet or electricity, so the use of synchronous videoconferencing and other heavyweight, synchronous processes common to more corporate-style development are inadequate in this international context.\nThis doesn’t even begin to account for the difference in timezones which is not always an issue, though both problems are addressable by using asynchronous communication methods like chat and email.\nThis notion of asynchronous communication is an important aspect of the Apache Way, for example, which emphasises processes that allow for vendor neutral communities to form and thrive around a project.\n\nThis mentoring project was valuable to myself as well.\nAs a software engineer myself, project management is not my specialty, so this gave me a great opportunity to develop my own PM skills and technical leadership.\nMy own typical discovery process for feature development involves experimenting directly with the code to see what features make sense to prioritize and which would take a vast effort to implement.\nChanging my own discovery process to avoid implementing the features myself was difficult to adjust to, though I did defer any of my own feature contributions to this plugin until after the initial release.\nIn order to appropriately scope the project, I still had to spend a bit of time reading through the Jenkins codebase to determine which tasks could be implemented simply (e.g., good newbie-friendly issues), which tasks might require changes to Jenkins itself (previously discovered to take too long for these relatively short Outreachy rounds), and which tasks would require intimate familiarity with Jenkins and would likely be infeasible for new developers to Jenkins.\nThanks to the work done in discovery and delivery, I’ve also identified potential features for Log4j itself which could be used in future versions of this plugin.\n\nOverall, I think we did a good job of balancing the scope of this project without spending too much time in any specific area.\nThe first release of this plugin is now available in the Jenkins Update Center.\nIn the future, I hope to learn more about developing Jenkins UI components so that we can create a more dynamic and Jenkins-like configuration page for choosing where logs are output.\nWhile I don’t intend on using this plugin for further Outreachy rounds, I do hope to see more interest in it over time as the more security-conscious users out there discover this new plugin.","title":"Audit Log Plugin for Jenkins Releases 1.0","tags":["outreachy","logging","security","plugin","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":"https://musigma.blog/","github":"jvz","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Mathematician, software engineer, and free software evangelist.\nWorks for CloudBees on the <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/security/\">Jenkins Security Team</a> along with other Jenkins community work since 2018.\nPMC Chair of the <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/\">Apache Logging Services project</a> and Secretary for the <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/\">Apache Software Foundation</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"jvz","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Matt Sicker","slug":"/blog/author/jvz","twitter":"jvz"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d12bee04-3e3b-5a23-9775-d800d9abf794","slug":"/blog/2019/08/25/jenkinsworld-contrib-summit-ask-the-expert-booth/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins turns 15 years old!\nJenkins World brings together DevOps thought leaders, IT executives, continuous delivery practitioners and the Jenkins\ncommunity and ecosystem in one global event, providing attendees with the opportunity to learn, explore, network\nface-to-face and help shape the next evolution of Jenkins development and solutions for DevOps.\n\nThere is also the Jenkins Contributor Summit in San Francisco. The Jenkins Contributor Summit is the place where\ncurrent and future contributors get together to discuss, learn and collaborate on the latest and greatest efforts within\nJenkins project. The morning portion of the summit is a mix of presentations by the core contributors. The\npresentations highlight what each effort is about and what community members can do to help. In the\nafternoon breakout sessions with  Birds of a Feather tables for in-depth discussion, and collaboration with sub-project\ncontributors.\n\nI feel very honored to have been a part of this.\n\nDay 1\n\nDay one started with the contributor summit. This was a chance for everyone to get together and talk about\ncontributions and put faces to names. Most people I had only met via video chat or on gitter so I was super excited.\nWe gathered to hear about the start of the Jenkins open source landscape.\n\nNext up was the BoF/Unconference. I was leading these sessions and I felt they went really well.\nWe had fellow org admins Martin d’Anjou and Jeff Pearce give a talk about Google Summer of Code projects.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code student Natasha Stopa presented her project, Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool. This is\na super cool project and very well received in the community.\n\nWe closed out the session with a presentation from Steven Terrana from Booz Allen Hamilton and the awesome Jenkins\nTemplating Engine.

There is a lot of marketing data regarding the increased usage of\nKubernetes but I was seriously surprised by the massive interest in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nOf course there were opportunities for selfie requests.\n\nLunch time demos got underway and we had a busy schedule.\nFirst up was the awesome Mark Waite to talk about the\nGit plugin. A lot of people use git in\nJenkins.\nThank you so much for all that you do Mark.\n\nJenkins org admin Martin d’Anjou was next on deck to talk about the Google Summer of Code. So amazing to think that the\nGoogle Summer of Code is also in its 15th year like Jenkins!\n\nNatasha Stopa is a Google Summer of Code student and she presented her project Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool.\nNatasha really put a lot of hard work in to this plugin and it was really awesome to see the turn out and support during\nher presentation.\n\nFinally there was me. I presented the Sysdig Secure Scanning Jenkins plugin which I am a maintainer of. I thank everyone who attended\n\nRight after the lunch time demos I also oversaw the Jenkins open space. This was an opportunity for the community to talk\nabout items and let them flow organically. I really enjoyed this session and felt it was also well received.\n\nWe closed out the day and the event with a picture of some of the Jenkins org admins and Google Summer of Code students.\nMissing from this photos are fellow org admins, Lloyd Chang and Oleg Nenashev\n\nClosing\n\nThis was an amazing experience.
