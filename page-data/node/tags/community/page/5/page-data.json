There will be no user-focused topics (no presentations, no trainings, etc.) but we will focus on defining key priorities for the project, building a roadmap and resolving issues we have in the project at the moment.\nWe’ll end up the day with our now traditional Orval and flemish beef stew at Le Roy d’Espagne\n\nFinally the FOSDEM, the 01 and 02 of February, we’ll all be at FOSDEM.

project congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!\nLet’s take a look at some changes this year.\n\nHighlights\n\nWe celebrated 15 years of Jenkins\n\nWe had first ever Governance Board and Officer elections\n\nJenkins project joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)\n\nWe released Java 11 support in Jenkins\n\nJenkins X has graduated as a Jenkins sub-project and became a new project under umbrella of CDF\n\nIn October 2019 we reached the record high number of contributions: 915 unique contributors, 124 of them were first-timers\n\nWe started new special interest groups for Documentation and User Experience.\n\nA new position of the Documentation officer was introduced to highlight an important role of documentation in the project\n\nWe ran multiple mentorship programs with 12 mentees in total: Google Summer of Code, Hacktoberfest and Outreachy\n\nIf you are interested to know more about Jenkins features introduced in 2019,\nstay tuned for a separate blog post about it (coming soon!).\n\nProject updates\n\nHighlights above do not cover all advancements we had in the project.\nBelow you can find slides from the Jenkins contributor summit in Lisbon.\nThere we had project updates by officers, SIG and sub-project leaders.\nSee the slide deck to know about: Jenkins Core, Pipeline, Configuration-as-Code, Security, UX Overhaul, Jenkins Infrastructure, platform support and documentation.\n\nSome stats and numbers\n\nIf this section seems to be too long for you, here is some infographic prepared by Tracy Miranda.\nAs you may see, Jenkins is pretty big :)\n\nCommunity.\nOver the past year we had 5433 contributors in GitHub repositories (committers, reviewers, issue submitters, etc.).\nWe had 1892 unique committers who created 7122 pull requests and 45484 commits, bots excluded.\nContributors represent 273 companies and 111 countries, 8% of contributors are recognized as independent.\nThe most active repositories were Jenkins Core and jenkins.io.\nThe most active month was October 2019 when we reached the record high number of contributions: 915 unique contributors, 124 of them were first-timers, thanks to Hacktoberfest!.\n\nJenkins core.\nIn 2019 Jenkins core had 54 weekly and 13 LTS releases with several hundreds of notable fixes/enhancements.\nThere was a login screen extensibility rework, many update manager and administrative monitors improvements.\nWe also introduced support for user timezones, not speaking of emojis support 🥳.\nThere was also a lot of housekeeping work: better APIs, codebase refresh, cleaning up static analysis warnings and removing deprecated features like Remoting CLI.\nThe core’s components also got major updates.\nOnly Jenkins Remoting got 11 releases with stability improvements and new features like support of inbound connections to headless Jenkins controllers.\nThere are also major incoming features like jep:222[WebSocket Services support], UI look&feel updates, jira:JENKINS-12548[Readonly system configuration support], Docker images for new platforms like Arm.\nTo facilitate further changes we created a new Core pull request reviewers team and added 9 contributors there.\n\nPlugins.\nThere were 2654 plugin releases, and 157 NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.\nJenkins ecosystem got a lot of new integrations with Development and DevOps tools.\nAlso, warm welcome back to the Scriptler Plugin which was depublished in 2017 due to security issues.\nIf you are afraid about such plugin numbers and dependency management, there is a new Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool which should help Jenkins users to manage plugins more efficiently.\n\nSecurity.\nIt was a hot year for the Jenkins Security Team.\nThere were 5 security advisories for the core and 20 - for plugins.\nIn total we disclosed 288 vulnerabilities across the project, including some backlog cleaning for unmaintained plugins.\nScript Security Plugin was the hottest plugin with 10 critical fixes addressing various sandbox bypass vulnerabilities.\nPlain text storage and unprotected credentials were the most popular vulnerability type 120 disclosures in 2019.\nIt was made possible by hundreds of reports submitted by contributors after code surveys,\nspecial thanks to Viktor Gazdag who reported the most of the issues and became the Jenkins 2019 Security MVP (check out his story here).\n\nInfrastructure.\nGot Jenkins? If so, you rely on Jenkins update centers, website and issue tracker.\nAll these and many other services are maintained by the Jenkins Infrastructure Team.\nThis year the team handled more than 400 requests in the bugtracker, and many other informal requests.\nIn total, more than 30 people contributed to Jenkins infrastructure this year (website content is excluded).\nWe also deployed 4 new services, migrated 7 services from Azure Container Service to Azure Kubernetes Service and updated many other services.\nMore changes will happen in the next months, and we are looking for new INFRA team members!\n\nDocumentation.\nOnly last quarter we had 178 contributors to Jenkins documentation. It includes jenkins.io and other documentation hosted on GitHub, Wiki is not included.\nThere is also ongoing migration plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub ( announcement).\nSince the beginning of the project in Sep 2019, more than 150 plugin were migrated, and they got significant documentation revamp during the migration.\nYou can see the current status here.\nWe also work on introducing changelog automation in the project.\n123 plugins have already adopted the new changelog tools, powered by Release Drafter.\nAlso, we had more than 60 technical blog posts published on jenkins.io.\n\nConfiguration as Code was one of the most popular areas this year.\nJenkins Configuration as Code Plugin had more than 30 releases with new features and bug fixes.\nMore than 50 plugins have been also updated in order to offer better configuration-as-code support.\nAs a result, the JCasC Plugin got massive adoption this year (from 2000 to almost 8000 installations),\nand now it becomes a de-facto standard for managing Jenkins as code.\nThis year we also ran our very first CommunityBridge project devoted to JCasC Schema validation and developer tools.\n\nEvents and outreach programs.\nIn 2019 we participated in multiple conferences, including FOSDEM, DevOps World | Jenkins World, SCALE.\nMore than 40 Jenkins Area Meetups were organized across the world, and there were many other meetups devoted to Jenkins.\nWe also kept expanding our outreach programs.\nIn total we had 12 students who participated in Google Summer of Code, Outreachy and newly introduced Community Bridge.\nWe also had the biggest ever Hacktoberfest with 664 pull requests and 102 participants.\nThese outreach programs help us to deliver new features in Jenkins.\nFor example, this year we added Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab and a new Plugin Installation Manager Tool during GSoC,\nand Outreachy resulted in a new Audit Log Plugin.\n\nWhere did we get those stats?\nGitHub stats came from the CDF DevStats service.\nThese stats include all repositories in the jenkinsci organization and most popular repositories in jenkins-infra, Jenkins X and other organizations/repositories within the project are not included.\nOther stats came from project reports, component changelogs, Jenkins usage statistics service, plugin releases history.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nYear 2020 will be pretty busy for the Jenkins project.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want the project to succeed.\nAs it was written Board elections blogpost,\nthere are many areas to consider: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nIn the coming months there will be a lot of discussions in mailing lists and special interest groups,\nand we invite all teams to work on their roadmaps and to communicate them in the community.\n\nNext month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a Jenkins stand there.\nOn January 31st we will also host a traditional contributor summit in Brussels,\nwhere we will talk about next steps for the project, in terms of technical roadmaps and the project governance.\nIf you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join us at the summit!\nSee this thread for more information.\n\nWe also plan to continue all outreach programs.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement),\nand we will be also interested to consider non-coding projects as a part of other programs like CommunityBridge.\nWe also work on improving contribution guidelines for newcomers and expert contributors.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day.\nWe are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size.\nEverything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc.\nTHANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!","title":"Happy New Year!

Note that this list is subject to change.\n\nWhat does mentoring involve?\n\nPotential mentors are invited to read the information for mentors.\nNote that being a GSoC mentor does not require expert knowledge of Jenkins.\nMentors do not work alone. We make sure that every project has at least two mentors.\nGSoC org admins will help to find technical advisers, so you can study together with your students.\n\nMentoring takes about 5 to 8 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).\nMentors provide guidance, coaching, and sometimes a bit of cheerleading.\nThey review student proposals, pull-requests and the students presentations\nat the evaluation phase.\nThey fill in the Google provided evaluation report form at the end of coding periods.\n\nWhat do you get in exchange?\n\nIn return of mentoring, a student works on your project full time for four months.\nThink about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but never had the time…​\n\nHaving a mentoring opportunity also means that you get to improve your management and people skills.\n\nAs well, up to two mentors per organization are eligible to participate in the Google Mentor Summit taking place each year.\nThe Jenkins Org Admins try to send different mentors each year.\nIt is also possible to win an additional seat at the summit in the \"last minute draw\"\n(Google draws mentors at random to fill the cancellations and empty seats).\n\nSee this post from one of the 2019 mentors\non the kind of experience this was.\n\nGSoC is a pretty good return on the investment!\n\nFor any question, you can find the GSoC Org Admins,\nmentors and participants on the GSoC SIG Gitter chat.","title":"Google Summer of Code 2020 call for Project ideas and Mentors","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2020","community","events","developer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#7898d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/7b80f/martinda.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/4c2a5/martinda.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/8bef2/martinda.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/7b80f/martinda.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/2864c/martinda.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/5abcf/martinda.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/410d2/martinda.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/6f814/martinda.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/54282c2d627080ad398fbe9d5907bbf1/ca864/martinda.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":136}}},"blog":null,"github":"martinda","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Martin is a Jenkins community member.

Tyler Croy on the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nDaniel Beck was elected as Security Officer\n\nAlyssa Tong was elected as Events Officer\n\nNominations for Infrastructure, Release and Documentation officer positions were uncontested.\n\nOlivier Vernin was elected as Infrastructure Officer (uncontested)\n\nOliver Gondža was elected as Release Officer (uncontested)\n\nMark Waite was elected as Documentation Officer (uncontested)\n\nIf you are interested to learn more, please see the blog post below.\n\nBoard election details\n\nThe voting results are:\n\nOleg Nenashev (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nMark Waite loses to Oleg Nenashev by 181–127\n\nUllrich Hafner loses to Oleg Nenashev by 198–115, loses to Mark Waite by 171–133\n\nAlex Earl loses to Oleg Nenashev by 225–82, loses to Ullrich Hafner by 168–128\n\nOliver Gondža loses to Oleg Nenashev by 227–76, loses to Alex Earl by 151–136\n\nZhao Xiaojie (aka Rick) loses to Oleg Nenashev by 233–82, loses to Oliver Gondža by 160–131\n\nAlthough Mark Waite came second in the voting results, being on the board would violate the Corporate Involvement clause which states that \"the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%\".\nBased on that rule, the third seat Alex Earl will join the Jenkins board.\nAt the same time, Mark Waite will take the newly introduced role of Documentation officer.\n\nAll new board members are elected for a 2-year term, unless they step down earlier.\nThe estimated end of term for them is December 02, 2021.\nThe actual date will depend on the election schedule in 2021.\n\nOfficer election details\n\nWe have reelected all 5 officers for the new 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2020.\n\nAlyssa Tong won the biggest support as an Events officer ( voting results)\n\nDaniel Beck won the biggest support as a Security officer ( voting results)\n\nWhen an officer position has only one candidate that is willing to accept the nomination, there is no reason to vote on that position.\nThis year some nominees declined the nominations before the election happened, and 3 officer nominations were finally uncontested:\nOlivier Vernin - infrastructure officer,\nOliver Gondža - release officer,\nMark Waite - documentation officer.\n\nStatistics\n\nHere are some voting stats from these elections:\n\nTotal number of eligible accounts: 91,015\n\nTotal number of registered voters: 831\n\nTotal number of votes: 343\n\nThis election was hosted on the Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS).\nWhile preparing for the elections, we discovered that CIVS is unable to support our large number of eligible voters.\nWe created a voter registration system to identify voters and then registered those voters with CIVS.\nThe workaround required a slight voting delay.\nSpecial thanks to Olivier Vernin and Tracy Miranda who made it possible!\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nIn short term, the renewed board will focus on running the Jenkins governance processes (meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining next steps towards improving the project.\nOne of the priorities will be to organize knowledge and permission transfers to new board members so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThere are also pending activities like Jenkins' transition to Continuous Delivery Foundation which require attention from board members.\n\nFor longer term, there are some ideas floating around:\n  roadmap for key components,\n  long-anticipated architecture changes (UX revamp, pluggable storage, cloud native Jenkins),\n  adopting Linux Foundation best practices like Core Infrastructure Initiative,\n  contributor onboarding,\n  etc.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for further evolvement of the Jenkins project,\nand the board could help to facilitate them in the community.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to do so!\n\nFeedback\n\nWe will also also plan to conduct a public retrospective at one of the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meetings.\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process.\nPlease use the following channels for feedback and suggestions:\n\nThere is a Retrospective document in Google Docs.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\n\nFor ideas about the project improvements and next steps for the board,\nplease use the Jenkins Developers mailing list.\n\nFor private feedback, please send an email to the Jenkins Board or to Tracy Miranda.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2019 election announcement\n\n2019 election updates on Nov 08\n\nRetrospective

This was great\nand I wanted to share in hopes of encouraging more people to join.\nYou can learn more about the Google Summer of Code here: https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/\n\nCommunity Bonding\n\nThe first phase of the project is the community bonding phase. This is where the student and other mentors come together\nto lay out the plan for the project. It is important to set expectations and ensure that the student is well aware of\nwhat will take place and also made to feel welcome.\n\nParichay Barpanda was the student and he was super awesome from the get go. The project he was working on was the Gitlab\nBranch Source Plugin. More can be found here: jenkinsci/gitlab-branch-source-plugin\n\nFrom the mentor side it was myself and Justin Harringa. Justin was just amazing throughout this project and I seriously\ncould not have done this without him. He was encouraging, empathetic and just all around great. I would gladly serve\nwith him again.\n\nWe laid out our plan and guidance and got to work.\n\nFirst Evaluations\n\nThe first evaluation was quickly upon us and Parichay was ready!\nThe work he put in was nothing shy of amazing. We did our 1st demo and he really rocked it. A video of that demo can be\nfound on : Youtube\n\nSecond Evaluations\n\nThere was not much time to rest before we realized that phase II end was upon us but Parichay was ready. Again, he\nnailed it.\n\nThat demo can be found here\n\nMentors Submit Final Evaluations\n\nWe had our final evaluation and at this point Parichay was seasoned. He was getting issues assigned to him, working on\nlittle bug fixes and setting his roadmap for features. He absolutely blew Justin and I away.\n\nParichay’s final evaluation demo can be seen here\n\nAt the conclusion of the final demo’s, Justin and I met and went over Parichay’s final evaluation. At this point we had\nmet twice a week for several months, we have reviewed code daily, we had community involvement and most of all we had\nseen Parichay grow into a seasoned software developer.\n\nJustin and I were without a doubt passing Parichay on his entire body of work. I am actually tearing up typing this\nbecause I am so proud of Parichay.\n\nOrg Admin\n\nBeing an org admin for the 2019 Google Summer of Code project for the Jenkins organization was truly rewarding and couldn’t\nhave been accomplished without the help from Oleg Nenashev, Martin d’Anjou, Jeff Pearce and Lloyd Chang.\n\nAs an org admin we handled issues with mentors, community members and disagreements involving work. These items were only\na few and as a team we handled them accordingly.\n\nWe regularly met to discuss and plan. Coordinating and dealing with a project like Google Summer of Code is no small feat\nbut this team made it super easy and I am so thankful for them and all that I learned.\n\nClosing\n\nIn looking back at this experience I am so grateful for the opportunity I was given. This was such a rewarding experience\nto not only be able to mentor but also be an org admin. Not only will I be back next year (we are already in the\nplanning stages) but I highly encourage people reading this to consider joining. You will not be disappointed.\n\nI am so thankful for all the students, mentors and fellow org admins. Your dedication to open source is so valued. You\nshowed and continue to show what this project is all about, and that is being welcoming, open and transparent. Helping\npeople grow as individuals while learning skills is what I love about this community.\n\nThank you to everyone and I hope your futures are bright!","title":"Google Summer of Code Mentor and Org Admin Perspective","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2019","jenkins","community","events","mentor"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

I came across this initiative in a blog post. I had been contributing to Jenkins at the time and decided to have a chat with Oleg Nenashev and Tracy Miranda regarding the possibility of a project under the Community Bridge initiative. Fortunately for me JCasC ( Jenkins Configuration as Code) had the mentors as well as the project idea in place to start a project. After a few regular meetings we ironed out the details of the programme and on August 7th I began with my journey!\n\nJCasC Developer Tools — JSON Schema\n\nJSON files when submitted to a server undergo a validation to determine whether the values and the format are correct and that they conform to a well defined schema, this schema is known as a JSON Schema. A YAML file can also be validated using a JSON Schema.\nThe main premise of JCasC is to load YAML files written by developers into the Jenkins instance. An example of a JCasC YAML file is:\n\n---\njenkins:\n systemMessage: “Hello World”\n numExecutors:2\n ---\n\nThe above YAML configuration will configure Jenkins to display a message Hello world with the number of executors set to two. In order to validate the YAML we have a schema. This schema is written using jelly files (Executable XML files) and currently it is not a valid schema. The first phase of the project is based around rewriting the schema generation to java and developing a better test framework for it, because currently the schema is not testable.\n\nPhase 1 — JCasC Dev Tools\n\nThe first week I got into studying how the schema was generated.With the support of two of my awesome mentors Tim Jacomb and Joseph Peterson\nI finally got an understanding of the current schema.\nSo JCasC has a set of configurators for describing a YAML file.\nThey are:\na) Base Configurators\nb) Hetero Describable Configurators\nc) Data Bound Configurators\nThese configurators together successfully describe a YAML file.\nWe proceeded to generate the schema with the help of individual description of each of these configurators.\nThe JSON Schema has a set of components, consider the above yaml file as an example:\n\n---\n{\n  \"jenkins\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"systemMessage\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"numExecutors\": {\n        \"type\": \"integer\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n---\n\nSo here Jenkins is the base configurator and it has a set of attributes viz systemMessage and numExecutors, so our schema needs to be able to describe a set of attributes for every field in the schema. Some of the fields that our JSON Schema uses to describe the YAML are:\n\n1) type : String, int, Boolean etc.\n\n2) properties : A set of fields describing the part field.\n\n3) id: Unique Identifier for the field\nThus the above schema successfully verifies the YAML configuration.\n\nJAVA Rewrite\n\nWe used JSON Objects to build components of the schema.The basic flow that is followed to generate the schema is as follows:\n\na) Iterate through the Base Configurators.\n\nb) Iterate over the list of Base Configurator.Attributes and add each attribute to the schema.\n\nc) Iterate over the HeteroDescribable Configurators and add each configurator to the schema along with its required properties.\n\nThe set of PR’s Resolved during Phase 1 are as follows:\n\na) Basic Schema\n\nb) Schema Doc Page\n\nc) Test Framework\n\nd) Nested Schema\n\nThat is all from me guys, I am currently preparing for phase 2 and working towards fixing any pending issues of Phase 1. Thanks for reading.\n\nPhase 2 Goals:\n\nWe would primarily target VSCode integration in phase 2 with the aim of:\n\na)Validation of JCasC YAML files with the schema\n\nb)Autocompletion\n\nc)Integration with a live Jenkins instance.\n\nContributions\n\nWe would love to get feedback from you on the stuff we are working on. Contributions to the project would be highly appreciated.\n\na) Gitter Chat\n\nb) Github Repository\n\nc) Project Introduction","title":"JCasC Community Bridge Dev Tools - Phase 1","tags":["community-bridge","JCasC","VSCode","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"sladyn98","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sladyn is a Computer Science student at Mumbai University, India.\nHe is participating in Community Bridge 2019 to provide development tools to JCasC plugin in the form of IDE integrations, schema architecture improvements and configuration extension points <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin\">Configuration as Code Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"sladyn98","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Sladyn Nunes","slug":"/blog/authors/sladyn98","twitter":"SladynN"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"352e9ec4-8e30-52da-98d7-ee02d21defd4","slug":"/blog/2019/10/01/hacktoberfest/","strippedHtml":"Once again, Hacktoberfest is back!\nDuring this October event, everyone can support open-source by contributing changes, and can earn limited edition swag.\nWe invite you to contribute to Jenkins, regardless of your experience and background.\nYou can write code, improve documentation and design, localize Jenkins or create new artwork.\nAny GitHub pull request counts!\n\nQuick start\n\nSign-up to Hacktoberfest on the event website.\n\nJoin our Gitter channel.\n\nEverything is set, just start creating pull-requests!\n\nThis year Hacktoberfest does not require labeling pull requests,\nbut please mention Hacktoberfest in your pull requests for faster reviews\n(see FAQ: Marking Pull requests)\n\nSee the details below.\n\nHow to contribute?\n\nThere are many ways to\ncontribute to Jenkins.\nIt is not just about code, any pull request in GitHub counts towards the Hacktoberfest goal.\n\nCode - Contribute to the code or automated tests.\nWe have components written in Java, JavasScript, Groovy, Go, Ruby and other languages.\n\nWrite - Improve documentation, write blogposts, create tutorials or solution pages\n\nLocalize - Help us to Localize Jenkins to other languages\n\nDesign - artwork and UI improvements also count!\n\nOrganize - Organize a local meetup for Jenkins & Hacktoberfest (see our event kit)\n\nSpread the word - Share your accomplishments in social media using the #hacktoberfest and #jenkinsci hashtags\n(or CC @jenkinsci in Twitter).\n\nWhere to contribute?\n\nThe Jenkins project is spread across multiple organizations on GitHub (jenkinsci, jenkins-infra, jenkins-zh).\nYou are welcome to contribute to any repository in any of these organizations,\nor to any other Jenkins-related repository on GitHub.\nIf you adopt Jenkins in your own open-source projects (e.g. Jenkins Pipeline or Configuration as Code),\nit counts as well!
