However, I had never been able to engage in an open-source project as a\ncontributor, until now.\n\nSince I made my first—​ridiculously simple—​commit into Jenkins, six months ago (in September, 2018), I have been\nattempting to contribute more to the Jenkins project. However, contributing to open-source projects is, in general,\nchallenging. Especially to long-lived projects, with a lot of history, legacy code and tribal knowledge. It is often\ndifficult to know where to start and also difficult to come up with a plan to keep moving forward and contributing\nregularly, and in more meaningful ways over time.\n\nWhen it comes to the Jenkins project, I have encountered challenges that others trying to get into the community are\nlikely to encounter. For that reason, I have decided to go ahead and share my journey of becoming a more engaged Jenkins\ncontributor.\n\nI plan to publish roughly 1 post per month, describing this journey. I will attempt to start contributing to the pieces\nthat are easier to start with, transitioning towards more complex contributions over time.\n\nWhere to start\n\njenkins.io\n\nTo become a Jenkins contributor, the most obvious place to start looking at is jenkins.io. In the\ntop navbar there is a Community dropdown, with several links to different sections. The first entry,\nOverview, takes us to the “Participate and contribute” section.\n\nIn this section we get lots of information about the many ways in which we can engage with the Jenkins project and\ncommunity. Even though the intention is to display all the possible options, allowing the reader to choose, it can feel\na bit overwhelming.\n\nThe page is divided into two columns, the column on the left shows the different options to participate, while the\ncolumn on the right shows the different options to contribute.\n\nSuggestions to Participate\n\nIn the left column of the “Participate and contribute” page, there are several ideas on how to engage with the community,\nranging from communicating to reviewing changes or providing feedback.\n\nOne of the pieces that got me confused at first in this area were the communication channels. There are many different\nchannels for communication. There are several mailing lists and there are also IRC\nand Gitter channels.\n\nDuring my first attempts to get involved, I subscribed to many of the mailing lists and several IRC and Gitter channels,\nbut I quickly noticed that there is significant communication going on; and that most threads in the most active lists\nand channels are specific to issues users or developers have. So, unless your goal is to support other users right away\n(if you are an experienced Jenkins user already it might be the case) or you plan to ask questions that you already\nhave in mind, I would advise against spending too much time on this at first.\n\nEven though it is great to see how the community members support each other, the amount of communication might be\noverwhelming for a newcomer, and if you are also trying to contribute to the project (either with translations,\ndocumentation or code), following these conversations might not be the best way to start.\n\nSuggestions to Contribute\n\nIn the right column of the “Participate and contribute” page there are several ideas on how to contribute, mostly\ngrouped into: writing code, translating, documenting and testing.\n\nIn following posts, I will be going through all of these types of contributions, as well as through some of the\nsuggestions to participate, which include reviewing Pull Requests (PRs) or providing feedback (either reporting new\nissues or replicating cases other users have already described, providing additional information to help the maintainer\nreproduce and fix them).\n\nMy first contribution in this journey\n\nWhen looking at the “Participate and contribute” page, I noticed a couple of things in that page that I could help\nimprove. And I was actually planning to pick one of those as the first example of a contribution for this post. But\nwhen I was reading the contributing guidelines of the repository, I found an even easier contribution I could make,\nwhich I thought would be a great example to illustrate how simple it could be to start contributing. So I decided to go\nahead with it.\n\nThe website repository\n\nIn the ”Document” section there is a link to the\ncontributing guidelines of the jenkins.io repository.\nThe CONTRIBUTING file is a common file present in the root folder of most open-source-project repositories.\n\nFollowing the link to that file, I reached the jenkins.io repository, which is the one that contains the sources for\nthe corresponding website—​which also includes this blog. And, in fact, the contributing file was the first file I\nwanted to review, in order to learn more about how to contribute to the website.\n\nFound a broken link\n\nWhen reading the contributing file, I learned about the Awestruct static site generator, which is the tool used to\ntransform the AsciiDoc source files in the repo into a website. However, when I clicked the link to learn more about it, I noticed it was broken. The domain had expired.\n\nWhy not fix it?\n\nThis was the opportunity I chose to show other newcomers how easy it can be to start contributing.\n\nForking the repository\n\nThe first step, as usual, would be to fork the repository and clone it to my machine.\n\nApplying the change\n\nThe next step would be to apply the change to the corresponding file. To do so, I created a new branch\n“alternative-awestruct-link” and applied the change there:\n\nMaking sure everything builds correctly and tests pass\n\nEven though in this case my contribution was not to the actual website, but to the contributing guidelines (and for\nthat reason was unlikely to break anything), it is a best practice to get used to the regular process every\ncontribution should follow, making sure everything builds correctly after any change.\n\nAs stated in the contributing guidelines themselves, in order to build this repository we just have to run the default\n“make” target, in the root of the repository.\n\nOnce the command execution finishes, if everything looks good, we are ready to go to the next step: creating the PR.\n\nCreating the PR\n\nOnce my change had been committed and pushed to my repository, I just had to create the PR. We have an easy way to do so\nby just clicking the link that we get in our git logs once the push is completed, although we can create the PR directly\nthrough the GitHub UI, if we prefer so; or even use “hub”, the GitHub CLI, to do it.\n\nIn this case, I just clicked the link, which took me to the PR creation page on GitHub. Once there, I added a\ndescription and created the PR.\n\nWhen a PR to this repository is created, we notice there are some checks that start running. Jenkins repositories are\nconfigured to notify the “Jenkins on Jenkins”, which runs the corresponding CI pipelines for\neach repository, as described in the corresponding Jenkinsfile.\n\nOnce the checks are completed, we can see the result in the PR:\n\nAnd if we want to see the details of the execution, we can follow the “Show all checks” link:\n\nPR Review\n\nNow that the PR has been created and all automated checks are passing, we only have to wait for peer code reviews.\n\nOnce someone approves the PR and it is later merged, your contribution is integrated into the master branch of the\nrepository, becoming part of the next release.\n\nI have contributed!\n\nThis contribution I made is a trivial one, with very little complexity and it might not be the most interesting one if\nyou are trying to contribute code to the Jenkins project itself.\n\nHowever, for me, as the contributor, it was a great way to get familiar with the repository, its contributing\nguidelines, the technology behind the jenkins.io website; and, above anything else, to start “losing the fear” of\ncontributing to an open source project like Jenkins.\n\nSo, if you are in the same position I was, do not hesitate. Go ahead and find your own first contribution. Every little\ncounts!","title":"The journey of becoming a Jenkins contributor: Introduction","tags":["jenkins","community","developer","contributing","newcomer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/ff5b9/romenrg.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/3af71/romenrg.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/1e7bb/romenrg.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/ff5b9/romenrg.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/7b60f/romenrg.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/bf13b/romenrg.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/9edd6/romenrg.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/f5f75/romenrg.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9662f4841febd48036eb9f74e29d97cc/ff962/romenrg.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":142}}},"blog":"https://www.romenrg.com","github":"romenrg","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Romén is a lifelong learner, software engineer and former digital entrepreneur.

The CDF believes in the power of Continuous Delivery, and it aims to foster and sustain the ecosystem of open-source, vendor neutral projects.\n\nJenkins contributors have decided that our project should join this new foundation. This discussion happened over a period of time, with a relatively succinct summary of the motivation comes from here.\n\nNow, as a user, what does this mean?\n\nFirst, there will be no big disruption/discontinuity. The same people are still here, no URL is changing, releases will come out like they’ve always been. We will make the decisions the same way as we’ve been making, and pull requests land the same way. Changes will happen continuously over the period of time.\n\nThis is yet another testament to the maturity and the importance of the Jenkins project in this space. With a quarter million Jenkins running around the globe, it’s truly rocking the world of software development from IoT to games, cloud native webapps to machine learning projects. It makes Jenkins such an obvious, safe choice for anyone seeking open heterogeneous DevOps strategy.\n\nThe CDF creates a level playing field that is well-understood to organized contributors, which further, translate into more contributors, hence resulting in a better Jenkins, faster. Over the past years, the Jenkins project has been steadily growing more structures that provide this clarity, and this is the newest step on this trajectory.\n\nAny serious dev teams are combining multiple tools and services to cover the whole software development spectrum. A lot of work gets reinvented in those teams to integrate those tools together. Jenkins will be working more closely with other projects under the umbrella of the CDF, which would result in better aligned software with less overlap.\n\nOur users are practitioners trying to improve the software development process in their organizations. They get that CI/CD/automation which unlocks the productivity that their organizations need, but that’s not always obvious to their organizations as a whole. So our users often struggle to get the necessary support. The CDF will advocate for the practice of Continuous Delivery, and because it’s not coming from a vendor or a project, it will reach the people who can lend that support.\n\nSo I hope you can see why we are so excited about this!\n\nIn fact, for us, this is an idea that we’ve been cooking for close to two years. I don’t think I’m exaggerating much to say the whole idea of the CDF started from the Jenkins project.\n\nA lot of people have done so much work behind the scene to make this happen. But a few people played such instrumental roles that I have to personally thank them namely, Chris Aniszczyk for his patience and persistence, R. Tyler Croy for cooking and evolving the idea, and Tracy Miranda for bringing this idea into a reality.","title":"Jenkins is joining the Continuous Delivery

is a joint blog post prepared by the Java 11 Support Team: Adrien Lecharpentier, Ashton Treadway, Baptiste Mathus, Jenn Briden, Kevin Earls, María Isabel Vilacides, Mark Waite, Ramón León and Oleg Nenashev.\n\nWe have worked hard for this and it’s now here.\nWe are thrilled to announce full support for Java 11 in Jenkins starting from Jenkins 2.164 (released on Feb 10, 2019) and LTS 2.164.1 (ETA: March 14th).\nThis means you can now run your Jenkins controllers and agents with a Java 11 JVM.\n\nStarting in June 2018, many events were organized to improve Jenkins code base and add Java 11 support.\nBeyond these events, Core/Plugins maintainers and many other contributors have worked hard to make sure they discover and solve as many issues as possible related to Java 11 support.\n\nThe effort to support Java 11 led to the creation of the JEP-211: Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nIt also spurred the creation of the Platform Special Interest Group to coordinate the Java 11 work and other platform support efforts.\n\nCelebration\n\nWe’d like to take a moment to thank everyone involved in these tasks: code contributors, issue reporters, testers, event planners and attendees and all those in the community who have generously lent their time and support to this effort.\nThank you all!\n\nHere are some of the contributors who helped with this task (alphabetical order):\n\nAlex

Hafner,\nVincent Latombe,\nWadeck Follonier\n\n(We are deeply sorry if we missed anyone in this list.)\n\nGuidelines\n\nIn order to keep it simple, here is how you can start Jenkins on Java 11 using the Docker image.\nYou can select a Java 11 based image by suffixing the tag of the image with -jdk11.\nIf you are upgrading an existing instance please read the Upgrading Jenkins Java version from 8 to 11 page before upgrading.\n\nSo you can run Jenkins on Java 11 with:\n\ndocker run -p 50000:50000 -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:2.164-jdk11\n\nHowever, and as always, you can still start Jenkins with other methods.\nPlease see the more detailed documentation at Running Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nDeveloper guidelines\n\nFor developers involved in Jenkins development, you can find details on developing and testing Jenkins to run on Java 11 on the Java 11 Developer Guidelines.\n\nThis resource regroups the modifications which might need to be done in order to validate the compatibility of plugins for Java 11.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nEven though this is a big achievement, we still have work to do.\n\nOur first priority is adding Java 11 support to JenkinsFile Runner project.\nFrom there, we will move on to port Java 11 support to the Jenkins X project and the Evergreen project.\n\nSo, even if this is a big deal to us, this is not the end of the story.\nIt is a major step that will benefit users, developers, and members of the Jenkins community.\n\nReference links\n\nRunning Jenkins on Java

community and work together\non enhancing the Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nJust to provide some numbers, this is the biggest GSoC ever, 206 organizations will participate in GSoC this year.\nAnd it will be hopefully the biggest year for Jenkins as well.\nWe have 25 project ideas\nand more than 30 potential mentors (and counting!).\nIt is already more than in 2016 and 2018 combined.\nThere are many plugins, SIGs and sub-projects which have already joined GSoC this year.\nAnd we have already received messages and first contributions from dozens of students, yey!\n\nWhat’s next?\nGSoC is officially announced, and please expect more students to contact projects in our\nGitter channels and mailing lists.\nMany communications will also happen in SIG and sub-project channels.\nWe will be working hard in order to help students to find interesting projects, to explore the area,\nand to prepare their project proposals before the deadline on April 9th.\nThen we will process the

How do I apply?\n\nSee the Information for students page for full application guidelines.\n\nWe encourage interested students to reach out to the Jenkins community early and to start exploring project ideas.\nAll project ideas have chats and mailing lists referenced on their pages.\nWe will be also organizing office hours for students,\nand you can use these meetings to meet org admins and mentors and to ask questions.\nAlso, join our Gitter channel and the\nmailing list\nto receive information about such incoming events in the project.\n\nThe application period starts on March 25th, but you can prepare now!\nUse the time before the application period to discuss and improve your project proposals.\nWe also recommend that you become familiar with Jenkins and start exploring your proposal areas.\nProject ideas include quick-start guidelines and reference newbie-friendly issues\nwhich may help with initial study.\nIf you do not see anything interesting,\nyou can propose your own project idea\nor check out ideas proposed by other organizations\nparticipating in GSoC.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt’s not!\nWe are looking for more project ideas and for Jenkins contributors/users\nwho are passionate about Jenkins and want to mentor students.\nNo hardcore experience required, mentors can study the project internals together with students and technical advisors.\nWe are especially interested in ideas beyond the Java stack, and in ideas focusing new technologies and areas\n(e.g. Kubernetes, IoT, Python, Go, whatever).\n\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee the Call for Mentors post\nand Information for mentors for details.\nIf you want to propose a new project,\nplease do so by March 11th so that students have time to explore them and to prepare their proposals.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nImportant dates\n\nMar 11 - deadline for new GSoC project idea proposals\n\nApr 09 - deadline for student applications\n\nMay 06 - accepted projects announced, teams start community bonding and coding\n\nAug 26 - coding period ends\n\nSep 03 - Results announced\n\nSee the GSoC Timeline for more info.\nIn the Jenkins project we will also organize special events during and after GSoC (e.g. at Jenkins world).","title":"Jenkins is accepted to Google Summer Of Code 2019!","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2019","events","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member, open source software and open hardware advocate, TOC chair in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he maintains [Jenkinsfile Runner](<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/\" class=\"bare\">https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/</a>),\ncontributes to several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a> and outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>)\nand organizes <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works on open source programs and [Keptn](<a href=\"https://keptn.sh/\" class=\"bare\">https://keptn.sh/</a>) at the [Dynatrace](<a href=\"https://dynatrace.com\" class=\"bare\">https://dynatrace.com</a>), Open Source Program Office.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9488675b-0d5a-5055-8c7d-1ab61e7ad642","slug":"/blog/2019/02/05/jenkins-new-year-in-china/","strippedHtml":"At the time of the Spring Festival.

With the effort of three skilled engineers,\nmany Jenkins users could learn the edge technologies and useful use cases.\nThey co-organized several Jenkins Meetups in a couple of cities in China.\n\nThere are two workshops about Jenkins and Jenkins X in the DevOps International Summit. James Rawlings gave us a wonderful view of the Jenkins X. Many people start to know this project. The Chinese website of jx would be helpful to those people.\n\nOn November 3rd, 2018 the Jenkins User Conference China(JUCC) was hosted in Shenzhen. More than 200 attendees gathered at JUCC to share and discuss Jenkins, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Pipeline, and Agile.\n\nThere was a Jenkins workshop to teach users to develop a plugin in October. It was during the Hacktoberfest 2018. So some people got a beautiful T-shirt at this meetup. We’ll keep this event in 2019. I hope more users and developers could join us.\n\nThank you all folks. And other friendly contributors.\n\nChinese is our main communication language. A large number of the Jenkins users are not a proficient English speaker.\nSo letting most of Chinese Jenkins users could easily use Jenkins as their CI/CD platform is the final mission of Chinese Localization SIG.\nYou can find three participants on the page. But that’s not the full list.\nMore exciting thing is that Alauda giving a big support which as a startup company.\n\nWeChat is the greatest social media channel in China. WeChat has one billion users.\nAlmost everyone in China has a WeChat account. It must be a perfect place to publish articles and events.\nThere are over 1k people subscribed the Jenkins official WeChat Subscription Account in the last three months.\n\nIn the new year, I’m looking forward to growing up with you all!","title":"Jenkins new year in China","tags":["core","community","chinese"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#989898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/77b35/linuxsuren.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/d4a57/linuxsuren.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/68974/linuxsuren.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/ef6ff/linuxsuren.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/8257c/linuxsuren.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/6766a/linuxsuren.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/22bfc/linuxsuren.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"LinuxSuRen","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Rick is a big fan of Jenkins, also as a contributor leading the Jenkins China community.</p>\n</div>","id":"linuxsuren","irc":null,"linkedin":"linuxsuren","name":"赵晓杰(Rick)","slug":"/blog/authors/linuxsuren","twitter":"LinuxSuRen"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a737d1ad-0575-5b79-8f34-0dd038cbbc0f","slug":"/blog/2019/01/21/fosdem-2019/","strippedHtml":"FOSDEM 2019 (February 2 & 3) is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.\nIt is an annual event that brings open source contributors from around the world for two days of presentations, discussions, and learning.\nWhile the Jenkins project won’t have a table at FOSDEM 2019, we will be well represented before, during, and after the event.\n\nFriday Day - Workshops and Jenkins Office Hours\n\nOn Friday, February 1, we’ll start off with a couple workshops:\n\nJenkins Pipeline Fundamentals\n(9:00 AM – 5:00 PM)\nLearn to create and run Declarative Pipelines!\nYou’ll learn the structure of Declarative Pipeline, how to control the flow of execution, how to save artifacts of the build, and get practice using some of the features that give fit and finish to your Pipeline.\nRegistration required - see the\nevent page\nfor details\n\nJenkins X, Kubernetes, and Friends\nTwo sessions: (9:00 AM – 12:00 PM) and (1:00pm to 4:00pm)\nBy combining the power of Jenkins, its community and the power of Kubernetes, the Jenkins X project provides a path to the future of continuous delivery for microservices and cloud-native applications.\nCome explore some of the features of Jenkins X through this hands-on workshop.\nRegistration required - see the\nevent page\nfor details\n\nAside from the workshops, from 9am to 5pm a bunch of people will be working out of Hilton Brussels Grand Place, hanging out as travelers come in.\nIt’ll be a casual, unstructured day.

We are writing software faster than ever, but the demand for software seems to be going up even more, and I feel more and more businesses and executives are keenly aware that software and developers are king. At the ground level, every team I meet sees the software delivery automation to be a critical part of their \"software factory,\" and it’s important for them to create and manage them with unhinged flexibility and visibility.\n\nJenkins continues to play a major role in making this possible, after 14+ years since its birth, and if anything the pace of growth seems to be accelerating. In this dog year industry, that’s truly remarkable. Being a part of this achievement truly makes me proud.\n\nBuilding Jenkins, being a tool that everyone uses, comes with a great responsibility. So within the Jenkins community, we’ve been hard at work. In fact, 2018 has been the single most innovative year in the history of the whole project across the field, at multiple levels.\n\nAs we got bigger, we needed better ways to drive initiatives that cut across multiple people. This thinking led to JEPs and SIGs, and 2018 saw these formats getting great traction. After a year of operating them, I think we’ve learnt a lot, and I hope we will continue to improve them based on the learning.\n\nThese new formats gave rise to new collaborations. For example, Chinese Localization SIG resulted in our WeChat presence and localized website. Platform SIG was instrumental in Java 11 support.\n\nI’m also very happy to see new batch of leaders. In fear of missing out some people, I’m not going to list them individually, but we celebrated many of them as Jenkins Ambassadors this fall (and please nominate more for the next year!) Those people who lead key efforts are often people who are new to those roles.\n\nSome of the new leaders led other efforts that unlock new contributors. It’s about consciously thinking which segment of our potential contributors we aren’t tapping today and understanding why. Something any business does all the time. Ours resulted in Google Summer of Code and Outreachy participations.\n\nOur security process and the pace of fixes have gone up considerably this year again, reflecting our stepping up to the trust our users gave to us. For example, this year we rolled out a telemetry system that informs us to develop better fixes more quickly.\n\nNow, where these community improvements ultimately matter is what impact we are creating to software that you use. On that front, I think we did great in 2018, resulting in what I call\"5 super powers\" :\n\nJenkins X is probably the most visible innovation of this year, making it much easier to create modern cloud applications on Kubernetes. This also represents the significant expansion of the Jenkins community and its mission.\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code hit a major milestone \"1.0\" this year, and it’s continuing to gain more momentum and traction.\n\n\"Cloud Native Jenkins\" is the term I gave to a new effort that I’m calling to transform Jenkins into general purpose CI/CD engine that runs at scale on Kubernetes. There’s still much to be defined here, but you can already see some great things like Serverless Jenkins.\n\nEvergreen is another young and upcoming project that has ambitious thesis --- drastically simplifying the adoption and operation of Jenkins.\n\nPipeline effort formed a new SIG and I’m looking forward to the impact this will drive in 2019.\n\nThe not-so-secret sauce of the Jenkins community that threads together all these improvements from user visible changes to the community improvements is our ability to evolve. As I look forward to 2019, no doubt these things I mentioned will evolve, morph, merge, and split as we continue to learn and adopt.\n\nSo please, follow @jenkinsci and @jenkinsxio on Twitter to get updates on how we will evolve, and join our community to together build the software that rocks the world.
