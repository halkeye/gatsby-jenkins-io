The CDF believes in the power of Continuous Delivery, and it aims to foster and sustain the ecosystem of open-source, vendor neutral projects.\n\nJenkins contributors have decided that our project should join this new foundation. This discussion happened over a period of time, with a relatively succinct summary of the motivation comes from here.\n\nNow, as a user, what does this mean?\n\nFirst, there will be no big disruption/discontinuity. The same people are still here, no URL is changing, releases will come out like they’ve always been. We will make the decisions the same way as we’ve been making, and pull requests land the same way. Changes will happen continuously over the period of time.\n\nThis is yet another testament to the maturity and the importance of the Jenkins project in this space. With a quarter million Jenkins running around the globe, it’s truly rocking the world of software development from IoT to games, cloud native webapps to machine learning projects. It makes Jenkins such an obvious, safe choice for anyone seeking open heterogeneous DevOps strategy.\n\nThe CDF creates a level playing field that is well-understood to organized contributors, which further, translate into more contributors, hence resulting in a better Jenkins, faster. Over the past years, the Jenkins project has been steadily growing more structures that provide this clarity, and this is the newest step on this trajectory.\n\nAny serious dev teams are combining multiple tools and services to cover the whole software development spectrum. A lot of work gets reinvented in those teams to integrate those tools together. Jenkins will be working more closely with other projects under the umbrella of the CDF, which would result in better aligned software with less overlap.\n\nOur users are practitioners trying to improve the software development process in their organizations. They get that CI/CD/automation which unlocks the productivity that their organizations need, but that’s not always obvious to their organizations as a whole. So our users often struggle to get the necessary support. The CDF will advocate for the practice of Continuous Delivery, and because it’s not coming from a vendor or a project, it will reach the people who can lend that support.\n\nSo I hope you can see why we are so excited about this!\n\nIn fact, for us, this is an idea that we’ve been cooking for close to two years. I don’t think I’m exaggerating much to say the whole idea of the CDF started from the Jenkins project.\n\nA lot of people have done so much work behind the scene to make this happen. But a few people played such instrumental roles that I have to personally thank them namely, Chris Aniszczyk for his patience and persistence, R. Tyler Croy for cooking and evolving the idea, and Tracy Miranda for bringing this idea into a reality.","title":"Jenkins is joining the Continuous Delivery

is a joint blog post prepared by the Java 11 Support Team: Adrien Lecharpentier, Ashton Treadway, Baptiste Mathus, Jenn Briden, Kevin Earls, María Isabel Vilacides, Mark Waite, Ramón León and Oleg Nenashev.\n\nWe have worked hard for this and it’s now here.\nWe are thrilled to announce full support for Java 11 in Jenkins starting from Jenkins 2.164 (released on Feb 10, 2019) and LTS 2.164.1 (ETA: March 14th).\nThis means you can now run your Jenkins controllers and agents with a Java 11 JVM.\n\nStarting in June 2018, many events were organized to improve Jenkins code base and add Java 11 support.\nBeyond these events, Core/Plugins maintainers and many other contributors have worked hard to make sure they discover and solve as many issues as possible related to Java 11 support.\n\nThe effort to support Java 11 led to the creation of the JEP-211: Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nIt also spurred the creation of the Platform Special Interest Group to coordinate the Java 11 work and other platform support efforts.\n\nCelebration\n\nWe’d like to take a moment to thank everyone involved in these tasks: code contributors, issue reporters, testers, event planners and attendees and all those in the community who have generously lent their time and support to this effort.\nThank you all!\n\nHere are some of the contributors who helped with this task (alphabetical order):\n\nAlex Earl,\nAlyssa Tong,\nAshton Treadway,\nBaptiste Mathus,\nCarlos Sanchez,\nDaniel Beck,\nDavid Aldrich,\nDenis Digtyar,\nDevin Nusbaum,\nEmeric Vernat,\nEvaristo Gutierrez,\nGavin Mogan,\nGianpaolo

Hafner,\nVincent Latombe,\nWadeck Follonier\n\n(We are deeply sorry if we missed anyone in this list.)\n\nGuidelines\n\nIn order to keep it simple, here is how you can start Jenkins on Java 11 using the Docker image.\nYou can select a Java 11 based image by suffixing the tag of the image with -jdk11.\nIf you are upgrading an existing instance please read the Upgrading Jenkins Java version from 8 to 11 page before upgrading.\n\nSo you can run Jenkins on Java 11 with:\n\ndocker run -p 50000:50000 -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:2.164-jdk11\n\nHowever, and as always, you can still start Jenkins with other methods.\nPlease see the more detailed documentation at Running Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nDeveloper guidelines\n\nFor developers involved in Jenkins development, you can find details on developing and testing Jenkins to run on Java 11 on the Java 11 Developer Guidelines.\n\nThis resource regroups the modifications which might need to be done in order to validate the compatibility of plugins for Java 11.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nEven though this is a big achievement, we still have work to do.\n\nOur first priority is adding Java 11 support to JenkinsFile Runner project.\nFrom there, we will move on to port Java 11 support to the Jenkins X project and the Evergreen project.\n\nSo, even if this is a big deal to us, this is not the end of the story.\nIt is a major step that will benefit users, developers, and members of the Jenkins community.\n\nReference links\n\nRunning Jenkins on Java

behalf of the Jenkins GSoC org team,\nI am happy to announce that the Jenkins project has been accepted to\nGoogle Summer of Code 2019.\nThis year we invite students and mentors to join the Jenkins community and work together\non enhancing the Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nJust to provide some numbers, this is the biggest GSoC ever, 206 organizations will participate in GSoC this year.\nAnd it will be hopefully the biggest year for Jenkins as well.\nWe have 25 project ideas\nand more than 30 potential mentors (and counting!).\nIt is already more than in 2016 and 2018 combined.\nThere are many plugins, SIGs and sub-projects which have already joined GSoC this year.\nAnd we have already received messages and first contributions from dozens of students, yey!\n\nWhat’s next?\nGSoC is officially announced, and please expect more students to contact projects in our\nGitter channels and mailing lists.\nMany communications will also happen in SIG and sub-project channels.\nWe will be working hard in order to help students to find interesting projects, to explore the area,\nand to prepare their project proposals before the deadline on April 9th.\nThen we will process the applications, select projects and assign mentor teams.\n\nAll information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its sub-project page.\n\nI am a student. How do I apply?\n\nSee the Information for students page for full application guidelines.\n\nWe encourage interested students to reach out to the Jenkins community early and to start exploring project ideas.\nAll project ideas have chats and mailing lists referenced on their pages.\nWe will be also organizing office hours for students,\nand you can use these meetings to meet org admins and mentors and to ask questions.\nAlso, join our Gitter channel and the\nmailing list\nto receive information about such incoming events in the project.\n\nThe application period starts on March 25th, but you can prepare now!\nUse the time before the application period to discuss and improve your project proposals.\nWe also recommend that you become familiar with Jenkins and start exploring your proposal areas.\nProject ideas include quick-start guidelines and reference newbie-friendly issues\nwhich may help with initial study.\nIf you do not see anything interesting,\nyou can propose your own project idea\nor check out ideas proposed by other organizations\nparticipating in GSoC.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt’s not!\nWe are looking for more project ideas and for Jenkins contributors/users\nwho are passionate about Jenkins and want to mentor students.\nNo hardcore experience required, mentors can study the project internals together with students and technical advisors.\nWe are especially interested in ideas beyond the Java stack, and in ideas focusing new technologies and areas\n(e.g. Kubernetes, IoT, Python, Go, whatever).\n\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee the Call for Mentors post\nand Information for mentors for details.\nIf you want to propose a new project,\nplease do so by March 11th so that students have time to explore them and to prepare their proposals.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nImportant dates\n\nMar 11 - deadline for new GSoC project idea proposals\n\nApr 09 - deadline for student applications\n\nMay 06 - accepted projects announced, teams start community bonding and coding\n\nAug 26 - coding period ends\n\nSep 03 - Results announced\n\nSee the GSoC Timeline for more info.\nIn the Jenkins project we will also organize special events during and after GSoC (e.g. at Jenkins world).","title":"Jenkins is accepted to Google Summer Of Code 2019!","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2019","events","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9488675b-0d5a-5055-8c7d-1ab61e7ad642","slug":"/blog/2019/02/05/jenkins-new-year-in-china/","strippedHtml":"At the time of the Spring Festival.

With the effort of three skilled engineers,\nmany Jenkins users could learn the edge technologies and useful use cases.\nThey co-organized several Jenkins Meetups in a couple of cities in China.\n\nThere are two workshops about Jenkins and Jenkins X in the DevOps International Summit. James Rawlings gave us a wonderful view of the Jenkins X. Many people start to know this project. The Chinese website of jx would be helpful to those people.\n\nOn November 3rd, 2018 the Jenkins User Conference China(JUCC) was hosted in Shenzhen. More than 200 attendees gathered at JUCC to share and discuss Jenkins, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Pipeline, and Agile.\n\nThere was a Jenkins workshop to teach users to develop a plugin in October. It was during the Hacktoberfest 2018. So some people got a beautiful T-shirt at this meetup. We’ll keep this event in 2019. I hope more users and developers could join us.\n\nThank you all folks. And other friendly contributors.\n\nChinese is our main communication language. A large number of the Jenkins users are not a proficient English speaker.\nSo letting most of Chinese Jenkins users could easily use Jenkins as their CI/CD platform is the final mission of Chinese Localization SIG.\nYou can find three participants on the page. But that’s not the full list.\nMore exciting thing is that Alauda giving a big support which as a startup company.\n\nWeChat is the greatest social media channel in China. WeChat has one billion users.\nAlmost everyone in China has a WeChat account.

We are writing software faster than ever, but the demand for software seems to be going up even more, and I feel more and more businesses and executives are keenly aware that software and developers are king. At the ground level, every team I meet sees the software delivery automation to be a critical part of their \"software factory,\" and it’s important for them to create and manage them with unhinged flexibility and visibility.\n\nJenkins continues to play a major role in making this possible, after 14+ years since its birth, and if anything the pace of growth seems to be accelerating. In this dog year industry, that’s truly remarkable. Being a part of this achievement truly makes me proud.\n\nBuilding Jenkins, being a tool that everyone uses, comes with a great responsibility. So within the Jenkins community, we’ve been hard at work. In fact, 2018 has been the single most innovative year in the history of the whole project across the field, at multiple levels.\n\nAs we got bigger, we needed better ways to drive initiatives that cut across multiple people. This thinking led to JEPs and SIGs, and 2018 saw these formats getting great traction. After a year of operating them, I think we’ve learnt a lot, and I hope we will continue to improve them based on the learning.\n\nThese new formats gave rise to new collaborations. For example, Chinese Localization SIG resulted in our WeChat presence and localized website. Platform SIG was instrumental in Java 11 support.\n\nI’m also very happy to see new batch of leaders. In fear of missing out some people, I’m not going to list them individually, but we celebrated many of them as Jenkins Ambassadors this fall (and please nominate more for the next year!) Those people who lead key efforts are often people who are new to those roles.\n\nSome of the new leaders led other efforts that unlock new contributors. It’s about consciously thinking which segment of our potential contributors we aren’t tapping today and understanding why. Something any business does all the time. Ours resulted in Google Summer of Code and Outreachy participations.\n\nOur security process and the pace of fixes have gone up considerably this year again, reflecting our stepping up to the trust our users gave to us. For example, this year we rolled out a telemetry system that informs us to develop better fixes more quickly.\n\nNow, where these community improvements ultimately matter is what impact we are creating to software that you use. On that front, I think we did great in 2018, resulting in what I call\"5 super powers\" :\n\nJenkins X is probably the most visible innovation of this year, making it much easier to create modern cloud applications on Kubernetes. This also represents the significant expansion of the Jenkins community and its mission.\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code hit a major milestone \"1.0\" this year, and it’s continuing to gain more momentum and traction.\n\n\"Cloud Native Jenkins\" is the term I gave to a new effort that I’m calling to transform Jenkins into general purpose CI/CD engine that runs at scale on Kubernetes. There’s still much to be defined here, but you can already see some great things like Serverless Jenkins.\n\nEvergreen is another young and upcoming project that has ambitious thesis --- drastically simplifying the adoption and operation of Jenkins.\n\nPipeline effort formed a new SIG and I’m looking forward to the impact this will drive in 2019.\n\nThe not-so-secret sauce of the Jenkins community that threads together all these improvements from user visible changes to the community improvements is our ability to evolve. As I look forward to 2019, no doubt these things I mentioned will evolve, morph, merge, and split as we continue to learn and adopt.\n\nSo please, follow @jenkinsci and @jenkinsxio on Twitter to get updates on how we will evolve, and join our community to together build the software that rocks the world.

refer to Running Jenkins on Java 11 documentation to have the up-to-date details on how to run Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nThis is a joint blogpost prepared by the Java 11 Support Team.\nOn Dec 18 (4PM UTC) we will be also presenting the Java 11 Preview Support at the Jenkins Online Meetup\n( link)\n\nJenkins, one of the leading open-source automation servers, still supports only Java 8.\nOn September 25 OpenJDK 11 was released.\nThis is a Long-Term-Support which will stay around for years,\nand in the Jenkins project we are interested to offer a full support of this version.\nOver the last year many contributors have been working towards enabling support for Java 11 in the project (Jenkins JEP-211).\nIt was a thorny path,\nbut now, on behalf of the Jenkins Platform SIG,\nwe are happy to announce preview availability of Java 11 support in Jenkins weekly releases!\n\nWhy do we need preview availability for Java 11?\nIt offers Jenkins contributors and early adopters a way\nto try out the changes before the general availability release happens early next year.\nIt should help us to get more exploratory testing and, hopefully,\nresolve most of the issues before Java 11 is officially supported in Jenkins.\n\nIn this blog post we will describe how to run with Java 11,\nand how to investigate compatibility issues and report them.\n\nBackground\n\nAs you probably remember,\nin June 2018 we had an online hackathon targeting Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nAs a part of the hackathon,\nwe provided the experimental support of Java 11.\nThis event was a big success for us,\nand we were able to get Jenkins running with Java 10 and 11-ea,\nincluding major features like Jenkins Pipeline, JobDSL, Docker/Kubernetes plugins, Configuration as Code, BlueOcean, etc.\nIt gave us confidence that we can provide Java 11 support in Jenkins without major breaking changes.\nAfter the hackathon, Oleg Nenashev created\njep:211[\"Java 10+ support in Jenkins\"] (was later adjusted to target Java 11 only).\nPlatform Special Interest Group\nhas been also founded to coordinate the Java 11 support work\nand other platform support efforts (packaging, operating system support, etc.).\n\nA group of contributors continued working on Java 11 support,\nmostly focusing on upstreaming functional patches,\nenabling Java 11 support in development tools,\ntesting and addressing known compatibility issues.\nSee the Platform SIG meeting notes for detailed status updates.\nStarting from Jenkins 2.148, Jenkins successfully runs with latest OpenJDK 11 releases on various Linux and Windows platforms.\nWe performed a LOT of automated and exploratory tests, Jenkins plugins appear to work well with some exceptions (see below).\nThere is ongoing test automation effort towards the GA releases,\nbut we were able to successfully run Jenkins core tests,\nfull Acceptance Test Harness,\nand Plugin Compat Tester for recommended plugins.\nWe also deployed a temporary\nExperimental Update Center for Java 11\nwhich allows quickly delivering fixes for Java 11 early adopters.\nJenkins 2.155+ defaults to this update center when running with Java 11,\nand that’s why we announce preview availability for this version.\n\nOn Nov 19, 2018 we presented the current Java 11 support status at the Platform SIG meeting\nslides,\nand we agreed that we would like to proceed with the preview availability so that\nwe can offer something for evaluation to Jenkins users.\nBy the next meeting on Dec 04, all blockers have been addressed,\nand the Platform SIG meeting signed off the Java 11 preview availability.\n\nRunning Jenkins and Java 11 in Docker\n\nStarting from Jenkins 2.155, we provide Docker images for the Jenkins controller and agent.\nAll these images are based on the official\nopenjdk:11-jdk image maintained by the Docker Community.\nThere were discussions about migrating to other base images,\nbut we decided to exclude it from the Preview Availability scope.\nSimilarly, we do not provide Alpine images for now.\n\nJenkins controller image\n\nJava 11 support is now provided as a part of the official\njenkins/jenkins image.\nYou can run the Jenkins with Java 11 simply as:\n\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:jdk11\n\nThe following tags are available:\n\njdk11 - Latest weekly release with Java 11 support\n\n2.155-jdk11 - Weekly releases packaged with Java 11\n\nThe image is fully compatible with\njenkins/jenkins documentation,\ne.g. you can use plugins.txt to install plugins, mount volumes and pass extra options via environment variables.\n\nAgent images\n\nIf you use containerized agents via Docker or Kubernetes plugins,\nwe have also released official Docker images for Jenkins agents:\n\njenkins/agent\n\njenkins/inbound-agent\n\njenkins/ssh-build-agent\n\nAll images use the latest-jdk11 image tag for JDK11 bundles.\nAnd sorry for the obsolete names!\n\nExperimental Jenkins controller images\n\nIn order to simplify testing, we also provide some experimental images on DockerHub.\nWe set up a continuous delivery flow for them,\nso you can get patches without waiting for Jenkins weekly releases.\n\njenkins4eval/blueocean-platform-support -\nEquivalent of jenkinsci/blueocean\n\nTag: latest-jdk11\n\nThe image bundles all Jenkins Pipeline and Blue Ocean patches required to run on Java 11\n\nIf you want to try Pipeline, use this image\n\njenkins/jenkins-experimental -\nEquivalent of jenkins/jenkins\n\nTag: latest-jdk11\n\nThe image is released from the java11-support feature branch in the Jenkins core\n\nThe branch may be slightly ahead or behind the master branch,\nwe may use the branch to quickly deliver patches to Java 11 users\n\nEventually we will move the experimental flow to the new jenkins4eval organization\nbeing created as a part of jep:217[].\n\nRunning jenkins.war with Java 11\n\nRunning without Docker is not that trivial,\nbecause Jenkins depends on some modules which have been removed from Java 11.\nWe plan to address it in the General Availability release somehow (see jira:JENKINS-52186[]),\nbut for now some manual actions are required to run Jenkins WAR with Java 11.\n\nDownload Jenkins WAR for 2.155\n\nDownload the following libraries to the same directory as jenkins.war\n\njaxb-api-2.3.0.jar (save as jaxb-api.jar)\n\njaxb-core-2.3.0.1.jar (save as jaxb-core.jar)\n\njaxb-impl-2.3.0.1.jar (save as jaxb-impl.jar)\n\njavax.activation v.1.2.0 (save as javax.activation.jar)\n\nRun the following command:\n\nRun Jenkins with ${JAVA11_HOME}/bin/java \\\n    -p jaxb-api.jar:javax.activation.jar --add-modules java.xml.bind,java.activation \\\n    -cp jaxb-core.jar:jaxb-impl.jar \\\n    -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java --httpPort=8080 --prefix=/jenkins\n\nKnown compatibility issues\n\nTo help users to track down the compatibility issues,\nwe have created a new Known Java 11 Compatibility Issues Wiki page.\n\nSeveral important issues and obstacles:\n\nPipeline: Support Plugin has a known issue\nwith context persistency when running with Java 11 (jira:JENKINS-51998[])\n\nWe have deployed a temporary fix to the\nExperimental Update Center for Java 11.\n Fix version: 3.0-java11-alpha-1\n\nIf you use Jenkins Pipeline, make sure you run with this fix.\nOtherwise the jobs will fail almost immediately\n\nWhen updating instances to Java 11, make sure there is no running Pipelines\n\njira:JENKINS-54305[] -\nJDK Tool Plugin does not offer installers for JDK 11\n\njira:JENKINS-52282[] -\nJava Web Start is no longer available in Java 11, so it is no longer possible to start agents from Web UI.\nWe do not plan to provide a replacement.\n\nWe also know about some minor incompatibilities in other plugins,\nbut we do not consider them as blockers for preview availability.\n\nReporting compatibility issues\n\nIf you discover any Java 11 incompatibilities, please\nreport issues in our bugtracker.\nPlease set java11-compatibility labels for such issues\nso that they automatically appear on the Wiki page and get triaged.\n\nFor the security issues please use the standard\nvulnerability reporting process.\nAlthough we will be fixing Java 11 specific issues in public while it is in the preview,\nfollowing the security process will help us to investigate impact on Java 8 users.\n\nJava 11 Support Team\n\nOnce Java 11 support is released, we expect reports of regressions in plugins and Jenkins core.\nOne of the concerns are exotic platforms with native libraries, and of course other Java versions.\nThere is also a risk of 3rd-party library incompatibilities with Java 11.\nTo mitigate the risks, we have created a\nJava 11 Support Team.\nThis team will be focusing on triaging the incoming issues,\nhelping to review pull requests and, in some cases, delivering the fixes.\nThe process for this team is documented in JEP-211.\n\nWe do not expect the Java 11 Support Team to be able to fix all discovered issues,\nand we will be working with Jenkins core and plugin maintainers to get the fixes delivered.\nIf you are interested to join the team,\nreach out to us in the Platform SIG Gitter Channel.\n\nContributing\n\nWe will appreciate any kind of contributions in the Java 11 effort,\nincluding trying out Jenkins with Java 11, reporting and fixing compatibility issues.\n\nIf you want to do the exploratory testing,\nwe recommend to try out Java 11 support at one of your test instances.\nSuch testing will be much appreciated,\nespecially if you use some service integration plugins or exotic platforms.\nThe issue reporting guidelines are provided above\n\nIf you are a plugin developer/maintainer,\nwe would appreciate if you could test your plugin with Java 11.\nIn order to help with that, we have created a Wiki page with\nJava 11 Developer guidelines.\nThis page explains how to build and test plugins with Java 11,\nand it also lists known issues in development tools\n\nWhatever you do, please let us know about your experience by sending a message to\nthe Platform SIG mailing list.\nSuch information will help us a lot to track changes and contributions.\nAny other feedback about the migration complexity will be appreciated!\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nOn Dec 18 (4PM UTC) we will be presenting the Java 11 Preview Support at the Jenkins Online Meetup\n( link).\nAt this meetup we will summarize the current Java 11 Preview support status.\nIf you are a plugin developer, we will also organize separate sessions about testing plugins with Java 11 and about common best practices for fixing compatibility issues.\nPlease follow the Platform SIG announcements if you are interested.\n\nIn the next weeks we will focus on addressing feedback from early adopters and\nfixing the discovered compatibility issues.\nWe will also continue working on Java 11 support patches towards the general availability next year (jira:JENKINS-51805[]).\nIn addition to that, we will start working on Java 11 support in subprojects,\nincluding Jenkins X and Jenkins Evergreen.\n\nLinks\n\nJEP-211: Java 11 support in Jenkins\n\nJava requirements in Jenkins\n\nKnown Java 11 Compatibility Issues\n\nJava 11 Developer guidelines\n\nPlatform Special Interest
