How do I apply?\n\nSee the Information for students page for full application guidelines.\n\nWe encourage interested students to reach out to the Jenkins community early and to start exploring project ideas.\nAll project ideas have chats and mailing lists referenced on their pages.\nWe will be also organizing office hours for students,\nand you can use these meetings to meet org admins and mentors and to ask questions.\nAlso, join our Gitter channel and the\nmailing list\nto receive information about such incoming events in the project.\n\nThe application period starts on March 25th, but you can prepare now!\nUse the time before the application period to discuss and improve your project proposals.\nWe also recommend that you become familiar with Jenkins and start exploring your proposal areas.\nProject ideas include quick-start guidelines and reference newbie-friendly issues\nwhich may help with initial study.\nIf you do not see anything interesting,\nyou can propose your own project idea\nor check out ideas proposed by other organizations\nparticipating in GSoC.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt’s not!\nWe are looking for more project ideas and for Jenkins contributors/users\nwho are passionate about Jenkins and want to mentor students.\nNo hardcore experience required, mentors can study the project internals together with students and technical advisors.\nWe are especially interested in ideas beyond the Java stack, and in ideas focusing new technologies and areas\n(e.g. Kubernetes, IoT, Python, Go, whatever).\n\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee the Call for Mentors post\nand Information for mentors for details.\nIf you want to propose a new project,\nplease do so by March 11th so that students have time to explore them and to prepare their proposals.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nImportant dates\n\nMar 11 - deadline for new GSoC project idea proposals\n\nApr 09 - deadline for student applications\n\nMay 06 - accepted projects announced, teams start community bonding and coding\n\nAug 26 - coding period ends\n\nSep 03 - Results announced\n\nSee the GSoC Timeline for more info.\nIn the Jenkins project we will also organize special events during and after GSoC (e.g. at Jenkins world).","title":"Jenkins is accepted to Google Summer Of Code 2019!","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2019","events","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/author/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9488675b-0d5a-5055-8c7d-1ab61e7ad642","slug":"/blog/2019/02/05/jenkins-new-year-in-china/","strippedHtml":"At the time of the Spring Festival. I want to make a summary of some activities in the last year.\nYou might already notice that more and more Chinese contributors emerge in the Jenkins community.\nWe have a GSoC champion who is Shenyu Zheng.\nHe is a great example for other students. With the effort of three skilled engineers,\nmany Jenkins users could learn the edge technologies and useful use cases.\nThey co-organized several Jenkins Meetups in a couple of cities in China.\n\nThere are two workshops about Jenkins and Jenkins X in the DevOps International Summit. James Rawlings gave us a wonderful view of the Jenkins X. Many people start to know this project. The Chinese website of jx would be helpful to those people.\n\nOn November 3rd, 2018 the Jenkins User Conference China(JUCC) was hosted in Shenzhen. More than 200 attendees gathered at JUCC to share and discuss Jenkins, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Pipeline, and Agile.\n\nThere was a Jenkins workshop to teach users to develop a plugin in October. It was during the Hacktoberfest 2018. So some people got a beautiful T-shirt at this meetup. We’ll keep this event in 2019. I hope more users and developers could join us.\n\nThank you all folks. And other friendly contributors.\n\nChinese is our main communication language. A large number of the Jenkins users are not a proficient English speaker.\nSo letting most of Chinese Jenkins users could easily use Jenkins as their CI/CD platform is the final mission of Chinese Localization SIG.\nYou can find three participants on the page. But that’s not the full list.\nMore exciting thing is that Alauda giving a big support which as a startup company.\n\nWeChat is the greatest social media channel in China. WeChat has one billion users.\nAlmost everyone in China has a WeChat account. It must be a perfect place to publish articles and events.\nThere are over 1k people subscribed the Jenkins official WeChat Subscription Account in the last three months.\n\nIn the new year, I’m looking forward to growing up with you all!","title":"Jenkins new year in China","tags":["core","community","chinese"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"LinuxSuRen","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Rick is a big fan of Jenkins, also as a contributor leading the Jenkins China community.</p>\n</div>","id":"linuxsuren","irc":null,"linkedin":"linuxsuren","name":"赵晓杰(Rick)","slug":"/blog/author/linuxsuren","twitter":"LinuxSuRen"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a737d1ad-0575-5b79-8f34-0dd038cbbc0f","slug":"/blog/2019/01/21/fosdem-2019/","strippedHtml":"FOSDEM 2019 (February 2 & 3) is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.\nIt is an annual event that brings open source contributors from around the world for two days of presentations, discussions, and learning.\nWhile the Jenkins project won’t have a table at FOSDEM 2019, we will be well represented before, during, and after the event.\n\nFriday Day - Workshops and Jenkins Office Hours\n\nOn Friday, February 1, we’ll start off with a couple workshops:\n\nJenkins Pipeline Fundamentals\n(9:00 AM – 5:00 PM)\nLearn to create and run Declarative Pipelines!\nYou’ll learn the structure of Declarative Pipeline, how to control the flow of execution, how to save artifacts of the build, and get practice using some of the features that give fit and finish to your Pipeline.\nRegistration required - see the\nevent page\nfor details\n\nJenkins X, Kubernetes, and Friends\nTwo sessions: (9:00 AM – 12:00 PM) and (1:00pm to 4:00pm)\nBy combining the power of Jenkins, its community and the power of Kubernetes, the Jenkins X project provides a path to the future of continuous delivery for microservices and cloud-native applications.\nCome explore some of the features of Jenkins X through this hands-on workshop.\nRegistration required - see the\nevent page\nfor details\n\nAside from the workshops, from 9am to 5pm a bunch of people will be working out of Hilton Brussels Grand Place, hanging out as travelers come in.\nIt’ll be a casual, unstructured day.

We are writing software faster than ever, but the demand for software seems to be going up even more, and I feel more and more businesses and executives are keenly aware that software and developers are king. At the ground level, every team I meet sees the software delivery automation to be a critical part of their \"software factory,\" and it’s important for them to create and manage them with unhinged flexibility and visibility.\n\nJenkins continues to play a major role in making this possible, after 14+ years since its birth, and if anything the pace of growth seems to be accelerating. In this dog year industry, that’s truly remarkable. Being a part of this achievement truly makes me proud.\n\nBuilding Jenkins, being a tool that everyone uses, comes with a great responsibility. So within the Jenkins community, we’ve been hard at work. In fact, 2018 has been the single most innovative year in the history of the whole project across the field, at multiple levels.\n\nAs we got bigger, we needed better ways to drive initiatives that cut across multiple people. This thinking led to JEPs and SIGs, and 2018 saw these formats getting great traction. After a year of operating them, I think we’ve learnt a lot, and I hope we will continue to improve them based on the learning.\n\nThese new formats gave rise to new collaborations. For example, Chinese Localization SIG resulted in our WeChat presence and localized website. Platform SIG was instrumental in Java 11 support.\n\nI’m also very happy to see new batch of leaders. In fear of missing out some people, I’m not going to list them individually, but we celebrated many of them as Jenkins Ambassadors this fall (and please nominate more for the next year!) Those people who lead key efforts are often people who are new to those roles.\n\nSome of the new leaders led other efforts that unlock new contributors. It’s about consciously thinking which segment of our potential contributors we aren’t tapping today and understanding why. Something any business does all the time. Ours resulted in Google Summer of Code and Outreachy participations.\n\nOur security process and the pace of fixes have gone up considerably this year again, reflecting our stepping up to the trust our users gave to us. For example, this year we rolled out a telemetry system that informs us to develop better fixes more quickly.\n\nNow, where these community improvements ultimately matter is what impact we are creating to software that you use. On that front, I think we did great in 2018, resulting in what I call\"5 super powers\" :\n\nJenkins X is probably the most visible innovation of this year, making it much easier to create modern cloud applications on Kubernetes. This also represents the significant expansion of the Jenkins community and its mission.\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code hit a major milestone \"1.0\" this year, and it’s continuing to gain more momentum and traction.\n\n\"Cloud Native Jenkins\" is the term I gave to a new effort that I’m calling to transform Jenkins into general purpose CI/CD engine that runs at scale on Kubernetes. There’s still much to be defined here, but you can already see some great things like Serverless Jenkins.\n\nEvergreen is another young and upcoming project that has ambitious thesis --- drastically simplifying the adoption and operation of Jenkins.\n\nPipeline effort formed a new SIG and I’m looking forward to the impact this will drive in 2019.\n\nThe not-so-secret sauce of the Jenkins community that threads together all these improvements from user visible changes to the community improvements is our ability to evolve. As I look forward to 2019, no doubt these things I mentioned will evolve, morph, merge, and split as we continue to learn and adopt.\n\nSo please, follow @jenkinsci and @jenkinsxio on Twitter to get updates on how we will evolve, and join our community to together build the software that rocks the world.

refer to Running Jenkins on Java 11 documentation to have the up-to-date details on how to run Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nThis is a joint blogpost prepared by the Java 11 Support Team.\nOn Dec 18 (4PM UTC) we will be also presenting the Java 11 Preview Support at the Jenkins Online Meetup\n( link)\n\nJenkins, one of the leading open-source automation servers, still supports only Java 8.\nOn September 25 OpenJDK 11 was released.\nThis is a Long-Term-Support which will stay around for years,\nand in the Jenkins project we are interested to offer a full support of this version.\nOver the last year many contributors have been working towards enabling support for Java 11 in the project (Jenkins JEP-211).\nIt was a thorny path,\nbut now, on behalf of the Jenkins Platform SIG,\nwe are happy to announce preview availability of Java 11 support in Jenkins weekly releases!\n\nWhy do we need preview availability for Java 11?\nIt offers Jenkins contributors and early adopters a way\nto try out the changes before the general availability release happens early next year.\nIt should help us to get more exploratory testing and, hopefully,\nresolve most of the issues before Java 11 is officially supported in Jenkins.\n\nIn this blog post we will describe how to run with Java 11,\nand how to investigate compatibility issues and report them.\n\nBackground\n\nAs you probably remember,\nin June 2018 we had an online hackathon targeting Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nAs a part of the hackathon,\nwe provided the experimental support of Java 11.\nThis event was a big success for us,\nand we were able to get Jenkins running with Java 10 and 11-ea,\nincluding major features like Jenkins Pipeline, JobDSL, Docker/Kubernetes plugins, Configuration as Code, BlueOcean, etc.\nIt gave us confidence that we can provide Java 11 support in Jenkins without major breaking changes.\nAfter the hackathon, Oleg Nenashev created\njep:211[\"Java 10+ support in Jenkins\"] (was later adjusted to target Java 11 only).\nPlatform Special Interest Group\nhas been also founded to coordinate the Java 11 support work\nand other platform support efforts (packaging, operating system support, etc.).\n\nA group of contributors continued working on Java 11 support,\nmostly focusing on upstreaming functional patches,\nenabling Java 11 support in development tools,\ntesting and addressing known compatibility issues.\nSee the Platform SIG meeting notes for detailed status updates.\nStarting from Jenkins 2.148, Jenkins successfully runs with latest OpenJDK 11 releases on various Linux and Windows platforms.\nWe performed a LOT of automated and exploratory tests, Jenkins plugins appear to work well with some exceptions (see below).\nThere is ongoing test automation effort towards the GA releases,\nbut we were able to successfully run Jenkins core tests,\nfull Acceptance Test Harness,\nand Plugin Compat Tester for recommended plugins.\nWe also deployed a temporary\nExperimental Update Center for Java 11\nwhich allows quickly delivering fixes for Java 11 early adopters.\nJenkins 2.155+ defaults to this update center when running with Java 11,\nand that’s why we announce preview availability for this version.\n\nOn Nov 19, 2018 we presented the current Java 11 support status at the Platform SIG meeting\nslides,\nand we agreed that we would like to proceed with the preview availability so that\nwe can offer something for evaluation to Jenkins users.\nBy the next meeting on Dec 04, all blockers have been addressed,\nand the Platform SIG meeting signed off the Java 11 preview availability.\n\nRunning Jenkins and Java 11 in Docker\n\nStarting from Jenkins 2.155, we provide Docker images for the Jenkins controller and agent.\nAll these images are based on the official\nopenjdk:11-jdk image maintained by the Docker Community.\nThere were discussions about migrating to other base images,\nbut we decided to exclude it from the Preview Availability scope.\nSimilarly, we do not provide Alpine images for now.\n\nJenkins controller image\n\nJava 11 support is now provided as a part of the official\njenkins/jenkins image.\nYou can run the Jenkins with Java 11 simply as:\n\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:jdk11\n\nThe following tags are available:\n\njdk11 - Latest weekly release with Java 11 support\n\n2.155-jdk11 - Weekly releases packaged with Java 11\n\nThe image is fully compatible with\njenkins/jenkins documentation,\ne.g. you can use plugins.txt to install plugins, mount volumes and pass extra options via environment variables.\n\nAgent images\n\nIf you use containerized agents via Docker or Kubernetes plugins,\nwe have also released official Docker images for Jenkins agents:\n\njenkins/agent\n\njenkins/inbound-agent\n\njenkins/ssh-build-agent\n\nAll images use the latest-jdk11 image tag for JDK11 bundles.\nAnd sorry for the obsolete names!\n\nExperimental Jenkins controller images\n\nIn order to simplify testing, we also provide some experimental images on DockerHub.\nWe set up a continuous delivery flow for them,\nso you can get patches without waiting for Jenkins weekly releases.\n\njenkins4eval/blueocean-platform-support -\nEquivalent of jenkinsci/blueocean\n\nTag: latest-jdk11\n\nThe image bundles all Jenkins Pipeline and Blue Ocean patches required to run on Java 11\n\nIf you want to try Pipeline, use this image\n\njenkins/jenkins-experimental -\nEquivalent of jenkins/jenkins\n\nTag: latest-jdk11\n\nThe image is released from the java11-support feature branch in the Jenkins core\n\nThe branch may be slightly ahead or behind the master branch,\nwe may use the branch to quickly deliver patches to Java 11 users\n\nEventually we will move the experimental flow to the new jenkins4eval organization\nbeing created as a part of jep:217[].\n\nRunning jenkins.war with Java 11\n\nRunning without Docker is not that trivial,\nbecause Jenkins depends on some modules which have been removed from Java 11.\nWe plan to address it in the General Availability release somehow (see jira:JENKINS-52186[]),\nbut for now some manual actions are required to run Jenkins WAR with Java 11.\n\nDownload Jenkins WAR for 2.155\n\nDownload the following libraries to the same directory as jenkins.war\n\njaxb-api-2.3.0.jar (save as jaxb-api.jar)\n\njaxb-core-2.3.0.1.jar (save as jaxb-core.jar)\n\njaxb-impl-2.3.0.1.jar (save as jaxb-impl.jar)\n\njavax.activation v.1.2.0 (save as javax.activation.jar)\n\nRun the following command:\n\nRun Jenkins with ${JAVA11_HOME}/bin/java \\\n    -p jaxb-api.jar:javax.activation.jar --add-modules java.xml.bind,java.activation \\\n    -cp jaxb-core.jar:jaxb-impl.jar \\\n    -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java --httpPort=8080 --prefix=/jenkins\n\nKnown compatibility issues\n\nTo help users to track down the compatibility issues,\nwe have created a new Known Java 11 Compatibility Issues Wiki page.\n\nSeveral important issues and obstacles:\n\nPipeline: Support Plugin has a known issue\nwith context persistency when running with Java 11 (jira:JENKINS-51998[])\n\nWe have deployed a temporary fix to the\nExperimental Update Center for Java 11.\n Fix version: 3.0-java11-alpha-1\n\nIf you use Jenkins Pipeline, make sure you run with this fix.\nOtherwise the jobs will fail almost immediately\n\nWhen updating instances to Java 11, make sure there is no running Pipelines\n\njira:JENKINS-54305[] -\nJDK Tool Plugin does not offer installers for JDK 11\n\njira:JENKINS-52282[] -\nJava Web Start is no longer available in Java 11, so it is no longer possible to start agents from Web UI.\nWe do not plan to provide a replacement.\n\nWe also know about some minor incompatibilities in other plugins,\nbut we do not consider them as blockers for preview availability.\n\nReporting compatibility issues\n\nIf you discover any Java 11 incompatibilities, please\nreport issues in our bugtracker.\nPlease set java11-compatibility labels for such issues\nso that they automatically appear on the Wiki page and get triaged.\n\nFor the security issues please use the standard\nvulnerability reporting process.\nAlthough we will be fixing Java 11 specific issues in public while it is in the preview,\nfollowing the security process will help us to investigate impact on Java 8 users.\n\nJava 11 Support Team\n\nOnce Java 11 support is released, we expect reports of regressions in plugins and Jenkins core.\nOne of the concerns are exotic platforms with native libraries, and of course other Java versions.\nThere is also a risk of 3rd-party library incompatibilities with Java 11.\nTo mitigate the risks, we have created a\nJava 11 Support Team.\nThis team will be focusing on triaging the incoming issues,\nhelping to review pull requests and, in some cases, delivering the fixes.\nThe process for this team is documented in JEP-211.\n\nWe do not expect the Java 11 Support Team to be able to fix all discovered issues,\nand we will be working with Jenkins core and plugin maintainers to get the fixes delivered.\nIf you are interested to join the team,\nreach out to us in the Platform SIG Gitter Channel.\n\nContributing\n\nWe will appreciate any kind of contributions in the Java 11 effort,\nincluding trying out Jenkins with Java 11, reporting and fixing compatibility issues.\n\nIf you want to do the exploratory testing,\nwe recommend to try out Java 11 support at one of your test instances.\nSuch testing will be much appreciated,\nespecially if you use some service integration plugins or exotic platforms.\nThe issue reporting guidelines are provided above\n\nIf you are a plugin developer/maintainer,\nwe would appreciate if you could test your plugin with Java 11.\nIn order to help with that, we have created a Wiki page with\nJava 11 Developer guidelines.\nThis page explains how to build and test plugins with Java 11,\nand it also lists known issues in development tools\n\nWhatever you do, please let us know about your experience by sending a message to\nthe Platform SIG mailing list.\nSuch information will help us a lot to track changes and contributions.\nAny other feedback about the migration complexity will be appreciated!\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nOn Dec 18 (4PM UTC) we will be presenting the Java 11 Preview Support at the Jenkins Online Meetup\n( link).\nAt this meetup we will summarize the current Java 11 Preview support status.\nIf you are a plugin developer, we will also organize separate sessions about testing plugins with Java 11 and about common best practices for fixing compatibility issues.\nPlease follow the Platform SIG announcements if you are interested.\n\nIn the next weeks we will focus on addressing feedback from early adopters and\nfixing the discovered compatibility issues.\nWe will also continue working on Java 11 support patches towards the general availability next year (jira:JENKINS-51805[]).\nIn addition to that, we will start working on Java 11 support in subprojects,\nincluding Jenkins X and Jenkins Evergreen.\n\nLinks\n\nJEP-211: Java 11 support in Jenkins\n\nJava requirements in Jenkins\n\nKnown Java 11 Compatibility Issues\n\nJava 11 Developer guidelines\n\nPlatform Special Interest

year marks the first time the Jenkins project is participating in Outreachy.\nOutreachy is a program similar to Google Summer of Code (GSoC) where interns work on open source projects for a paid stipend.\nThe key difference is that Outreachy reaches out to underrepresented groups and those who face systemic bias or discrimination in the technology industry in their home country.\nOnce I learned about this program, I immediately volunteered to mentor as the concept strongly aligns with my ideals of inclusiveness and community building.\nI’m happy to report that both the Jenkins project,  and my employer [CloudBees]( https://www.cloudbees.com), have been very supportive of this program.\n\nExpanding on our previous efforts to mentor students in GSoC, this year we’ve joined up with Outreachy to mentor two interns.\nOur interns for this season of Outreachy, Latha Gunasekar and David Olorundare, will be working with me on audit logging support for Jenkins.\nI am excited to welcome both David and Latha, and am looking forward to what they will learn about both professional software engineering and contributing to an open source community.\nStay tuned for blog post entries introducing both people in the near future.\n\nThe audit logging support project forms a new connection between Jenkins and Apache Log4j which offers great opportunities for our interns to learn more about open source governance and meet new people.\nAs a bonus, the project aims to provide the tooling necessary to support advanced observability concerns such as running anomaly detection on authentication events to detect potential intrusion attempts.\nWe will also be authoring a JEP to detail the audit logging API provided by the plugin and how other plugins can define and log their own audit events besides the Jenkins Core ones that come with the plugin.\n\nI’m looking forward to the great work we’ll be doing together, and I hope that we’ll be able to welcome more Outreachy interns in the future!","title":"Outreachy internships to add audit logging support to

year, the Jenkins organization participated in the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit\nat the Google office in Sunnyvale on Oct 12, 13 and 14, 2018.\nThe GSoC Mentor Summit is where mentors of all organizations participating in the GSoC program are invited each year\nto learn and network with mentors from other organization, and make GSoC a better program.\nThis is the second time Jenkins mentors have participated in the summit, the first time was in 2016.\n\nExceptionally, three Jenkins GSoC mentors were invited to the summit this year.\nNormally only two mentors are invited, but when there are cancellations, Google draws a name at random from the waiting list,\nand the Jenkins organization was lucky enough and sent an extra mentor this year!\nThe mentors participating this year were Oleg Nenashev, Jeff Pearce and Martin d’Anjou.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the Mentor Summit is not a typical conference where you go\nsit and listen at what speakers have to say, quite the contrary. The Mentor Summit is an unconference\nwhere participants are invited to fill empty time slots with their own topic of discussion.\n\nFriday Oct 12\n\nPre-conference meeting\n\nThe mentors had a short pre-conference meeting to reflect on the Jenkins participation in the 2018 GSoC program,\nand to plan for 2019.\nWe were joined at this meeting by Lloyd Chang, whom we had met at Jenkins World 2018.\nThank you Lloyd for joining us! A few ideas we had for 2019 are:\n\nMove project proposals to individual Google Documents\n\nCreate a template for project proposed by potential mentors and by project champions\n\nCreate an Organization Administrator Guide for future Jenkins GSoC project admins\n\nOther preparations we agreed to work on include a review of the 2018 feedback and the creation\nof an Epic capturing the action items in preparation for 2019.\nWe are also planning on making progress on the GSoC Budget process described in JEP-8.\n\nSummit Starts!\n\nThe summit started by a welcoming dinner at the Google Cafeteria and an evening session\nwhere we were explained how the unconference would work. We proposed a few topics:\ndealing with CPT lost slots, motivating mentors, and Open Source Hardware ASIC/FPGA.\n\nOn thing to say is that everyone at the conference had heard of Jenkins, or was already using Jenkins.\nLots of people came to tell us their Jenkins experience.\n\nI noticed this too - made me feel proud to be part of the Jenkins project.\n\n— Jeff Pearce\nJenkins GSoC mentor in 2018\n\nSaturday Oct 13\n\nThe morning started with a couple of announcements from Google.\nThe first one was that Google is thinking of creating a program called \"Google Season of Docs\" (GSoD for short),\nwhere technical writers would be paired with Open Source Organizations to help them write documentation such as:\n\nHigh-impact tutorials\n\nSet of How-To Guides\n\nContributor’s Guide\n\nDocumentation refactoring\n\nPlain documentation\n\nWe have additional details regarding this in the\nGSoC Mentor Summit Notes\nand we quickly concluded that if this program comes to life, Jenkins should be a participating organization.\n\nThe other announcement made by the GSoC administrators is that GSoC may take a different form in 2020.\nHowever, not much more information has been made available at this time.\nThe program has been operating for 13 years, and in 2020 it will have been 15 years.\n\nThe announcements were followed by a series of morning lightning talks.\nThis is where organizations showcase what their students accomplished during the program.\nThis is when we had a bit of a surprise…​\n\nOleg who had signed up for the evening lightning talks, was watching the talks while casually preparing slides for his evening presentation.\nBut something unusual happened: many talks were shorter than the 3-minute allotted, and suddenly we were ahead of schedule.\nThat’s when Oleg was called to the stage.\nI had no idea whether his slides were ready or not since he had just leaned over to me to say that he wanted to talk about all 3 projects we had this year.\nNot knowing how far he had gotten into refactoring the slides, this was going to be…​ interesting.\nBeing an experienced presenter, Oleg pulled it off brilliantly.\nThe slides were effectively ready (how he managed that I have no idea),\nbut you can see the slides of his lightning talk here:\nJenkins Remoting over Apache Kafka.\n\nThen there were the unconference sessions. Some of the sessions we attended are:\n\nDocumentation\n\nAttracting and retaining mentors (facilitated by Martin)\n\nOrganizing and motivating volunteers and mentors\n\nGetting students from coding/boot camps involved in open source\n\nRetaining students after GSoC\n\nOpen Event management System\n\nGSoC Feedback\n\nWe have notes for all the session in the main document.\nSome sessions were captured in separated documents which are linked from the main document, or from this blog post.\n\nThere were lots of good ideas in those sessions, and we will do what we can next year to implement some of them.\n\nSome organizations have said that the key for student retention\nis to give them responsibilities and tasks after the program is over.\nWe have certainly seen that this year, with one of our students asking for more responsibilities and wanting to know how\nhis plugin project could continue to grow within the Jenkins project (while at the same time help out on another GSoC plugin!).\n\nIn the evening was the second round of lightning talks.\nJeff Pearce presented the Code Coverage API Plugin lightning talk,\n(he was not caught by surprise).\n\nAfter the lightning talks, we were invited to hang out at the cafeteria and on the patio, to exchange stickers,\nnetwork with mentors of other organizations, and enjoy late evening snacks, music and of course the chocolate table!\n\nSunday Oct 14\n\nOn Sunday, the sessions continued. An interesting session was \"Beyond GSoC, What can Google do?\".\nOne person got a big round of applause when he said: \"Cloud credits\". It turns out the GSoC program admins\nhave been trying to get that for us for about 3 years. Google may be big and powerful, but some things\nare hard and remain hard in the corporate world.\n\nAn interesting suggestion was made by Oleg, and it would be to have a program with smaller, shorter term\ncommitments, something that would encourage more granular contributions but would not require a 4-month\nlong commitment. This was noted by the GSoC program admins.\n\nThen we attended a number of sessions:\n\nOpen Hardware ASIC/FPGA (facilitated by Martin)\n\nCommunity Metrics\n\nOutreachy (Jenkins is participating in this program)\n\nFailing a student\n\nBurnout (of mentors and org admins)\n\nThen the day came to an end with some last words by Google thanking all the mentors and volunteers who\nrun this program in their organizations.\n\nReturn trip\n\nI would now like to add a personal note. After the summit, like many others I fly back home,\nso I spend the evening at the SFO international terminal waiting for my late night flight.\nThat is where I get to meet more mentors, as some of us still wear our badges and T-Shirts,\nand also recognize each other from being at the conference.\nAnd funny enough, there are so many geeks at that terminal\nthat we may have recruited, among the passengers, a mentor to another org for next year!\n\nWant a GSoC student to work on your project in 2019?\n\nWe have already started the preparations for GSoC 2019.\nAnd we cannot do this without the participation of the Jenkins community.\nWe are already looking for:\n\nMentors from the Jenkins Special Interest Groups\n\nMentors from any background and any provenance (being a Jenkins developer is NOT required)\n\nProject proposals\n\nStudents and their proposals\n\nLots of people are afraid that mentoring a student will take a lot of their time.\nIf you feel that way, you are not alone. It does take some time. In my case, I spend 5 to 8 hours per week on mentor tasks (more at the start, less at the end).\nTo make it easier on mentors who likely have full time jobs and life commitments, we define different mentor roles:\n\nProject champion co-mentor : this is the mentor who proposes the idea, but may not have all the Jenkins code expertise needed. This mentor works with the student to define the project and acts mostly as a \"customer\" of the project. This mentor usually know enough about coding to comment on pull-requests with regards to the over quality, style and features of the code.\n\nTechnical co-mentor : this is the mentor who knows enough about the Jenkins code to guide the student on coding, and to provide Jenkins specific code reviews on pull-requests, but has limited involvement outside the coding activity of the student.\n\nThere is a third role which is:\n\nSubject Matter Expert : these individuals are not mentors, but we reach out to them 3-4 times during the project for advice and guidance, and sometimes complicated programming challenges.\n\nIf you have questions or are curious about the program,\ncontact us on the GSoC Gitter SIG chat.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that project proposals are not limited to \"big projects\".\nFor example, it is perfectly fine to have a proposal that is a collection of related Jira issues that aim to improve your project,\nor a list of tasks that need to be done for your project.\nWriting documentation is outside the scope of GSoC, but automating\ndocumentation generation, as long as it is mostly about writing code, is within the scope of GSoC.\n\nWe look forward working with the Jenkins community on GSoC 2019!","title":"Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit 2018","tags":["community","events","gsoc","gsoc2018"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"martinda","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Martin is a Jenkins community member.
