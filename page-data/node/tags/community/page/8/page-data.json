The sound isn’t great but it was a truly visionary talk:\n\nFinally the event finished with swag presentations and a fun Kahoot quiz to wrap things up.\n\nContributor Appreciation Event\n\nAfter the summit, contributors were invited to join at the after party at Spin.\nSpin was a unique venue in San Francisco where attendees could socialise and also play ping-pong!\nWhile some took it seriously most enjoyed the relaxed way to get to know their fellow contributors.\n\nSee you in Nice\n\nThe event was a lot of fun and the contributor summit in Nice will follow a very similar structure.\nAll levels of contributor are welcome, there will be lots of opportunity for in-depth discussions and you can even do an ignite talk!\nWhile we won’t be repeating the ping pong event there will be something equally unique to follow on from the summit.\n\nAttending is free, and no DevOps World | Jenkins World ticket is needed, but RSVP if you are going to attend to help us plan.\nSee you there!\n\nAs long as you’re in Nice for the Contributor Summit,\njoin Tracy, Kohsuke, and hundreds of other Jenkins users at\nDevOps World - Jenkins World on October 22-25.\nRegister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"What to Expect at the Jenkins Contributor Summit","tags":["community","events","jenkins-world"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/f84eb/tracymiranda.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/6105b/tracymiranda.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/9d80c/tracymiranda.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/f84eb/tracymiranda.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/a5e1e/tracymiranda.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/a4758/tracymiranda.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/fec68/tracymiranda.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/fe590/tracymiranda.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/c2c8e/tracymiranda.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":116}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/36f2862463dddd3649a3901f5cb4f6ed/tracymiranda.jpg"},"blog":"https://tracymiranda.com/","github":"tracymiranda","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Tracy is the Director of Open Source Community at CloudBees, long time open source contributor and evangelist.</p>\n</div>","id":"tracymiranda","irc":"tracymiranda","linkedin":null,"name":"Tracy Miranda","slug":"/blog/authors/tracymiranda","twitter":"tracymiranda"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":"c5377da5-1ab5-51ab-994c-510bae06a710","slug":"/blog/2018/10/14/gsoc2018-results/","strippedHtml":"It has been a while since the last blogpost about Google Summer of Code in Jenkins.\nGSoC 2018 has officially finished on August 23, and we had a Jenkins Online Meetup where we had final presentations of the GSoC projects.\nIt is never late to provide more context, so I would like to summarize the results and provide updates of what was happening in Jenkins GSoC Special Interest Group over last 2 months.\nIn this blogpost you can find project status overviews and updates from the Jenkins GSoC SIG.\n\nBut first of all, I would like to thank all our students, their mentors\nand to all other contributors who proposed project ideas, participated in student selection, community bonding and further reviews.\nGoogle Summer of Code is a major effort which would not be possible without active participation of the Jenkins community\n\nSummary\n\nThis year we started preparing for Google Summer of Code in early December.\n14 project ideas and 12 potential mentors we published on our website,\nand we got dozens of students reaching out to us during the application period.\nAfter processing applications, we have selected 4 applications for GSoC.\nUnfortunately one project got cancelled due to student eligibility issues.\n\nSo, we had the following projects:\nCode Coverage API plugin, Remoting over Apache Kafka, and Simple Pull-Request Job Plugin\n(also known as Pipeline as YAML).\nAll these projects have a significant value to the Jenkins community.\nThey were focused on areas which have been discussed in the community for a long time,\nbut which had no progress so far.\nGoogle Summer of Code allowed us to kick-start these projects,\nand to make significant progress there.\nAll projects have been released and made available in the Jenkins community (common or experimental update centers).\n\nIn total there were 9 blogposts about GSoC projects on jenkins.io,\nand also 2 Jenkins Online Meetups.\nGSoC results have been also presented at DevOps World - Jenkins World conference and the contributor summit.\n\nCode Coverage API Plugin\n\nStudent: Shenyu Zheng, Henan University, China\n\nMentors:\nJeff Pearce,\nSteven Christou,\nOleg Nenashev,\nSupun Wanniarachchi\n\nProject page\n\nThere are many code coverage plugins in Jenkins: Cobertura, JaCoCo, Emma, etc., etc.\nThe problem with these plugins is that each of them implements all code coverage features on their own.\nSo you get different feature sets, UIs, CLI commands and REST APIs.\nThe idea of this project was to unify the existing functionality and offer a new API plugin which other plugins could extend.\nIt would help to simplify existing plugin and to create new plugins for coverage tools.\n\nThe project has started really well, and we had the first demo after a week of coding.\nThen Shenyu continued extending the plugin’s functionality over coding periods.\nHere is the list of the key features offered by the plugin:\n\nFlexible data structure for defining and storing coverage metrics within Jenkins\n\nCoverage charts and trends\n\nSource code navigation\n\nREST API for retrieving coverage stats and trends\n\nReport aggregation for parallel steps\n\nExtension points which allow integrating other plugins\n\nIn addition to the Code Coverage API Plugin,\nShenyu added integration to the Cobertura Plugin and also created a new llvm-cov plugin which is expected to be released soon.\n\nAfter GSoC Shenyu continued contributing to the Jenkins project.\nHe works on the Code Coverage API plugin and also participates in the Chinese Localization SIG.\n\nSimple Pull-Request Job Plugin\n\nStudent: Abhishek Gautam, Visvesvaraya National Institute of technology, India\n\nMentors:\nMartin d’Anjou,\nJeff Knurek,\nKristin Whetstone\n\nProject page\n\nThis project focused on introducing a way to\neasily define pull-request build job definitions in YAML.\nThis project has been shaped a lot during the application period and community bonding,\nso that the project fit the existing Jenkins Ecosystem better.\nFinally it was decided to build the new plugin on the top of Pipeline: Multi-Branch Plugin.\nThere was also an idea to offer extra syntax sugar, templating and automatic resolution for common flows,\nso that users need less time to define Pipelines for common use-cases.\n\nThe plugin allows defining Pipeline jobs as YAML being stored in SCM.\nOriginal design presumed a new job type,\nbut during community bonding and Phase 1 prototyping it was decided to build the plugin on the top of the existing Pipeline ecosystem and extension points.\nCurrently the plugin generates Declarative Pipeline code from YAML so that it gets a lot of Pipeline features out-of-the box.\nIn addition to that, Simple Pull Request Job Plugin uses a an engine provided by the Configuration as Code plugin to convert YAML snippets\nto Pipeline step definitions.\n\nThe plugin has been well described by Abhishek in his Pipeline as YAML blogpost in August.\nCurrently it is available in the Experimental Update Center as an alpha version.\nPham Vu Tuan, one of our GSoC students, have also joined the plugin team.\nAt the DevOps World - Jenkins World hackfest we had discussions with the Jenkins Pipeline team,\nand we have a plan towards making this plugin available as an Incubated Pipeline project.\nThe final implementation may change,\nbut in any case the project gave us a working prototype and a lot of information about  obstacles we need to resolve.\n\nRemoting over Apache Kafka\n\nStudent: Pham Vu Tuan, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore\n\nMentors:\nOleg Nenashev,\nSupun Wanniarachchi\n\nProject page\n\nLast but not least, Remoting over Kafka is another challenging project we had.\nTo implement communication between its controllers and agents, Jenkins widely uses home-grown protocol implementations based on TCP\n( JNLP 1..4 protocols).\nThere are some performance and stability implementations,\nand there have been discussions about using an industry-standard message bus or queue.\nPham Vu Tuan proposed to use Apache Kafka for it,\nand after some experiments during community bonding and first coding phase we agreed to go forward with this implementation.\n\nDuring his project Vu Tuan extended Jenkins Core and Remoting to allow implementing an agent communication channel in a plugin.\nThen he has created a new Remoting over Kafka plugin\nwhich is now available in the main Jenkins Update cente.\nOnce the plugin is installed, it is possible to connect to agents over Apache Kafka and execute all types of Jenkins jobs there.\nThere are also official jenkins/remoting-kafka-agent images available on DockerHub.\n\nVu Tuan continued contributing to the Jenkins project after GSoC, currently he maintains the Remoting over Kafka plugin.\nHe visited the DevOps World - Jenkins World US conference in September, presented his GSoC project at the\nJenkins Contributor Summit.\nYou can find his slides here.\nAfter the conference he also participated in the hackfest where he helped to migrate Jenkins' DNS services to Microsoft Azure.\n\nWhat could we do better?\n\nAfter the end of GSoC we had a Retrospective with GSoC students and mentors.\nWe discussed the issues we encountered during the projects,\nand ways to improve the student and mentor experience.\n\nMain takeaways for us:\n\nGSoC projects should be aligned with Jenkins Special Interest Groups (SIGs) or subprojects in order to get a wider list of stakeholders\nProjects should be aligned with SIG priorities when possible\n\nIn addition to GSoC SIG meetings and Jenkins Online Meetups during student evaluation,\nwe should also run regular status updates within SIGs so that there more contributors involved in projects\n\nWe should invest more time into forming mentor teams before the application period starts.\nThis year there were changes in mentor teams after the community bonding started, and it complicated the work\n\nWe should pay more attention to student eligibility.\nThis year we started from 4 projects, but unfortunately one project (EDA plugins for Jenkins) got cancelled due to the visa limitations the student had.\n\nWe should do regular office hours for mentors/students so that it is possible to exchange information between GSoC projects within the organization.\nThis year we cancelled them at the end of phase and relied only on regular project meetings and mailing lists, but this is not enough.\n\nFor me personally the main takeaway is also to reduce direct involvement into the project as a mentor and technical advisor.\nDoing org administration, logistics and mentorship is not good from a bus factor PoV,\nand I believe I was pushing my vision too hard in few cases.\nWill do my best to prevent it next year.\n\nIf you want to share your feedback and ideas,\nplease reach out to us using the GSoC mailing list.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn order to improve GSoC organization in Jenkins,\nwe have have created a GSoC Special Interest Group which will be running non-stop as other SIGs in Jenkins.\nThe objective of the SIG is to organize GSoC, work with potential students/mentors,\nand to help students stay involved in the community after GSoC ends.\nIn this SIG we will have monthly meetings to sync-up on GSoC.\nIf you are interested to contribute, please join the SIG.\n\nAccording to the Retrospective, next year we plan to invest more\ninto communication with mentors.\nWe will also try to tie new project proposals to Jenkins\nSpecial Interest Groups so that the students become a part\nof ongoing coordinated efforts.\nThis weekend Martin d’Anjou, Jeff Pearce and me are participating in the GSoC Mentor summit to share experiences and to study from other GSoC organizations.\nOn October 17 we will have a GSoC SIG meeting to discuss our experience and to discuss next steps.\n\nIn addition to that,\nJenkins Google Summer of Code will be presented at DevOps World - Jenkins World Nice and at the contributor summit.\nIf you plan to visit the conference and you are interested to participate in Google Summer of Code and other community activities,\nplease join us at the contributor summit or stop by at the community booth.\n\nAnd, elephant in the room…​ GSoC 2019.\nOf course we are going to apply, stay tuned for new announcements.\nWe have already started collecting project ideas for the next year.\nIf you are interested to participate as a student or mentor,\nplease reach out to us using the GSoC SIG mailing list.","title":"Jenkins in Google Summer of Code 2018 Results","tags":["community","events","gsoc","gsoc2018"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/914ee/oleg_nenashev.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/1c9ce/oleg_nenashev.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/bf8e1/oleg_nenashev.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/acb7c/oleg_nenashev.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/ef6ff/oleg_nenashev.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/8257c/oleg_nenashev.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/6766a/oleg_nenashev.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/22bfc/oleg_nenashev.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/611f92ce782a36a3a1454a29c79753db/oleg_nenashev.png"},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ea880537-4dfa-5cf5-9dbd-1aa35b08242b","slug":"/blog/2018/10/12/hackathons-in-october/","strippedHtml":"Traditionally there are a lot of events happening in the Jenkins organization in Autumn.\nI would like to share some information about the upcoming hackathons.\n\nOnline Event: Hacktoberfest\n\nAs you probably know, there is an ongoing Hacktoberfest event.\nThe Jenkins project is participating in it and everybody is welcome to contribute to Jenkins as a part of this event.\nThe event lasts from October 01 to October 31,\nand you can can join it at any time.\n\nSee this blogpost for more information about Hacktoberfest in the Jenkins project.\n\nOnsite Hackathons\n\nHacktoberfest is not the only event happening in the Jenkins community this month,\nthere are also a number of upcoming on-site events:\n\nOct 19 -

large-scale Jenkins instances controller disk and network I/O become bottlenecks in particular cases.\nBuild logging and artifact storage were one for the most intensive I/O consumers,\nhence it would be great to somehow redirect them to an external storage.\nBack in 2016 there were active discussions about such Pluggable Storage for Jenkins.\nAt that point we created several prototypes, but then other work took precedence.\nThere was still a high demand in Pluggable Storage for large-scale instances,\nand these stories also become a major obstacle for cloud native Jenkins setups.\n\nI am happy to say that the Pluggable Storage discussions are back online.\nYou may have seen changes in the Core for Artifact Storage\n( JEP-202)\nand a new Artifact Manager for S3 plugin.\nWe have also created a number of JEPs for External Logging\nand created a new Cloud Native Special Interest Group (SIG)\nto offer a venue for discussing changes and to keep them as open as possible.\n\nTomorrow Jesse Glick and I will be\npresenting the current External Logging designs at the\nCloud Native SIG online meeting,\nyou can find more info about the meeting here.\nI decided that it is a good time to write about the new SIG.\nIn this blogpost I will try to provide my vision of the SIG and its purpose.\nI will also summarize the current status of the activities in the group.\n\nWhat are Special Interest Groups?\n\nIf you follow the developer mailing list,\nyou may have seen the discussion about introducing SIGs\nin the Jenkins project.\nThe SIG model has been proposed by\nR. Tyler Croy,\nand it largely follows the successful\nKubernetes SIG model.\nThe objective of these SIGs is to make the community more transparent to contributors\nand to offer venues for specific discussions.\nThe idea of SIGs and how to create them is documented in\nJEP-4.\nJEP-4 is still in Draft state, but a few SIGs have been already created using that process:\nPlatform SIG, GSoC SIG and, finally,\nCloud Native SIG.\n\nSIGs are a big opportunity to the Jenkins project,\noffering a new way to onboard contributors who are interested only in particular aspects of Jenkins.\nWith SIGs they can subscribe to particular topics without\nfollowing the entire Developer mailing list which can become pretty buzzy nowadays.\nIt also offers company contributors a clear way how to join community and participate in specific areas.\nThis is great for larger projects which cannot be done by a single contributor.\nLike JEPs, SIGs help focus and coordinate efforts.\n\nAnd, back to major efforts…​\nLack of resources among core contributors was one of the reasons\nwhy we did not deliver on Pluggable Storage stories back in 2016.\nI believe that SIGs can help fix that in Jenkins,\nmaking it easier to find groups with the same interests and\nreach out to them in order to organize activity.\nRegular meetings are also helpful to get such efforts moving.\n\nPoints above are the main reasons why I joined the Cloud Native SIG.\nSimilarly, that’s why I decided to create a Platform SIG\nto deliver on major efforts like Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nI hope that more SIGs get created soon so that contributors could focus on areas of their interest.\n\nCloud Native SIG\n\nIn the original proposal Carlos Sanchez,\nthe Cloud Native SIG chair, has described the purpose of the SIG well.\nThere has been great progress this year in cloud-native-minded projects like Jenkins X and Jenkins Evergreen,\nbut the current Jenkins architecture does not offer particular\nfeatures which could be utilized there:\nPluggable Storage, High Availability, etc.\nThere are ways to achieve it using Jenkins plugins and some infrastructure tweaks,\nbut it is far from the out-of-the-box experience.\nIt complicates Jenkins management and slows down development of new cloud-native solutions for Jenkins.\n\nSo, what do I expect from the SIG?\n\nDefine roadmap towards Cloud-Native Jenkins architecture\nwhich will help the project to stay relevant for Cloud Native installations\n\nProvide a venue for discussion of critical Jenkins architecture changes\n\nAct as a steering committee for Jenkins Enhancement Proposals in the area of\nCloud-Native solutions\n\nFinally, coordinate efforts between contributors and get new\ncontributors onboard\n\nWhat’s next in the SIG?\n\nThe SIG agenda is largely defined by the SIG participants.\nIf you are interested to discuss particular topics,\njust propose them in the SIG mailing list.\nAs the current SIG page describes,\nthere are several areas defined as initial topics:\nArtifact Storage,\nLog Storage,\nConfiguration Storage\n\nAll these topics are related to the Pluggable Storage Area,\nand the end goal for them is to ensure that all data is externalized\nso that replication becomes possible.\nIn addition to the mentioned data types,\ndiscussed at the Jenkins World 2016 summit,\nwe will need to externalize other data types:\nItem and Run storage,\nFingerprints,\nTest and coverage results,\netc.\nThere is some foundation work being done for that.\nFor example, Shenyu Zheng is working on a\nCode Coverage API plugin\nwhich would allow to unify the code coverage storage formats in Jenkins.\n\nOnce the Pluggable Storage stories are done the next steps are true High Availability, rolling or canary upgrades and zero downtime.\nAt that point other foundation stories like Remoting over Kafka\nby Pham Vu Tuan\nmight be integrated into the Cloud Native architecture to make Jenkins more robust against outages within the cluster.\nIt will take some time to get to this state, but it can be done incrementally.\n\nLet me briefly summarize current state of the 3 focuses listed in the Cloud Native SIG.\n\nArtifact Storage\n\nThere are many existing plugins allowing to upload and download artifacts from external storage\n(e.g. S3, Artifactory, Publish over SFTP, etc., etc.),\nbut there are no plugins which can do it transparently without using\nnew steps.\nIn many cases the artifacts also get uploaded through the controller,\nand it increases load on the system.\nIt would be great if there was a layer which would allow storing artifacts externally\nwhen using common steps like Archive Artifacts.\n\nArtifact storage work was started this spring by Jesse Glick, Carlos Sanchez and\nIvan Fernandez Calvo\nbefore the Cloud Native SIG was actually founded.\nCurrent state:\n\nJEP-202 \"External Artifact Storage\"\nhas been proposed in the Jenkins community.\nThis JEP defines API changes in the Jenkins core which are needed to\nsupport External artifact managers\n\nJenkins Pipeline has been updated to support external artifact storages\nfor archive / unarchive and stash / unstash\n\nNew Artifact Manager for S3 plugin\nreference implementation of the new API.\nThe plugin is available in main Jenkins update centers\n\nA number of plugins has been updated in order to support\nexternal artifact storage\n\nThe Artifact Manager API is available in Jenkins LTS starting from 2.121.1,\nso it is possible to create new implementations using the provided API and\nexisting implementations.\nThis new feature is fully backward compatible with the default Filesystem-based storage,\nbut there are known issues for plugins explicitly relying on artifact locations in JENKINS_HOME\n(you can find a list of such plugins\nhere).\nIt will take a while to get all plugins supported,\nbut the new API in the core should allow migrating plugins.\n\nI hope we will revisit the External Artifact Storage at the SIG meetings at some point.\nIt would be a good opportunity to do a retrospective and to understand how to improve the process\nin SIG.\n\nLog storage\n\nLog storage is a separate big story.\nBack in 2016 External logging was one of the key Pluggable Storage stories we defined at the contributor summit.\nWe created an EPIC for the story ( JENKINS-38313)\nand after that created a number of prototypes together with\nXing Yan and Jesse Glick.\nOne of these prototypes for Pipeline has recently been updated and published\nhere.\n\nJesse Glick and Carlos Sanchez\nare returning to this story and plan to discuss it within the Cloud Native SIG.\nThere are a number of Jenkins Enhancement proposals which have been submitted recently:\n\njep:207[] -\nExternal Build Logging support in the Jenkins Core\n\njep:210[] -\nExternal log storage for Pipeline\n\njep:212[] -\nExternal Logging API Plugin\n\njep:206[] -\nUse UTF-8 for Pipeline build logs\n\nIn the linked documents you can find references to current reference implementations.\nSo far we have a working prototype for the new design.\nThere are still many bits to fix before the final release,\nbut the designs are ready for review and feedback.\n\nThis Tuesday (Jul 31) we are going to have a SIG meeting in order to present the current state and to discuss the proposed designs and JEPs.\nThe meeting will happen at 3PM UTC.\nYou can watch the broadcast using this link.\nParticipant link will be posted in the SIGs Gitter channel 10 minutes before the meeting.\n\nConfiguration storage\n\nThis is one of the future stories we would like to consider.\nAlthough configurations are not big, externalizing them is a critical task\nfor getting highly-available or disposable Jenkins controllers.\nThere are many ways to store configurations in Jenkins,\nbut 95% of cases are covered by the XmlFile layer which\nserializes objects to disk and reads them using the XStream library.\nExternalizing these XmlFile s would be a great step forward.\n\nThere are several prototypes for externalizing configurations,\ne.g. in DotCI.\nThere are also other implementations which could be upstreamed to the Jenkins core:\n\nAlex Nordlund has recently proposed a\npull request\nto Jenkins Core, which should make the XML Storage pluggable\n\nJames Strachan has implemented similar engine\nfor Kubernetes in the kubeify prototype\n\nI also did some experiments with externalizing XML Storages back in 2016\n\nThe next steps for this story would be to aggregate implementations into a single JEP.\nI have it in my queue, and I hope to write up a design once we get more clarity on the External logging stories.\n\nConclusions\n\nSpecial Interest Groups are a new format for collaboration and disucssion in the Jenkins community.\nAlthough we have had some work groups before (Infrastructure, Configuration-as-Code, etc.),\nintroduction of SIGs sets a new bar in terms of the project transparency and consistency.\nMajor architecture changes in Jenkins are needed to ensure its future in the new environments,\nand SIGs will help to boost visibility and participation around these changes.\n\nIf you want to know more about the Cloud Native SIG,\nall resources are listed on the SIG’s page on jenkins.io.\nIf you want to participate in the SIG’s activities, just do the following:\n\nSubscribe to the mailing list\n\nJoin our Gitter channel\n\nJoin our public meetings\n\nI am also working on organizing a face-to-face Cloud Native SIG meeting at the\nJenkins Contributor Summit,\nwhich will happen on September 17 during\nDevOps World | Jenkins World in San Francisco.\nIf you come to DevOps World | Jenkins World,\nplease feel free to join us at the contributor summit or to meet us at the community booth.\nTogether with Jesse and Carlos we are also going to present some bits of our work at the\nA Cloud Native Jenkins talk.\n\nStay tuned for more updates and demos on the Cloud-Native Jenkins fronts!","title":"Introducing Jenkins Cloud Native
