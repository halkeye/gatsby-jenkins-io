How do I apply?\n\nSee Information for students for application guidelines.\n\nFirst step is to join discussions in the mailing lists in order to introduce yourself, establish connections with the community and potential mentors.\nThe application period starts on March 12 and ends on March 27, but don’t let it misguide you!\nUse time before application to discuss project ideas/proposals with mentors and to process their feedback.\nTo create a better proposal, we also recommend to study Jenkins and to do some contributions in the area of your project proposal.\n\nNot satisfied by the current project ideas?\nYou can propose your own idea\nin the developer mailing list.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt’s not!\nIf you are passionate about open-source and Jenkins, we invite you to join the mentors team.\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee Call for Mentors and Information for mentors for details.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nImportant dates\n\nMar 05 - deadline for new GSoC project idea proposals\n\nMar 12 - student application period starts\n\nMar 27 - deadline for student applications\n\nApr 23 - accepted projects announced, community bonding starts\n\nMay 14 - coding period starts\n\nAug 06 - end of the coding period\n\nSee the GSoC Timeline for more info.\nIn the Jenkins project we will also organize special events during and after GSoC (e.g. at Jenkins world).\n\nP.S: I am going to create a special GSoC 2018 edition of swags for mentors and students.

for plugins.\nFor comparison, in 2016 there were only 6 security releases in total.\n\nThere were 2605 plugin releases, and 215 NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.\nIn particular Jenkins ecosystem has greatly expanded into the Cloud space\nby offering dozens of new plugins (e.g. for Azure and Kubernetes).\nWe also got many new plugins providing integrations with various Development and DevOps tools.\n\nOther subprojects and Jenkins components also got major updates.\nFor example,\nJenkins Remoting got 15 releases with stability improvements.\nStapler Framework also got 6 releases.\n\nKeep updating, Jenkins 2 is not only about Pipeline as Code!\n\nEvents\n\nThis year we got many new Jenkins Area Meetups.\nCurrently there are 77 meetups with more than 20,000 members in total ( full map).\nMore than 100 meetups have been organized around the globe.\n\nThere were also several Jenkins-focused conferences including the following ones:\n\nJenkins World in San-Francisco\n\nJenkins User Conferences in Israel and Shanghai\n\nDays Of Jenkins in Gothenburg and Oslo\n\nJenkins Community Day in Paris\n\nJenkins Days in Amsterdam\n\nCloudBees | Jenkins Automotive and Embedded Day in Stuttgart\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nNext year we will have traditional contributor meeting at FOSDEM\nand at Jenkins World 2018.\nIf you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join the contributor summits/hackathons.\nWe also want to participate in Google Summer of Code 2018,\nand currently we are looking for mentors.\n\nStay tuned, there is much more to come next year!","title":"Happy New Year!","tags":["community","new-year-blogpost"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","id":"7d593bd4-902a-54dd-abb6-7db358ec7152","slug":"/blog/2017/10/06/hacktoberfest/","strippedHtml":"Once again it’s October in our calendars.\nIt means that the regular Hacktoberfest event is back!\nDuring this one-month hackathon you can support open source and earn a limited edition T-shirt.\nJenkins project offers an opportunity to participate in the project\nand to get reviews and help from Jenkins contributors.\n\nHow do I sign up?\n\nSign-up to Hacktoberfest on the event website.\n\nEverything is set, just start coding!\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nThere are lots of ways to contribute to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest.\nYou can…​\n\nWrite code\n\nImprove documentation,\nwrite blogposts\n\nAutomate Tests\n\nTranslate and internationalize components\n\nDesign -

Adoption of Jenkins 2, which featured \"Pipeline as code\" and\nencouraged users to adopt Jenkins Pipeline, has\nskyrocketed to more than half of all Jenkins installations.  Other data\nremained consistent with findings year-to-year, for example, the number of\nJenkins users continues to increase and 90% of survey respondents still\nconsider Jenkins mission-critical.\n\nGet the survey infographic PDF\n\nGet the complete survey results in PDF\n\nHere are some of the key findings:\n\n85% of respondants indicated that Jenkins usage had increased\n\n30% of organizations with more than 50 software projects used Jenkins in 2016 as compared to 16% in 2015\n\nAn impressive 46% of respondents were running Jenkins 2.x, eight months after\nits release.\n\nAdoption of Jenkins Pipeline for continuous delivery\n(CD) is accelerating, 54% of respondents who have adopted CD are using Pipeline.\n\n61% of respondents are deploying changes to production at least once per week\n\nLinux is the platform of choice for builds, favored by 85% of respondents\n\n85% of respondants use Git as the source code repository\n\nHalf of respondents are deploying applications directly to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services as the favored platform\n\nWe want to thank everyone for completing the survey, and congratulations to\nIker Garcia for winning a free pass to\nJenkins World 2017 and to\nDave Leifer for winning the Amazon gift card.\n\nWe’re looking forward to creating a 2017 Community Survey later this year and\nhearing more from users at Jenkins World 2017 in San Francisco, we hope to\nsee you there!","title":"The State of Jenkins - 2016 Community Survey","tags":["community","survey","continuous delivery"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"community","limit":8,"skip":72,"numPages":10,"currentPage":10}},
