CloudBees’ contributions to Jenkins include developing Pipeline and Blue Ocean, staffing the infrastructure team, advocacy and events work, as well as security efforts. My focus is on making sure there is a great relationship between the Jenkins community and CloudBees, which means strong communication, help get traction on things the community wants, and generally working to make Jenkins and the community thrive and stay awesome in an ever-changing tech landscape.\n\nHere’s a little background on me: I come from an electronics/EDA background but switched to software early in my career when I first got involved with open source software. I’ve been part of the Eclipse community for around 15 years, definitely from before git was even a thing. I love being involved with all levels: project committer, conference chair, steering committee for working groups and more recently board of directors.\n\nOn a personal note, I …\n\nLive in the UK with my husband and 2 young kids\n\nGrew up in Kenya\n\nEnjoy playing badminton, love good food & am always first at any buffets\n\nI am looking forward to getting to know the Jenkins community well, and really getting a feel for your Jenkins stories, good and bad. Please feel free to let me know:\n\nWhat you love about the Jenkins community & how you are using Jenkins\n\nWhat you’re working on doing with Jenkins\n\nWhat you don’t like and want improved\n\nYou can find me on the mailing lists or via:\n\nTwitter @tracymiranda\n\nEmail: tmiranda@cloudbees.com\n\nIRC: tracymiranda\n\nAlso I’ll be at the upcoming events: DevOps World - Jenkins World in San Francisco, California and Nice, France so if you plan to attend do come and say hi. The Jenkins community is the real force behind Jenkins. And in turn Jenkins powers so much of the software out there. It is an honour to be joining this wonderful community.","title":"Introducing Tracy Miranda as the CloudBees Open Source Program

year, news of compromised passwords being used for accounts able to distribute NPM packages made the rounds.\n\nTheir system looks similar to how publishing of plugins works in the Jenkins project:\n\nAccounts are protected by passwords chosen by users.\n\nIndividual contributors have permission to release the components they maintain.\n\nThe components they release are used by millions of developers around the world to deliver their software.\n\nIn other words, weak passwords are a problem for us just as much as for NPM, and what happened to them could happen to us.\n\nTo address this problem, the Jenkins security and infra teams have recently collaborated on a password audit.\nThe audit covered all accounts with permissions to upload plugins and components, and on accounts with other levels of privileged infrastructure access.\nWe ran brute force tools on salted password hashes of those accounts looking for \"weak\" passwords — passwords present in a set of publicly available password lists we chose for this audit.\n\nWe checked the password of every qualifying account for every unsafe password rather than trying to match them to any previous password leaks' email/password pairs.\nUsers with weak account passwords were notified via email a few weeks ago and were asked to change their password to something stronger.\n\nWe performed the same checks over the previous weekend, but this time we only checked the passwords of accounts whose passwords were deemed weak during our first check.\nWe then invalidated the password of any account whose password was still not considered \"strong\" (i.e. their password was unchanged or had been changed to another weak password).\nUsers of those accounts will need to request a password reset before signing in again.\n\nWe plan to implement further safeguards, including improving the account management app at https://accounts.jenkins.io to reject weak passwords.\nIf you’re interested in helping the security team make Jenkins more secure, let us know on the jenkinsci-dev mailing list, or request to join the security team.","title":"Jenkins community account password
