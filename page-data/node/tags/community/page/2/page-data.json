Over a hundred of you have already shared your innovations, and they just keep coming.  It comes as no surprise that many of the submitted stories are from IT consultants and software developers around the world building next-generation DevOps and CI/CD platforms to fuel the modernization of enterprise companies far and wide.\n\nThat’s why we’ve dedicated our latest eBook to focus on Jenkins users in the global Information Technology sector.  We shine the spotlight on these developers and engineers who have solved unique software development and DevOps challenges by turning to the leading open source automation server.  From powering large enterprises needing a better way to manage their inventory to innovative tech firms looking to advance technologies and healthcare initiatives during a pandemic, you’ll read about how teams everywhere solved their unique challenges — with the help of Jenkins.\n\nJenkins is the Way to…\n\nIn our short User Story Survey, we ask Jenkins users to fill in the blank: Jenkins is the way to …​…​\n\nWe’ve seen results-oriented submissions like \"Jenkins is the way to deliver our new releases on time!\" and \"Jenkins is the way to understand and simplify your software workflows.\"  Several submissions riffed off of something like \"Jenkins is the way to completely automate your CI/CD workflow.\"  Meanwhile, others have had a bit more fun and languished praise on Jenkins, stating, \"Jenkins is the way to help teams focus on what is really important, make our life easier\" and, even, \"Jenkins is the way to save the day.\"\n\nIn this new eBook, we focus on the challenges users in the community face, and what they’ve built using Jenkins to achieve their unique goals. For example, Build & Release Manager, Donald Morton, turned to Jenkins to establish a flexible, modern, and more efficient DevOps platform for Graylog, a leading log management platform serving the enterprise.\n\nWith a Jenkins assist, Mark Baumann, DevOps Engineer with ITK Engineering, created “ one CI to rule them all.” He told us that “Jenkins provides a common CI/CD platform for all different kinds of projects and technology domains.”\n\nWhen IBM Lead Software Engineer Alec Rieger sought to simplify the build and testing pipeline for the company’s software engineers and developers, he also turned to Jenkins.  For a company the size of IBM, which services enterprise clients worldwide, Rieger wanted to help his colleagues manage many nodes on a large scale. Now, according to his Jenkins Is The Way user story, IBM uses Jenkins pipelines for each of their builds and relies on the flexibility and countless plugin features to continually improve their processes.\n\nStronger, Smarter, Faster Software Innovation\n\nWhile we all fondly think of Jenkins as a modest butler who has empowered developers with the open-source tools they need to succeed — on JenkinsIsTheWay.io, we liken him to an unpretentious, yet powerful superhero.  And like any great superhero, he (or she!) is sure to save the day.\n\nFor our Jenkins users, that means results — significant, measurable results with a common theme.  Using Jenkins has enabled you — the user — to help the businesses you serve save money, spin up software faster, and automate processes.  In doing so, you’ve freed up developers and engineers from countless hours of mundane tasks.  Thanks to Jenkins, you’re empowering entire IT teams to innovate, focus on what they love to do and, ultimately, build great stuff.\n\nOf course, we devote much of our latest eBook to those victories.  Results like how RedHat’s releases are 5x faster thanks to Jenkins.  The fact that DevOps problem tickets were reduced by over 90% for Electronic Health Solutions.  And why the CTO at Cloudologia was psyched to share that — with a Jenkins at the helm — they were able to shorten onboarding for deployment & build release cycles from one week to a single day.\n\nShare Your User Story, Too!\n\nI am proud to share another common theme from the users who have submitted their story:  you turn to our community for collaboration, guidance, and advice.  A community of a million strong and growing, this eBook and JenkinsIsTheWay.io are other ways to provide you with the insight and lessons learned by developers and engineers, like you, to innovate and build next-generation technologies for companies of all sizes.\n\nWhen you’re ready to tell your story, we’re prepared to help you share it. Fill out our short questionnaire, and we’ll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt as a thank you once it’s published!\n\nLinks\n\nJenkins IsThe Way.

of initiatives to happen:\n Jenkins and Kubernetes ecosystem, terminology changes, GSoC and GSoD, pipeline authoring SIG and many more activities.\nThank you Marky!\n\nThe governance board has followed the interim procedure\nto nominate the new governance board member until the end of the term.\nThe board decided to respect the results of the 2020 elections and\nto nominate Ewelina Wilkosz who received the most of the votes after the elected candidates.\nShe has accepted the nomination, and on March 10th the Governance Meeting has confirmed it.\nWe are happy to welcome Ewelina Wilkosz as a new Governance Board Member!\n\nEwelina will join other governance Board Members:\nKohsuke Kawaguchi,\nUllrich Hafner,\nOleg Nenashev, and\nGavin Mogan.\nThe term will last until December 2022.\n\nAbout Ewelina Wilkosz\n\nEwelina has been a Jenkins Contributor since 2017, when she got involved in Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin development.\nVoted Most Valuable Jenkins Contributor in 2018.\nShe has 14 years of experience in IT, working as a CI/CD consultant since the beginning of 2017.\nIn that role she’s trying to solve numerous issues Jenkins users are facing daily - as developers, administrators, maintainers.\n\nHere is Ewelina’s statement from the elections:\n\nAs a consultant I support my customers with their Jenkins issues since the beginning of 2017.\nAnd almost from the start it was some kind of \"as code\" approach.\nThe experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.\nI consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.\nI appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is.\n\nI am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience\nwith Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.\nEvery day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.\nAs a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.\n\nThanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development\nI had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations\nwhere I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.\nHere are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:\nblogpost,\ncdCON presentation,\npodcast recording.\nSo my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,\nso I actually know what they need and why.\n\nWhat’s next for the Jenkins Governance Board?\n\nIn February we had the Jenkins Contributor Summit.\nThere we discussed many topics related to the Jenkins evolution and its roadmap.\nWe identified several initiatives we would like to focus on,\nincluding but not limited to improving user experience, contributor onboarding, and securing Jenkins delivery pipelines.\nThese initiatives will be a key focus until the next contributor summit we plan to organize in June.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and facilitating contributions to the project.\n\nParticipating in Jenkins Governance\n\nJenkins Governance Board has just a representative function in the community.\nThe project and the community have a long history of open and inclusive governance driven by many contributors.\nWe invite all community members to participate in the project by joining the\ngovernance meeting,\nparticipating in the mailing list conversations,\nand joining special interest groups driving particular topics.\n\nSee this page to know more about contributing to Jenkins in general.","title":"Welcome Ewelina Wilkosz - new Jenkins Governance Board

Contributhon\n\nThe Jenkins project has been accepted as a Contributhon mentoring organization.\nOur project idea will introduce participants to Jenkins and plugin development as they create Pipeline examples and create Pipeline help for Jenkins Pipeline plugins.\nParticipants will learn more about Jenkins Pipeline and will submit plugin pull requests with examples and online help.\n\nThe Jenkins Pipeline Steps Reference and Pipeline online help often receive feedback that more examples are needed, that step return values need to be described, and that arguments need more description of their purpose, allowed values, and expected results.\nMost plugin maintainers do not provide detailed documentation of the pipeline steps, or the arguments to those pipeline steps.\nThis project will improve the documentation of pipeline steps and their arguments while introducing Jenkins Pipeline, Jenkins plugin development, Jenkins documentation as code, and the concepts of GitHub forks and pull requests.\n\nWe’ve identified development tasks that up to three Contributhon participants will complete during April.\nThe tasks will introduce the participants to Jenkins plugin development.\nThey will experiment with plugin changes in Jenkins and submit pull requests to provide Pipeline examples and help.\nThey will meet twice a week with Jenkins mentors, Kristin Whetstone, Mark Waite, and Meg McRoberts to review their progress, provide coaching, and help with issues.\n\nData driven choices\n\nWe’ve been collecting Jenkins documentation feedback since 2017.\nNow we’re using that feedback to prioritize the plugins to improve as part of this project.\nThe top 10 Pipeline plugins that have received the most feedback are:\n\nBuild step\n\nSCM step\n\nGit step\n\nInput step\n\nNodes and processes steps\n\nWorkspace cleanup step\n\nBasic Pipeline steps\n\nSlack notification steps\n\nHTTP request step\n\nEmail extension steps\n\nWhat about my plugin?\n\nIf you are a plugin maintainer

behalf of the Jenkins GSoC org team,\nI am happy to announce that this year, for the first time, the Jenkins projects will be participating in\nGoogle Summer of Code 2021\nas part of the\nContinuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) GSoC organization.\n\nWe’re very excited to have the Jenkins project participate in GSoC as part the CDF mentoring organisation along with\nfellow CDF projects such as Ortelius, Screwdriver, Spinnaker, and Tekton. We believe that being part of the CDF\nGSoC org will create an environment for students with even more mentoring channels, potential cross-fertilization of ideas,\nand an even greater community of DevOps practitioners to join!\n\nWhat’s next?\nGSoC is officially announced, and please expect more students to contact projects in our\nGitter channels and mailing lists.\nMany communications will also happen in SIG and sub-project channels.\nAlso, please join the gsoc channel on the /\">CDF Slack.\nWe will be working hard in order to help students to find interesting projects, to explore the area,\nand to prepare their project proposals before the deadline on April 13th.\nThen we will process the applications, select projects and assign mentor teams.\n\nAll information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its sub-project page.\n\nI am a student. How do I apply?\n\nSee the Information for students page for full application guidelines.\n\nWe encourage interested students to reach out to the Jenkins community early and to start exploring project ideas.\nAll project ideas have chats and mailing lists referenced on their pages.\nWe will be also organizing office hours for students,\nand you can use these meetings to meet org admins and mentors and to ask questions.\nAlso, join our Gitter channel and the\nmailing list\nto receive information about such incoming events in the project.\n\nThe application period starts on March 29th, but you can prepare now!\nUse the time before the application period to discuss and improve your project proposals.\nWe also recommend that you become familiar with Jenkins and start exploring your proposal areas.\nProject ideas include quick-start guidelines and reference newbie-friendly issues\nwhich may help with initial study.\nIf you do not see anything interesting,\nyou can propose your own project idea\nor check out ideas proposed by other CDF organizations\nparticipating in GSoC.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt’s not!\nWe are looking for more project ideas and for Jenkins contributors/users\nwho are passionate about Jenkins and want to mentor students.\nNo hardcore experience required, mentors can study the project internals together with students and technical advisors.\nWe are especially interested in ideas beyond the Java stack, and in ideas focusing new technologies and areas\n(e.g. Kubernetes, IoT, Python, Go, whatever).\n\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee the Call for Mentors post\nand Information for mentors for details.\nIf you want to propose a new project,\nplease do so as soon as possible so that students have time to explore them and to prepare their proposals.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nTestimonials from former Jenkins GSoC participants ❤️\n\n\"I participated in Google Summer of Code 2020 in cooperation with the Jenkins organization\nand I work on a project called Windows Service Wrapper, which allows running Jenkins as a service on a Windows machine.\nGSoC was the most wonderful and the most valuable experience I gained during my student life.\nThe whole journey was full of experiences and Jenkins mentors always were there for us.\nI experienced a huge development of my skills while I was working on the project.\nI had many meetings, knowledge sharing sessions, and one pair-coding session with my mentors.\nOne of the best things that I learned is the open-source community and open source mentality.\nIt is not only about taking, but also about giving.\nToday I am maintaining an open-source project which is a simple programming language for kids\nwhich allows them to code in their native language, which will help to learn coding to students in rural areas of my country.\nFinally, Jenkins is a wonderful family and they always were there for us in all the ups and downs.\nI am proud to be a part of the Jenkins community.\"\n\nBuddhika Chathuranga, GSoC 2020 student, Support for YAML Configuration in Windows Service Wrapper\n\n\"My GSoC journey in the Jenkins community starts by a draft proposal full of comments from mentors and ends by two plugins with hundreds of installations.\nAlong with the daily coding review, the weekly meeting and the growth of the project,\nI increased my skills on programming and became a much more eligible engineer.\nWhat is more, the support from the whole Jenkins community leads me to a broader career path.\nI learned how to maintain a project, how to communicate with users and other developers on GitHub.\nMost importantly, the Jenkins community teaches me the principles of the open source world\nand welcomes me to the open source world with all their kind help.\"\n\nKezhi Xiong, GSoC 2020 students, GitHub Checks API project\n\n\"I worked as a Google Summer of Code student with the Jenkins project during the summer of 2019.\nThe project provided me with an excellent opportunity to contribute to the world’s most popular automation server,\nlearn about building performant and reliable applications, and interact with awesome people around the globe.\nJenkins' ever helpful and extremely knowledgeable community made working on my project a real treat.\nI even got a chance to present my project at DevOps World in Lisbon!\nIf you’re deciding which organization to work for this year, choose the Jenkins project — you can’t have a better GSoC experience than this!\"\n\nAbhyudaya Sharma, GSoC 2019 student, Role Strategy Performance Improvements\n\n\"I participated in Google Summer of Code 2018 with Jenkins as a student developer.\nWorking for Jenkins in GSoC 2018 was one of the best experiences I have ever had.\nDuring 3 months of summer, I learned a lot of new things when working on the open-source project with Jenkins.\nAnother best thing about Jenkins is the people, I received a lot of support from my mentors\nand other developers from the Jenkins community when working on my project.\nAfter GSoC, I also had a chance to go to the Jenkins World Conference in San Francisco\nto meet and connect with my mentors and other people in the Jenkins community.\nOverall, GSoC with Jenkins was a great experience and\nI highly recommend Jenkins as a great community to kickstart your open source journey.\"\n\nPham Vu Tuan, GSoC 2018 student, Remoting over Apache Kafka project\n\nImportant dates for GSoC 2021\n\nApr 13 - deadline for student applications\n\nMay 17 - accepted projects announced, teams start community bonding and coding\n\nAug 16 - coding period ends\n\nAug 31 - Results announced\n\nSee the GSoC Timeline for more info.","title":"Jenkins accepted in Google Summer Of Code

Jenkins community congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!\nLet’s take a look at some changes this year.\nWe would like to thank all awesome Jenkins users and contributors who have been with us during this year.\n\nHighlights\n\nSome of the key highlights:\n\nHundreds of first-timer contributors joined the community\n\nMajor UI/UX improvements in the Jenkins core, including the landing page, plugin manager, dark theme, and read-only configurations support\n\nOutreach programs like Google Summer of Code (7 projects), Google Season of Docs, UI/UX hackfest, etc.\n\nPublic roadmap for the project\n\nTerminology changes in the project, new Code of Conduct\n\nTechnical debt cleanup: XStream unforking, Acegi Security replacement, etc.\n\nContinued evolution of the plugin ecosystem, especially in the area of Cloud Native solutions and tool integrations\n\nContinued documentation cleanup, great progress with plugin documentation migration\n\nGraduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins User Interface and User Experience\n\nThis year there were many activities around Jenkins user experience and long-anticipated user interface changes.\nThis is a coordinated effort being led by the User Experience SIG, and by many contributors to the project.\nKey project highlights:\n\nLook & Feel updates of the Jenkins Web UI, including styling rework, new typography and layouts\n\nMajor rework of plugin management UI/UX\n\nDark theme for Jenkins\n\nAccessibility improvements\n\nSupport for read-only configuration pages\n\nIn May we also organized a Jenkins UI/UX hackfest where we worked on some key stories improving user experience.\n\nJenkins security\n\nIn 2020 the Jenkins security team has released 19 advisories for the Jenkins core, plugins and other components.\nIn total 198 vulnerabilities were fixed, and 72 plugin vulnerabilities were announced without a fix at the time of advisory publishing.\nAs a project, we are receiving a continuous flow of new reports and continue to provide corrections.\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were the most popular type this year, followed by unprotected credentials.\n\nThere have also been developer tooling improvements,\nincluding GitHub CodeQL evaluation for targeted security issues search\nand Find-Sec-Bugs adoption for static analysis of the plugin and Jenkins core code.\nAlong with wider adoption of Dependabot and automated dependency scanning on GitHub.\n\nDocumentation\n\nJenkins Documentation SIG is working on creating more documentation for Jenkins on different platforms,\nincluding cloud platforms.\nJenkins on Kubernetes was one of the key stories this year for the SIG,\nalong with documentation migration to jenkins.io and wider adoption of Documentation-as-code in plugins.\n95% of the 200 most installed Jenkins plugins have moved to \"documentation as code\" or have a pending pull request with updates.\nIn total, almost 600 plugins have already been migrated.\nThere were major updates in Jenkins documentation on jenkins.io, with a lot of content being moved from the old Jenkins Wiki.\n\n2020 was the first year when Jenkins participated in Google Season of Docs (GSoD).\nThis program brings together open-source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nThis year’s student, Zainab Abubakar,\ndid an amazing job documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nNow Jenkins users can find official documentation about deploying and scaling Jenkins in Kubernetes.\nSee the project report by Zainab here.\n\nJenkins Release Automation\n\nThe Jenkins project has delivered weekly and long term support releases since it was formed in 2011.\nThose releases were delivered by Kohsuke Kawaguchi from his release infrastructure.\n\nBeginning in April 2020, those releases are delivered by the new release automation setup.\nIt is hosted within the Jenkins’ Kubernetes cluster, with fully automated management and continuous delivery of services within the setup.\nWe transitioned to new build processes, new code signing certificates, and new release automation jobs.\nThanks to Olivier Vernin and all Infrastructure sub-project contributors for the successful completion of the release automation project!\n\nMoreover, there is ongoing work on continuous delivery of Jenkins plugins ( JEP-229) and on re-designing other Jenkins instances within the project (infra-ci, trusted-ci, and ci.jenkins.io for plugins).\nIn the next few months these stories should provide Jenkins contributors with a modern environment for CI and CD of all Jenkins components.\n\nTerminology updates\n\nSince July, we have officially replaced the old \"master\" terminology with the \"controller\" term.\nIt is a follow-up to the \"agent\" terminology introduced in 2016.\nWe have also deprecated usages of the “blacklist/whitelist” terminology in all components.\nCurrently the community is working on the cleanup of the remaining occurrences in the codebase and documentation, and we invite everyone to contribute.\n\nAs a part of the terminology cleanup, last spring we announced the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.\nAs a reminder, it does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.\n\nSee more information about terminology updates here and here.\n\n“Jenkins is the Way” program\n\nThis year the Advocacy and Outreach SIG started the “Jenkins is the Way” initiative which focuses on promoting user success stories.\nOver the year, the team published 54 user stories and six case studies on https://jenkinsistheway.io/ as well as a significant amount of community marketing.\nWe also published a number of testimonial videos advertising user stories,\nincluding this Introduction to \"Jenkins is the Way\" video.\n\nSee all the stories HERE\n\nEvents\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nIn 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.\nWe had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.\nAs usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.\nThe projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes needed for the long-term evolution of Jenkins.\n\nThis is the first-ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.\nIt was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!\n\nRead more: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/22/gsoc-report/\n\nJenkins in Hacktoberfest 2020\n\nIn October we participated in Hacktoberfest.\nOur featured projects included the Jenkins core, jenkins.io website and plugins.jenkins.io, Helm charts, and multiple plugins.\nWe also encouraged contributors to participate in the Documentation as Code and terminology cleanup across the entire Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nSee the details in the Hacktoberfest page.\n\nIn total we received 226 pull requests from Hacktoberfest participants.\nSome stats per Jenkins GitHub organization:\n\n'jenkinsci', PRs: 189, Hacktoberfest contributors: 61\n\n'jenkins-infra', PRs: 100, Hacktoberfest contributors: 40\n\n'jenkins-zh', PRs: 37, Hacktoberfest contributors: 2\n\nJenkins at DevOps World\n\nThe annual DevOps World,\nformerly known as DevOps World | Jenkins World held on Sept 22-24, with workshops on Sept 25.\nJust like other events in 2020, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that didn’t mean there was a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There were over 50 Jenkins/open-source.\nAnd a special congratulations is in order to this year’s Jenkins Contributor Award winners:\n\nJames Holderness - Jenkins security MVP\n\nMarky Jackson - Most valuable Jenkins advocate\n\nTim Jacomb - Most valuable Jenkins contributor\n\nBelow are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :\n\nJenkins Where It Is and Where It Is Going\n\nOne Jenkins to Rule them All\n\nJenkins UI Gets a Makeover\n\nJenkins Pipeline and DevSecOps for API Security\n\nGraduation at Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.\nIn August the project announced that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).\nThanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!\nBelow you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:\n\nWe introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.\nThis roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.\nIt makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters, and at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.\nThe roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in JEP-14.\n\nA new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.\nThis list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,\nincluding ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.\nPlease do not hesitate to add your company there!\n\nWe passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.\nThis certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices and to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).\nIt also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.\nDetails are on the Jenkins core page.\n\nJenkins Code of Conduct was updated to the new version of Contributor Covenant.\nIn particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.\n\nMore information can be found HERE, and HERE.\n\nPublic Roadmap\n\nThe Jenkins project now has a public, community-driven project roadmap.  Roadmap items are major initiatives and are considered as official plans.\nThe roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all areas of the project.\n\nMany of the 2020 released roadmap items are mentioned elsewhere in this document, including release automation, Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification,\nuser interface improvements, read-only configuration pages,\nand Google Summer of Code projects like the GitHub Checks API or External Fingerprint Storage.\n\nOther roadmap items include mirror infrastructure improvements, a new Windows installer,\nand preview releases of pluggable storage for external fingerprints, build logs, and unit test results.\n\nJenkins 2020 Elections\n\nIn October-December the Jenkins community held the regular elections.\nThis year we were  electing for 2 governance board members and for all five officer positions, namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation. These roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being. We thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.\n\nKey results:\n\nGavin Mogan and Marky Jackson joined the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nTim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer\n\nMarky Jackson became the new Events Officer\n\nOlivier Vernin, Daniel Beck, and Mark Waite will continue as Infrastructure, Security and Documentation officers\n\nFull election results: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/03/election-results/\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project,\nit is just a slice of the key highlights mentioned by the contributors.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day. We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size. Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc. THANKS A LOT TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTechnical changes. 2021 will be another busy year for the Jenkins community.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want Jenkins to succeed.\nThere are many areas on the roadmap : UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nThere will also be a continued cleanup of old dependencies and technical debt.\nSeveral key changes are expected to land in the March LTS baseline: update to Spring Security, XStream unforking, JQuery update, etc.( announcement).\nIn addition to that, we will keep working on expanding platform support in Jenkins, including provisioning support for new Java versions and official images for more architectures like Arm.\n\nDocumentation. Documentation efforts will continue in the next year,\nwith a focus on documenting Jenkins usage on modern platforms and and automation use-cases.\nWide adoption of documentation-as-code will also continue for plugins By this time almost 600 plugins have been migrated, but there are hundreds more plugins to go.\n\nSecurity. Another important area is Jenkins security. Automation tools like Jenkins are a key part of the software delivery process in organizations, and their security is essential for the security of products.\nMisconfigured or outdated systems are a common attack vector, but there are also areas for improvement on the project’s side.\nBe sure there will be security advisories and vulnerability fixes in 2021.\nWe plan to keep adopting best security development and software delivery practices, and to improve dependency management and developer tools in the project. These areas will be in the spotlight for the project next year.\n\nEvents. Next month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a virtual Jenkins stand there.\nThere will also be a CI/CD devroom.\nIf you are interested to meet Jenkins contributors, it is a great opportunity. We also plan to continue all outreach programs and on onboarding more contributors.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement).\nWe are also ready to consider other non-coding project ideas as a part of CommunityBridge.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nJoin us in 2021!\n\nWe are always looking for more contributors, regardless of the profile and experience.\nJenkins is a vast ecosystem which includes many modern technologies.\n\nWe invite Jenkins users and contributors to participate in the community and to move these initiatives forward!\nJoin us in the mailing lists and special interest groups,","title":"2020 A Year Like No Other","tags":["community","new-year-blogpost","governance"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!
