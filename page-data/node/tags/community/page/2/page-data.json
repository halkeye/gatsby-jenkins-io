like to announce changes in the Jenkins Governance Board.\nAs it was announced earlier this month, Marky Jackson has decided to step down from his elected roles.\nOn behalf of the Jenkins community, we would like to thank Marky for all contributions and for the continued participation in the Jenkins community.\nAs an active Jenkins contributor and community leader, Marky helped a lot of initiatives to happen:\n Jenkins and Kubernetes ecosystem, terminology changes, GSoC and GSoD, pipeline authoring SIG and many more activities.\nThank you Marky!\n\nThe governance board has followed the interim procedure\nto nominate the new governance board member until the end of the term.\nThe board decided to respect the results of the 2020 elections and\nto nominate Ewelina Wilkosz who received the most of the votes after the elected candidates.\nShe has accepted the nomination, and on March 10th the Governance Meeting has confirmed it.\nWe are happy to welcome Ewelina Wilkosz as a new Governance Board Member!\n\nEwelina will join other governance Board Members:\nKohsuke Kawaguchi,\nUllrich Hafner,\nOleg Nenashev, and\nGavin Mogan.\nThe term will last until December 2022.\n\nAbout Ewelina Wilkosz\n\nEwelina has been a Jenkins Contributor since 2017, when she got involved in Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin development.\nVoted Most Valuable Jenkins Contributor in 2018.\nShe has 14 years of experience in IT, working as a CI/CD consultant since the beginning of 2017.\nIn that role she’s trying to solve numerous issues Jenkins users are facing daily - as developers, administrators, maintainers.\n\nHere is Ewelina’s statement from the elections:\n\nAs a consultant I support my customers with their Jenkins issues since the beginning of 2017.\nAnd almost from the start it was some kind of \"as code\" approach.\nThe experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.\nI consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.\nI appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is.\n\nI am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience\nwith Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.\nEvery day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.\nAs a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.\n\nThanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development\nI had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations\nwhere I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.\nHere are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:\nblogpost,\ncdCON presentation,\npodcast recording.\nSo my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,\nso I actually know what they need and why.\n\nWhat’s next for the Jenkins Governance Board?\n\nIn February we had the Jenkins Contributor Summit.\nThere we discussed many topics related to the Jenkins evolution and its roadmap.\nWe identified several initiatives we would like to focus on,\nincluding but not limited to improving user experience, contributor onboarding, and securing Jenkins delivery pipelines.\nThese initiatives will be a key focus until the next contributor summit we plan to organize in June.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and facilitating contributions to the project.\n\nParticipating in Jenkins Governance\n\nJenkins Governance Board has just a representative function in the community.\nThe project and the community have a long history of open and inclusive governance driven by many contributors.\nWe invite all community members to participate in the project by joining the\ngovernance meeting,\nparticipating in the mailing list conversations,\nand joining special interest groups driving particular topics.\n\nSee this page to know more about contributing to Jenkins in general.","title":"Welcome Ewelina Wilkosz - new Jenkins Governance Board

Code Africa is a non-profit organization focused on celebrating and empowering young girls and women in technology across Africa.\nThey provide resources and events that help women grow and achieve their personal and career goals.\nTheir mentoring programs provide help and guidance as participants learn and grow in their careers.\n\nThis year, She Code Africa is organizing the She Code Africa Contributhon.\nContributhon is a boot camp where African women are paid to work with open source organizations on selected projects with dedicated mentors.\nThis program aims to create a more diverse, inclusive, and innovative culture within the African open source ecosystem by matching African women in technology with sponsor and mentor open source organizations.\n\nJenkins in She Code Africa Contributhon\n\nThe Jenkins project has been accepted as a Contributhon mentoring organization.\nOur project idea will introduce participants to Jenkins and plugin development as they create Pipeline examples and create Pipeline help for Jenkins Pipeline plugins.\nParticipants will learn more about Jenkins Pipeline and will submit plugin pull requests with examples and online help.\n\nThe Jenkins Pipeline Steps Reference and Pipeline online help often receive feedback that more examples are needed, that step return values need to be described, and that arguments need more description of their purpose, allowed values, and expected results.\nMost plugin maintainers do not provide detailed documentation of the pipeline steps, or the arguments to those pipeline steps.\nThis project will improve the documentation of pipeline steps and their arguments while introducing Jenkins Pipeline, Jenkins plugin development, Jenkins documentation as code, and the concepts of GitHub forks and pull requests.\n\nWe’ve identified development tasks that up to three Contributhon participants will complete during April.\nThe tasks will introduce the participants to Jenkins plugin development.\nThey will experiment with plugin changes in Jenkins and submit pull requests to provide Pipeline examples and help.\nThey will meet twice a week with Jenkins mentors, Kristin Whetstone, Mark Waite, and Meg McRoberts to review their progress, provide coaching, and help with issues.\n\nData driven choices\n\nWe’ve been collecting Jenkins documentation feedback since 2017.\nNow we’re using that feedback to prioritize the plugins to improve as part of this project.\nThe top 10 Pipeline plugins that have received the most feedback are:\n\nBuild step\n\nSCM step\n\nGit step\n\nInput step\n\nNodes and processes steps\n\nWorkspace cleanup step\n\nBasic Pipeline steps\n\nSlack notification steps\n\nHTTP request step\n\nEmail extension steps\n\nWhat about my plugin?\n\nIf you are a plugin maintainer and would like help to add examples and online help for the Pipeline steps in your plugin, send email to the Jenkins Documentation mailing list.\nWe’ll consider including additional plugins as we better understand the development pace for She Code Africa participants.","title":"Jenkins accepted in She Code Africa

behalf of the Jenkins GSoC org team,\nI am happy to announce that this year, for the first time, the Jenkins projects will be participating in\nGoogle Summer of Code 2021\nas part of the\nContinuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) GSoC organization.\n\nWe’re very excited to have the Jenkins project participate in GSoC as part the CDF mentoring organisation along with\nfellow CDF projects such as Ortelius, Screwdriver, Spinnaker, and Tekton. We believe that being part of the CDF\nGSoC org will create an environment for students with even more mentoring channels, potential cross-fertilization of ideas,\nand an even greater community of DevOps practitioners to join!\n\nWhat’s next?\nGSoC is officially announced, and please expect more students to contact projects in our\nGitter channels and mailing lists.\nMany communications will also happen in SIG and sub-project channels.\nAlso, please join the gsoc channel on the /\">CDF Slack.\nWe will be working hard in order to help students to find interesting projects, to explore the area,\nand to prepare their project proposals before the deadline on April 13th.\nThen we will process the applications, select projects and assign mentor teams.\n\nAll information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its sub-project page.\n\nI am a student. How do I apply?\n\nSee the Information for students page for full application guidelines.\n\nWe encourage interested students to reach out to the Jenkins community early and to start exploring project ideas.\nAll project ideas have chats and mailing lists referenced on their pages.\nWe will be also organizing office hours for students,\nand you can use these meetings to meet org admins and mentors and to ask questions.\nAlso, join our Gitter channel and the\nmailing list\nto receive information about such incoming events in the project.\n\nThe application period starts on March 29th, but you can prepare now!\nUse the time before the application period to discuss and improve your project proposals.\nWe also recommend that you become familiar with Jenkins and start exploring your proposal areas.\nProject ideas include quick-start guidelines and reference newbie-friendly issues\nwhich may help with initial study.\nIf you do not see anything interesting,\nyou can propose your own project idea\nor check out ideas proposed by other CDF organizations\nparticipating in GSoC.\n\nI want to be a mentor. Is it too late?\n\nIt’s not!\nWe are looking for more project ideas and for Jenkins contributors/users\nwho are passionate about Jenkins and want to mentor students.\nNo hardcore experience required, mentors can study the project internals together with students and technical advisors.\nWe are especially interested in ideas beyond the Java stack, and in ideas focusing new technologies and areas\n(e.g. Kubernetes, IoT, Python, Go, whatever).\n\nYou can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.\nSee the Call for Mentors post\nand Information for mentors for details.\nIf you want to propose a new project,\nplease do so as soon as possible so that students have time to explore them and to prepare their proposals.\n\nThis year mentorship does NOT require strong expertise in Jenkins development.\nThe objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.\nGSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.\n\nTestimonials from former Jenkins GSoC participants ❤️\n\n\"I participated in Google Summer of Code 2020 in cooperation with the Jenkins organization\nand I work on a project called Windows Service Wrapper, which allows running Jenkins as a service on a Windows machine.\nGSoC was the most wonderful and the most valuable experience I gained during my student life.\nThe whole journey was full of experiences and Jenkins mentors always were there for us.\nI experienced a huge development of my skills while I was working on the project.\nI had many meetings, knowledge sharing sessions, and one pair-coding session with my mentors.\nOne of the best things that I learned is the open-source community and open source mentality.\nIt is not only about taking, but also about giving.\nToday I am maintaining an open-source project which is a simple programming language for kids\nwhich allows them to code in their native language, which will help to learn coding to students in rural areas of my country.\nFinally, Jenkins is a wonderful family and they always were there for us in all the ups and downs.\nI am proud to be a part of the Jenkins community.\"\n\nBuddhika Chathuranga, GSoC 2020 student, Support for YAML Configuration in Windows Service Wrapper\n\n\"My GSoC journey in the Jenkins community starts by a draft proposal full of comments from mentors and ends by two plugins with hundreds of installations.\nAlong with the daily coding review, the weekly meeting and the growth of the project,\nI increased my skills on programming and became a much more eligible engineer.\nWhat is more, the support from the whole Jenkins community leads me to a broader career path.\nI learned how to maintain a project, how to communicate with users and other developers on GitHub.\nMost importantly, the Jenkins community teaches me the principles of the open source world\nand welcomes me to the open source world with all their kind help.\"\n\nKezhi Xiong, GSoC 2020 students, GitHub Checks API project\n\n\"I worked as a Google Summer of Code student with the Jenkins project during the summer of 2019.\nThe project provided me with an excellent opportunity to contribute to the world’s most popular automation server,\nlearn about building performant and reliable applications, and interact with awesome people around the globe.\nJenkins' ever helpful and extremely knowledgeable community made working on my project a real treat.\nI even got a chance to present my project at DevOps World in Lisbon!\nIf you’re deciding which organization to work for this year, choose the Jenkins project — you can’t have a better GSoC experience than this!\"\n\nAbhyudaya Sharma, GSoC 2019 student, Role Strategy Performance Improvements\n\n\"I participated in Google Summer of Code 2018 with Jenkins as a student developer.\nWorking for Jenkins in GSoC 2018 was one of the best experiences I have ever had.\nDuring 3 months of summer, I learned a lot of new things when working on the open-source project with Jenkins.\nAnother best thing about Jenkins is the people, I received a lot of support from my mentors\nand other developers from the Jenkins community when working on my project.\nAfter GSoC, I also had a chance to go to the Jenkins World Conference in San Francisco\nto meet and connect with my mentors and other people in the Jenkins community.\nOverall, GSoC with Jenkins was a great experience and\nI highly recommend Jenkins as a great community to kickstart your open source journey.\"\n\nPham Vu Tuan, GSoC 2018 student, Remoting over Apache Kafka project\n\nImportant dates for GSoC 2021\n\nApr 13 - deadline for student applications\n\nMay 17 - accepted projects announced, teams start community bonding and coding\n\nAug 16 - coding period ends\n\nAug 31 - Results announced\n\nSee the GSoC Timeline for more info.","title":"Jenkins accepted in Google Summer Of Code

landing page, plugin manager, dark theme, and read-only configurations support\n\nOutreach programs like Google Summer of Code (7 projects), Google Season of Docs, UI/UX hackfest, etc.\n\nPublic roadmap for the project\n\nTerminology changes in the project, new Code of Conduct\n\nTechnical debt cleanup: XStream unforking, Acegi Security replacement, etc.\n\nContinued evolution of the plugin ecosystem, especially in the area of Cloud Native solutions and tool integrations\n\nContinued documentation cleanup, great progress with plugin documentation migration\n\nGraduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins User Interface and User Experience\n\nThis year there were many activities around Jenkins user experience and long-anticipated user interface changes.\nThis is a coordinated effort being led by the User Experience SIG, and by many contributors to the project.\nKey project highlights:\n\nLook & Feel updates of the Jenkins Web UI, including styling rework, new typography and layouts\n\nMajor rework of plugin management UI/UX\n\nDark theme for Jenkins\n\nAccessibility improvements\n\nSupport for read-only configuration pages\n\nIn May we also organized a Jenkins UI/UX hackfest where we worked on some key stories improving user experience.\n\nJenkins security\n\nIn 2020 the Jenkins security team has released 19 advisories for the Jenkins core, plugins and other components.\nIn total 198 vulnerabilities were fixed, and 72 plugin vulnerabilities were announced without a fix at the time of advisory publishing.\nAs a project, we are receiving a continuous flow of new reports and continue to provide corrections.\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were the most popular type this year, followed by unprotected credentials.\n\nThere have also been developer tooling improvements,\nincluding GitHub CodeQL evaluation for targeted security issues search\nand Find-Sec-Bugs adoption for static analysis of the plugin and Jenkins core code.\nAlong with wider adoption of Dependabot and automated dependency scanning on GitHub.\n\nDocumentation\n\nJenkins Documentation SIG is working on creating more documentation for Jenkins on different platforms,\nincluding cloud platforms.\nJenkins on Kubernetes was one of the key stories this year for the SIG,\nalong with documentation migration to jenkins.io and wider adoption of Documentation-as-code in plugins.\n95% of the 200 most installed Jenkins plugins have moved to \"documentation as code\" or have a pending pull request with updates.\nIn total, almost 600 plugins have already been migrated.\nThere were major updates in Jenkins documentation on jenkins.io, with a lot of content being moved from the old Jenkins Wiki.\n\n2020 was the first year when Jenkins participated in Google Season of Docs (GSoD).\nThis program brings together open-source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nThis year’s student, Zainab Abubakar,\ndid an amazing job documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nNow Jenkins users can find official documentation about deploying and scaling Jenkins in Kubernetes.\nSee the project report by Zainab here.\n\nJenkins Release Automation\n\nThe Jenkins project has delivered weekly and long term support releases since it was formed in 2011.\nThose releases were delivered by Kohsuke Kawaguchi from his release infrastructure.\n\nBeginning in April 2020, those releases are delivered by the new release automation setup.\nIt is hosted within the Jenkins’ Kubernetes cluster, with fully automated management and continuous delivery of services within the setup.\nWe transitioned to new build processes, new code signing certificates, and new release automation jobs.\nThanks to Olivier Vernin and all Infrastructure sub-project contributors for the successful completion of the release automation project!\n\nMoreover, there is ongoing work on continuous delivery of Jenkins plugins ( JEP-229) and on re-designing other Jenkins instances within the project (infra-ci, trusted-ci, and ci.jenkins.io for plugins).\nIn the next few months these stories should provide Jenkins contributors with a modern environment for CI and CD of all Jenkins components.\n\nTerminology updates\n\nSince July, we have officially replaced the old \"master\" terminology with the \"controller\" term.\nIt is a follow-up to the \"agent\" terminology introduced in 2016.\nWe have also deprecated usages of the “blacklist/whitelist” terminology in all components.\nCurrently the community is working on the cleanup of the remaining occurrences in the codebase and documentation, and we invite everyone to contribute.\n\nAs a part of the terminology cleanup, last spring we announced the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.\nAs a reminder, it does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.\n\nSee more information about terminology updates here and here.\n\n“Jenkins is the Way” program\n\nThis year the Advocacy and Outreach SIG started the “Jenkins is the Way” initiative which focuses on promoting user success stories.\nOver the year, the team published 54 user stories and six case studies on https://jenkinsistheway.io/ as well as a significant amount of community marketing.\nWe also published a number of testimonial videos advertising user stories,\nincluding this Introduction to \"Jenkins is the Way\" video.\n\nSee all the stories HERE\n\nEvents\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nIn 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.\nWe had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.\nAs usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.\nThe projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes needed for the long-term evolution of Jenkins.\n\nThis is the first-ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.\nIt was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!\n\nRead more: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/22/gsoc-report/\n\nJenkins in Hacktoberfest 2020\n\nIn October we participated in Hacktoberfest.\nOur featured projects included the Jenkins core, jenkins.io website and plugins.jenkins.io, Helm charts, and multiple plugins.\nWe also encouraged contributors to participate in the Documentation as Code and terminology cleanup across the entire Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nSee the details in the Hacktoberfest page.\n\nIn total we received 226 pull requests from Hacktoberfest participants.\nSome stats per Jenkins GitHub organization:\n\n'jenkinsci', PRs: 189, Hacktoberfest contributors: 61\n\n'jenkins-infra', PRs: 100, Hacktoberfest contributors: 40\n\n'jenkins-zh', PRs: 37, Hacktoberfest contributors: 2\n\nJenkins at DevOps World\n\nThe annual DevOps World,\nformerly known as DevOps World | Jenkins World held on Sept 22-24, with workshops on Sept 25.\nJust like other events in 2020, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that didn’t mean there was a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There were over 50 Jenkins/open-source.\nAnd a special congratulations is in order to this year’s Jenkins Contributor Award winners:\n\nJames Holderness - Jenkins security MVP\n\nMarky Jackson - Most valuable Jenkins advocate\n\nTim Jacomb - Most valuable Jenkins contributor\n\nBelow are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :\n\nJenkins Where It Is and Where It Is Going\n\nOne Jenkins to Rule them All\n\nJenkins UI Gets a Makeover\n\nJenkins Pipeline and DevSecOps for API Security\n\nGraduation at Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.\nIn August the project announced that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).\nThanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!\nBelow you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:\n\nWe introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.\nThis roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.\nIt makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters, and at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.\nThe roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in JEP-14.\n\nA new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.\nThis list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,\nincluding ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.\nPlease do not hesitate to add your company there!\n\nWe passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.\nThis certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices and to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).\nIt also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.\nDetails are on the Jenkins core page.\n\nJenkins Code of Conduct was updated to the new version of Contributor Covenant.\nIn particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.\n\nMore information can be found HERE, and HERE.\n\nPublic Roadmap\n\nThe Jenkins project now has a public, community-driven project roadmap.  Roadmap items are major initiatives and are considered as official plans.\nThe roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all areas of the project.\n\nMany of the 2020 released roadmap items are mentioned elsewhere in this document, including release automation, Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification,\nuser interface improvements, read-only configuration pages,\nand Google Summer of Code projects like the GitHub Checks API or External Fingerprint Storage.\n\nOther roadmap items include mirror infrastructure improvements, a new Windows installer,\nand preview releases of pluggable storage for external fingerprints, build logs, and unit test results.\n\nJenkins 2020 Elections\n\nIn October-December the Jenkins community held the regular elections.\nThis year we were  electing for 2 governance board members and for all five officer positions, namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation. These roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being. We thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.\n\nKey results:\n\nGavin Mogan and Marky Jackson joined the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nTim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer\n\nMarky Jackson became the new Events Officer\n\nOlivier Vernin, Daniel Beck, and Mark Waite will continue as Infrastructure, Security and Documentation officers\n\nFull election results: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/03/election-results/\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project,\nit is just a slice of the key highlights mentioned by the contributors.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day. We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size. Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc. THANKS A LOT TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTechnical changes. 2021 will be another busy year for the Jenkins community.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want Jenkins to succeed.\nThere are many areas on the roadmap : UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nThere will also be a continued cleanup of old dependencies and technical debt.\nSeveral key changes are expected to land in the March LTS baseline: update to Spring Security, XStream unforking, JQuery update, etc.( announcement).\nIn addition to that, we will keep working on expanding platform support in Jenkins, including provisioning support for new Java versions and official images for more architectures like Arm.\n\nDocumentation. Documentation efforts will continue in the next year,\nwith a focus on documenting Jenkins usage on modern platforms and and automation use-cases.\nWide adoption of documentation-as-code will also continue for plugins By this time almost 600 plugins have been migrated, but there are hundreds more plugins to go.\n\nSecurity. Another important area is Jenkins security. Automation tools like Jenkins are a key part of the software delivery process in organizations, and their security is essential for the security of products.\nMisconfigured or outdated systems are a common attack vector, but there are also areas for improvement on the project’s side.\nBe sure there will be security advisories and vulnerability fixes in 2021.\nWe plan to keep adopting best security development and software delivery practices, and to improve dependency management and developer tools in the project. These areas will be in the spotlight for the project next year.\n\nEvents. Next month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a virtual Jenkins stand there.\nThere will also be a CI/CD devroom.\nIf you are interested to meet Jenkins contributors, it is a great opportunity. We also plan to continue all outreach programs and on onboarding more contributors.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement).\nWe are also ready to consider other non-coding project ideas as a part of CommunityBridge.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nJoin us in 2021!\n\nWe are always looking for more contributors, regardless of the profile and experience.\nJenkins is a vast ecosystem which includes many modern technologies.\n\nWe invite Jenkins users and contributors to participate in the community and to move these initiatives forward!\nJoin us in the mailing lists and special interest groups,","title":"2020 A Year Like No Other","tags":["community","new-year-blogpost","governance"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/914ee/markyjackson-taulia.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/1c9ce/markyjackson-taulia.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/bf8e1/markyjackson-taulia.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/acb7c/markyjackson-taulia.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/ef6ff/markyjackson-taulia.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/8257c/markyjackson-taulia.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/6766a/markyjackson-taulia.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/22bfc/markyjackson-taulia.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/2513553514518e745b05cc49f8778553/markyjackson-taulia.png"},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

the GSoC organization stipend from Google and other donations,\nthe Jenkins project usually provides travel grants to successful students so that they can visit a major community event, meet their mentors and community members in person, and present their work there.\nHere are some notes about the GSoC 2019 travel.\nUnfortunately this year it was not possible, and GSoC went completely virtual this year.\n\nOnline meetups\n\nIn August we organized Jenkins Online Meetups where students have presented their projects\n( part 1, part 2).\nYou can find recordings of these presentations in this playlist on the Jenkins YouTube channel.\n\nDevOps World\n\nThis year CloudBees, one of the Jenkins corporate sponsors, invited all students to participate in the DevOps World virtual conference on September 23-25.\nGSoC students did lighting talks about their projects, attended other conference talks, and joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation booth which represented the project at the conference.\nYou can find recordings of the talks and all materials here.\nAlthough the conference was in September, the talks were pre-recorded in early August.\nPlease refer to the Jenkins online meetup recordings for the recent versions.\n\nGSoC Mentor summit\n\nThis is a regular gathering for Google Summer of Code mentors and org admins where they share their experiences about GSoC, outreach programs, community management, and tools.\nUsually it is organized as a multi-day unconference after the end of GSoC, with 2-3 representatives from each project.\nIt has been a great learning experience to participate in it.\nThis year it was a single-day virtual event, and all mentors were able to attend.\nShivay Lamba, one of the GSoC 2020 mentors, also did a lightning talk about the GSoC projects he was working on in Jenkins and CNCF ( slides).\n\nSwag\n\nAll Google Summer of Code students and mentors get swag from Google.\nThis year, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) has sponsored swag for 50 most active GSoC participants:\nall students, mentors, and many other contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.\nThis is the third year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag,\nIn the previous years the swag logistics was one of the most challenging tasks for org admins during the entire project.\nand we highly appreciate help from CDF with this part.\nAs DevOps World presenters, the students have also received special edition speaker swag from CloudBees.\n\nThanks a lot to Google, Contrinuos Delivery Foundation (CDF) and CloudBees!\n\nRetrospective\n\nAfter completion of the coding phases,\norg admins have reached out to all GSoC 2020 participants to gather their feedback and suggestions.\nWe also recommended that project teams hold their own retrospective meetings.\nSuch information is instrumental to continuously improving GSoC in the Jenkins community.\nWe thank all contributors who shared their feedback!\n\nThe organization-wide retrospective was organized as a survey and a series of retrospective meetings.\nYou can find aggregated results in this Google Doc.\nOverall, we received very positive feedback from students and mentors.\nThe GSoC framework in Jenkins has matured significantly during the previous years.\nThe effort we invested to create guidelines and recommendations for all parties helped a lot because all the expectations were known in advance.\nAs usual, there is much to improve, especially with regards to the community bonding phases and cross-project communications.\nWe are processing the feedback, and we will expand our documentation and the contributor onboarding plans next year.\n\nSome personal notes\n\nI have been involved in leading and coordinating Google Summer of Code in open source projects since 2016.\nThis year I visited the GSoC stand at FOSDEM and met a few organizers and former students.\nA few days after, I proposed participating in GSoC at the Jenkins contributor summit in Brussels,\nand several contributors supported this idea.\nWe spent several hours to create the first Jenkins GSoC page and brainstorm on project ideas.\nWe submitted our application and were accepted.\nThanks a lot to the Google team that gave us a chance!\n\nIt is great to work with the students and see how they explore the open source community and grow professionally as engineers.\nIt is also awesome to see how some of them stay in the project and keep contributing,\nincluding becoming plugin maintainers and GSoC mentors.\nBut, for me, Google Summer of Code is not just about mentoring.\nIt also helps a lot with the community bonding…​ for the existing community like Jenkins which has a lot of isolated sub-communities in plugins.\nMany maintainers work alone, and it can be quite lonely working to maintain a plugin without feedback, developer ideas, and user interactions.\nWhen plugin contributors become project mentors, they join the wider community effort and work in teams.\nIn many cases they start contributing to the organization-wide activities and goals,\nand it grows the \"backbone\" of the Jenkins community.\nLike other community-driven projects, we need such backbone to scale the community and onboard more contributors to the countless Jenkins components.\nSo far it works really well and GSoC excels among outreach programs in this regard.\n\nI would like to thank the Google Open Source team, students and all Jenkins community members for the great Google Summer of Code this year.\nWe also thank the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help to recognize contributors and allow organization administrators to focus on projects.\nLast but not least, I would like to thank the Jenkins org admin team:\nMartin d’Anjou,\nMarky Jackson, and\nKara de la Marck.\nThis was a crazy year for everyone. Regardless of that, the org admins stepped up and took responsibility for students and mentors involved in the project, with a serious time commitment.\nNot all work by the organizers is publicly visible (applications, project selection, resolving conflicts),\nbut this work is essential to the project’s success.\nThanks a lot to org admins and mentors who helped with the administrative tasks this year!\n\nWhat’s about GSoC 2021?\n\nYes, we plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021.\nThe application period for organizations will start in a few months,\nbut we have already started preparing for the next GSoC session.\nWe are looking for mentors, org admins and project ideas.\nPlease contact us if you are interested!\n\nCall for Mentors and Project Ideas\n\nGSoC 2021 project ideas\n\nHOWTO: Propose a project idea\n\nInformation for mentors : guidelines and expectations\n\nWe invite potential students to start exploring the project and the available project ideas.\nOriginal ideas are always welcome in the project, and starting early is a great opportunity to\nget introduced to the Jenkins community, collect more information about the problem areas,\nand to create a good proposal.\n\"Start early\" is the most popular recommendation from GSoC 2020 participants to future GSoC students,\nand we encourage you to follow this advice!","title":"Google Summer

Summer of Code (GSoC)\nis a program where students are paid a stipend by Google to work on a free open source project.\nStudents work on the project for three months (June to August).\nPrior to the coding phase, there is a month of community bonding, to welcome students to the Jenkins community and acquaint them with the projects processes for communication and collaboration.\nMentors are actively involved with students from March when students start to work on and submit their applications.\n(see the timeline)\n\nWe are looking for project ideas and mentors to participate in GSoC 2021.\nGSoC project ideas are coding projects that university or college students can accomplish in about three months.\nThe coding projects can be new features, plugins, test frameworks, infrastructure, etc.\nAnyone can submit a project idea, but of course we like it even better if you offer to mentor your project idea.\n\nWe accept new project ideas at any time,\nHowever, project ideas need to be finalised before February 19th, 2021 at 7pm UTC,\nwhich is the deadline for the Jenkins organization to apply to the GSoC program.\nPlease send us your project ideas before the beginning of February so they can get a proper review by the GSoC committee and by the community.\n\nHow to submit a project idea\n\nCreate a pull-request with your idea in a.adoc file\nin the project ideas.\nIt is not necessary to submit a Google Doc, but it will still work if you want to do that.\nSee the instructions on submitting ideas which include an.adoc template and some examples.\n\nCurrent list of ideas\n\nWe currently have a list of project ideas for students to browse.\nNote that this list is subject to change.\n\nWhat does mentoring involve?\n\nPotential mentors are invited to read the information for mentors.\nNote that being a GSoC mentor does not require expert knowledge of Jenkins.\nMentors do not work alone. We make sure that every project has at least two mentors.\nGSoC org admins will help to find technical advisers, so you can study together with your students.\n\nMentoring takes about 5 to 8 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).\nMentors provide guidance, coaching, and sometimes a bit of cheerleading.\nThey review student proposals, pull-requests and the students presentations\nat the evaluation phase.\nThey fill in the Google provided evaluation report form at the end of coding periods.\n\nWhat do you get in exchange?\n\nIn return of mentoring, a student works on your project full time for three months.\nThink about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but never had the time…​\n\nMentoring is also an opportunity to improve your management and people skills, while giving back to the community.\n\nThere will be a Google Mentor Summit which takes place every year.\nIn 2020, the Mentor Summit was virtual, but in previous years the summit has taken place in person.\n\nSee this post\nabout the 2019 in person Mentor Summit.\n\nGSoC is a fantastic program and the Jenkins project is happy to participate in GSoC again in 2021!\n\nFor any question, you can find the GSoC Org Admins,\nmentors and participants on the GSoC SIG Gitter chat.","title":"Google Summer of Code 2021 call for Project Ideas and

Jenkins community has recently completed the 2020 elections.\nOn behalf of the Jenkins community and the elections committee,\nwe congratulate all newly elected board members and officers!\nWe also thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.\n\nElection results:\n\nGavin Mogan and Marky Jackson will join\nKohsuke Kawaguchi, Ullrich Hafner and Oleg Nenashev\non the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nTim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer\n\nMarky Jackson will become the new Events Officer (uncontested)\n\nOlivier Vernin will continue in the role of Infrastructure Officer for another term (uncontested)\n\nDaniel Beck will continue in the role of Security Officer for another term (uncontested)\n\nMark Waite will continue in the role of Documentation Officer for another term (uncontested)\n\nThe board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being,\nand we are excited to see contributors taking these roles.\nIf you are interested to learn more, please see the blog post below.\n\nGovernance Board election details\n\nThis year we had nine candidates participating in Jenkins Governance Board elections:\nAndrey Falko, Ewelina Wilkosz, Frederic Gurr, Gavin Mogan, Justin Harringa,\nMark Waite, Marky Jackson, Steven Terrana, and Zhao Xiaojie (Rick).\nAll of them are awesome community leaders who actively contribute to the Jenkins project and\nrepresent its users.\nIt would be an honor to have them on the Jenkins board.\nRegardless of the election results, we appreciate their participation and the time they invested in these elections.\n\nThis year we were electing 2 governance board members.\nWe were using the Condorcet Internet Voting Service that allows voters to rank their choices rather than just picking their one favorite choice.\nYou can find full voting results here :\n\nMark Waite  (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nMarky Jackson loses to Mark Waite by 48–12\n\nGavin Mogan loses to Mark Waite by 51–10, loses to Marky Jackson by 31–20\n\nEwelina Wilkosz  loses to Mark Waite by 48–14, loses to Gavin Mogan by 29–28\n\nJustin Harringa  loses to Mark Waite by 51–11, loses to Ewelina Wilkosz by 35–16\n\nSteven Terrana  loses to Mark Waite by 47–16, loses to Justin Harringa by 20–19\n\nZhao Xiaojie (Rick)  loses to Mark Waite by 57–5, loses to Steven Terrana by 25–24\n\nFrederic Gurr  loses to Mark Waite by 52–10, loses to Zhao Xiaojie (Rick) by 25–24\n\nAndrey Falko  loses to Mark Waite by 56–6, loses to Frederic Gurr by 26–13\n\nAlthough Mark Waite came first in the voting results,\nbeing on the board would violate the Corporate Involvement clause which states that\n\"the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%\".\nMark will continue to be Documentation officer.\nRegardless of his official role, Mark has been leading many initiatives and helping a lot with various aspects of the community governance.\n\nCongratulations to Marky and Gavin, and thanks to all candidates!\nAll new board members are elected for a 2-year term unless they decide to step down earlier.\nThe estimated end of the term for them is December 02, 2022.\nWe would also like to thank Alex Earl and R. Tyler Croy who step down from the Jenkins Governance Board this year.\nThanks to them for all contributions and for continued community leadership.\n\nStatement from Marky Jackson:\n\nIt is a tremendous honor to be elected to this roles. I am so humbled.\nBeing part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.\nMy goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.\nI look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.\n\n— Marky Jackson, Jenkins Governance Board Member and Events Officer\n\nStatement from Gavin Mogan:\n\nGavin here. I’m still in shock that I got voted in for the Jenkins board.\nIt felt like yesterday I just got started helping people randomly on IRC. This is truly exciting.\nI plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.\nThis is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.\nMy specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.\n\n— Gavin Mogan, Jenkins Governance Board Member\n\nOfficer election details\n\nAll 5 officer positions were up for election this year.\nThese roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2021.\nAfter the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,\n4 officer positions were uncontested:\n\nOlivier Vernin - Infrastructure officer.\n\nMarky Jackson - Events officer.\nMarky inherits this role from Alyssa Tong\nwho decided to step down from the officer role and to focus on the Jenkins community marketing,\nincluding Jenkins Is The Way and many other initiatives started by Alyssa.\n\nMark Waite - Documentation officer.\n\nDaniel Beck - Security officer.\n\nThanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!\nOfficers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.\nIt requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.\n\nRelease Officer election results\n\nTim Jacomb won the biggest support as a Release officer ( voting results).\nTim will replace in this role Oliver Gondža\nwho has been leading the Release Team and the release processes since 2016 when the role was officially introduced.\n\nTim Jacomb (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)\n\nBaptiste Mathus  loses to Tim Jacomb by 40–23\n\nVictor Martinez  loses to Tim Jacomb by 38–25, loses to Baptiste Mathus by 32–31\n\nHere is a statement from Tim Jacomb:\n\nI’m excited for the year ahead, let’s see where we can take the Jenkins release area in the future.\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation, ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team,\nand ensure that responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.\n\n— Tim Jacomb, Jenkins Release Officer\n\nThanks to Alyssa Tong and Oliver Gondža for their long-time service as Jenkins officers!\nWe are looking to continue working with them in the Jenkins community.\nAnd congratulations to Tim Jacomb and Marky Jackson for joining the team!\n\nStatistics\n\nThis year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.\nIt is significantly lower than in the 2019 elections when we had almost 350 voters.\nIt can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.\nThis year we decided to not use the previous voter registration system,\nand we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.\nThis is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.\n\nWhat’s next for the board?\n\nThe last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.\nWith help of many contributors and with the renewed board,\nwe have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,\nfor example hosting contributor summits,\npublishing the public roadmap,\nCode of Conduct update,\nterminology changes,\nand graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation.\nThere is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.\n\nIn short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.\nThe board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes\n(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.\n\nThere are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:\nlong-anticipated features and architecture changes,\nchanging the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process,\ncreating better communication channels with Jenkins users,\nand onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.\nSuch initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.\nThe ideas will be discussed in mailing lists and during governance meetings.\nIf you would like to share your vision and ideas about what’s needed in the project,\nit is definitely a great time to contribute!\n\nFeedback\n\nJenkins project plans to conduct elections every year.\nWe will appreciate and welcome any feedback regarding the election process so that we can improve the process.\nWe have started a Retrospective document for these elections.\nEveryone can suggest changes in this document, and we will integrate them.\nThere will be also a public retrospective review at the next Advocacy and Outreach SIG meeting on Dec 17.\n\nIf you have any private feedback you would like to share,\nplease send an email to the Jenkins Board.\nIf you would like to raise any issues about the election process,\nplease contact one of the elected Governance Board members.\n\nReferences\n\nJenkins Governance Board\n\nJenkins Board Election Process\n\nJenkins Officers\n\n2020 election
