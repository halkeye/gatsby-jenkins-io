As a member of the governance board,\nI’ll bring a fresh perspective by asking questions, providing feedback,\nand finding opportunities for others to contribute.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nLinkedIn\n\nAffiliations: Stripe\n\nEwelina Wilkosz\n\nAs a consultant I support my customers with their Jenkins issues since the beginning of 2017.\nAnd almost from the start it was some kind of \"as code\" approach.\nThe experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.\nI consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.\nI appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is.\n\nI am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience\nwith Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.\nEvery day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.\nAs a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users.\n\nThanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development\nI had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations\nwhere I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.\nHere are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:\nblogpost,\ncdCON presentation,\npodcast recording.\nSo my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,\nso I actually know what they need and why.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nLinkedIn,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: Eficode (former Praqma)\n\nFrederic Gurr\n\nI started to use Jenkins back in 2008, when it still had a different name.\nIn 2011 I started to contribute and created my first little plugin called\nextra-columns.\nSince then, using and administering Jenkins servers has become a major part of my work life,\nwhile getting involved with the Jenkins community\nkickstarted my interest and involvement with open source software and communities.\n\nI’ve been working as a release engineer at the Eclipse Foundation since 2016,\nsupporting 250+ Jenkins instances for various open source projects.\nI’d be honored to bring a user and admin oriented perspective to the Governance Board and help\nshape the future of Jenkins.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: Eclipse Foundation\n\nGavin Mogan\n\nI got started with Jenkins early on when I was just getting started with testing.\nI knew there had to be a way to run the tests automatically and report on them back to people.\nI started hacking my own tools before I came across Jenkins (then Hudson) and was hooked ever since.\nOver the years I’ve managed to install and configure Jenkins at various jobs,\nand even was employed making internal and external plugins and integrations.\nYou’ll often find me on the Jenkins IRC and Gitter channels as well as the subreddit giving a hand to people who are stuck.\nI also try to get involved with Jenkins Infrastructure projects as much as I can.\nI currently maintain the plugin site, plugin site API, Jenkins Wiki exporter, and a bunch of other minor projects.\nI also help run Vancouver’s chapter of Nodeschool.\n\nIf elected, I would like to address improving commercial support avenues.\nRight now it’s a lot of people flailing in isolation.\nI would like to not only improve things so people can find easier ways to get help,\nbut also encourage more users to help others, and push for a\ncentralized source of companies providing commercial support.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: Digital Ocean, Nodeschool Vancouver\n\nJustin Harringa\n\nThe nomination is quite an honor for me.\nI have been a Hudson/Jenkins user since around 2009/2010 when\nI started working through driving continuous integration in a corporate environment at John Deere.\nAs time went on, I began contributing some small fixes to plugins such as the Job DSL Plugin, OpenID Plugin, and the Workflow Job Plugin.\nEventually, I ended up helping maintain Salesforce’s Chatter plugin and then open sourcing plugins such as the Config-Driven Pipeline Plugin with Andrey Falko.\nMore recently, I have also had the extreme pleasure of mentoring in 2 Jenkins projects for Google Summer of Code\n(Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab in 2019 and Git Plugin Performance Improvements in 2020).\n\nI have learned so much from working with Jenkins and I would love to give back to the project further.\nHaving introduced Jenkins at both small and large companies,\nI would love to help contribute to the direction of the project through the Roadmap/SIGs/JEPs and encourage others to also contribute / improve Jenkins.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nLinkedIn\n\nAffiliations: Salesforce, Spinnaker SIG for Azure\n\nMark Waite\n\nI’m a Jenkins contributor, a member of the Jenkins core team,\none of the leaders of the Platform Special Interest Group,\nand leader of the Documentation Special Interest Group.\nI’ve served as the Jenkins Documentation Officer since 2019.\nI was a mentor for Google Season of Code 2020 and am one of the maintainers of the Git plugin for Jenkins.\n\nIf elected and allowed to serve on the Jenkins Board, I’ll work to increase community involvement and community development.\nI’m deeply interested in tooling and environments that support the Jenkins project,\nincluding the Jenkins CI environments, issue tracker, artifact repository, and source code repositories.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nLinkedIn,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nMarky Jackson\n\nI have been involved in the Jenkins project for many years.\nI started out as a plugin maintainer, SIG member and general helper.\nI moved to a SIG lead, speakers and Google Summer of Code and Docs org admin and mentor.\nMy current goals are to help continue the work of the public roadmap as well and gain most community members by continuing to be a champion of the community.\n\nFor me, being on the Jenkins Board is another opportunity to improve upon the great work\nwe have all done as well as work toward branching out our efforts to have more women, people of color and LGBTQIA members.\nI would be honored to have this opportunity.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nLinkedIn,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: Equinix Metal, Continuous Delivery Foundation, Kubernetes, Ortelius\n\nSteven Terrana\n\nI have been a Jenkins user since 2017 and contributor since 2018.\nI am the primary maintainer of the Jenkins Templating Engine,\na plugin that allows users to create truly templated Jenkins pipelines that can be shared across teams.\nThrough that work, I’ve had the great pleasure of helping to organize the Pipeline Authoring Special Interest Group,\ncontributing to the Jenkins Pipeline documentation, and contributing bug fixes to various plugins\n(including the pipeline plugin and workflow-cps library).\n\nAs a Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador,\nI’ve enjoyed doing what I can to advance the community’s approach to CI/CD and simplifying DevSecOps adoption within large organizations.\nIt would be a privilege to serve on the Jenkins Governance Board and offer my support wherever I can.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nLinkedIn\n\nAffiliations: Booz Allen Hamilton, Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nZhao Xiaojie (Rick)\n\nThree years ago I joined the Jenkins community.\nI learned a lot during the process of contributing.\nI even became a Jenkins hero in my city.\nThe most exciting thing I want to do is help more new users of Jenkins get started, and let more contributors feel comfortable.\nI always love to host a JAM no matter if it’s online or offline.\n\nPlans: improve the experience of using Jenkins in different\ncountries; reorganize the knowledge of Jenkins, for example the tutorial\nby text or video format; help other SIG leaders to organize meetings.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter\n\nAffiliations: N/A\n\nRelease Officer\n\nBaptiste Mathus\n\nI have been using and contributing to Jenkins for so long that it is difficult for me to check when it started exactly.\nMy first pull-request to Jenkins was in 2011 and I had started to use it long before it.\nThroughout the years, I have contributed to various areas:\ncreated our local Jenkins Area Meetup with Michaël Pailloncy,\nhelped users and developers on our mailing lists and IRC channels,\ncontributed to the Jenkins infrastructure, the website,\nprocessing plugins hosting requests, worked full time on Jenkins Evergreen,\nand I am still present today.\n\nFor all these reasons, it would be an honor to serve as the Release Officer for the Jenkins Project.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nTim Jacomb\n\nI have been a user of Jenkins for the last 8 years and a regular contributor since 2018.\nI began with maintaining the Slack plugin and over the last couple of years I have since expanded that to many more plugins and the Jenkins core.\nThese are some of the components I maintain when I have time: Slack, Azure Key Vault, Junit,\nmost of the Database plugins, Dark theme, Plugin installation manager, Jenkins Helm chart, Configuration as code plugin.\nI am also a member of the Jenkins infrastructure team,\nand I was involved in the release automation project and the mirrors modernisation effort,\nalong with the day to day support helping people regain access to accounts etc.\n\nAs a Release Officer I would like to increase automation,\nease onboarding of new contributors to the release team, and ensure that\nresponsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: Kainos\n\nVictor Martinez\n\nI have been involved in the Jenkins project since 2011 by different means, as a user, as an administrator, as a contributor\n(bug reporting, plugin development, documentation, hackfest),\nbeing active in the different Jenkins forums such as the Jenkins-dev and Jenkins-user mailing lists,\nworking with the jenkins-infra shared library and so on.\nI’m also an advocate for the Jenkins project through some presentations anytime that I had the opportunity such as\nDevOps World 2020 and\nJenkins World 2017.\n\nI’ve been happily nominated for the Release officer role which matches not just my area of professional expertise that\nI’ve been doing for the last 14 years in different roles for different companies but also that’s an area of personal interest\nwhere I’d like to spend time with the Jenkins community to understand, document and automate the process\nin a way we can keep the project sustainable for a long term as it’s today,\nit’s not just about what I can bring for the community but also about growing together.\n\nIf elected as a Release officer I would aim to focus on the following areas:\nproceed with the existing responsibilities for this role;\ndocument and automate the release process;\nbeing an enabler for the Continuous Delivery not just for the plugins but also for the core.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nLinkedIn\n\nAffiliations: Elastic\n\nSecurity Officer - uncontested\n\nDaniel Beck\n\nI’ve been a Jenkins user since 2011, contributor since 2013, and core maintainer since 2014.\nIn 2015, I took on the scheduling and authoring of security advisories and have been doing that ever since,\nworking with reporters, maintainers, and the Jenkins security team to deliver security fixes.\nBeyond that, I regularly contribute to Jenkins and project infrastructure.\n\nSince I’ve started in the Security Officer role, we’ve made significant\nimprovements:\nPlugins no longer allow ordinary users to run arbitrary scripts (no sandbox!) as a regular feature. I introduced fine-grained permission management\nfor our GitHub repositories and\nthe Maven repository hosting our releases.\nWarnings directly in Jenkins inform admins when an installed component has known security issues (and their UX was improved earlier this year).\nThe Jenkins project is now a CVE Numbers Authority,\nto ensure timely and high-quality information in the CVE vulnerability database.\nWorking with Tyler, I added telemetry to Jenkins,\nwhich allowed us to deliver multiple large-scale security fixes with\nminimal impact.\nMore recently, I’ve started writing code scanning rules for common problems in Jenkins and\ninvited maintainers to sign their plugins up,\nwhich is something I hope to properly publish and roll out more widely soon.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nEvents Officer - uncontested\n\nMarky Jackson\n\nI have been a part of the Jenkins community for some time, and I have received the utmost joy in volunteering.\nI have been extremely fortunate to have played a lead role in the Outreach & Advocacy SIG, the pipeline-Authoring SIG,\nand, most recently, the Cloud-Native SIG.\nI have taken part in many meetups, org admin, and mentor in the GSoC & GSoD.\nFinally, At DevOps World 2020, I received Jenkins most valuable advocate at DevOps World.\nI have experience advocating in other communities as well:\nKubernetes Release Manager Associate, Kubernetes Mentoring Lead, Ortelius Community Manager.\n\nJenkins is the most widely used Continuous Integration tool around,\nand I want to continue to promote that by focusing on the following areas: meetups; conference presentation from the Jenkins community;\nnew user outreach and onboarding; cross-community collaboration (e.g., Kubernetes community);\nworking with the Continuous Delivery Foundation on interoperability; focusing on SIG events.\n\nMy roots are open-source, and I am so proud to be a part of the Jenkins community.\nYou can read more about my journey in open-source here.\nYou can also see some of my presentations here and\nhere.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nLinkedIn,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: OpsMx, Continuous Delivery Foundation, Kubernetes, Ortelius, Spinnaker\n\nInfrastructure Officer - uncontested\n\nOlivier Vernin\n\nI have been actively contributing to the Jenkins project for the past four years with contributions across many areas,\nand infrastructure is one of my favorite topics.\nOver my previous mandate as a Jenkins infrastructure officer, I focused on improving contribution experience,\nand let community members opportunities to take ownership of the different services.\nI worked on various sponsoring initiatives to make the Jenkins infrastructure more sustainable.\nWe provided a new environment for releasing Jenkins core (and one plugin!), and also many more things.\n\nFor the coming year, It is hard to make commitments on what it will look like as we have things we know,\nlike services that need some attention (“ci.jenkins.io/) and the things we don’t know yet.\nAnyway, It’s important to me to have a transparent project where everybody could read, learn, participate,\nand understand how the Jenkins project manages infrastructure and I want to continue down that path.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nDocumentation Officer - uncontested\n\nMark Waite\n\nI’m a Jenkins contributor, a member of the Jenkins core team, one of the leaders of the Platform Special Interest Group,\nand leader of the Documentation Special Interest Group.\nI’ve served as the Jenkins Documentation Officer since 2019.\nI was a mentor for Google Season of Code 2020 and am one of the maintainers of the Git plugin for Jenkins.\n\nIf elected and allowed to serve as Documentation Officer,\nI’ll continue efforts to invite more contributors through regular Documentation Office Hours and outreach programs like Google Season of Docs, CommunityBridge, Outreachy, and Jenkins Hackfests.\nI’ll work to assure an inviting and welcoming environment for contributors.\n\nProfile links:\nGitHub,\nTwitter,\nLinkedIn,\nJenkins Blog\n\nAffiliations: CloudBees\n\nMore information\n\nJenkins 2020 elections announcement\n\nJenkins Governance Board and Jenkins Officers\n\nJenkins Board and Officer Election Process\n\n2019 election results\n\nElections coordination in the mailing list","title":"2020 Elections: Governance Board and Officer candidates","tags":["community","governance","governance-board","elections"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ce6df408-6cd5-5276-88d1-f05a7d26b213","slug":"/blog/2020/09/24/board-elections/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins 2020 Elections are over, thanks to all participants!\nPlease see the results announcement.\n\nWe are happy to announce the 2020 elections in the Jenkins project!\nNominations are open for two governance board and for all five officer positions,\nnamely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation.\nThe board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being.\nWe invite Jenkins contributors and community members to sign-up for elections and to nominate contributors for the elected roles.\nDeadline for nominations is Oct 15, voter registration ends on Nov 02.\n\nThese are the second elections held by the Jenkins project.\nDuring the 2019 elections, we elected 3 board members and 5 officers.\nYou can find the voting results here.\nThis year, we decided to make a few changes in the election process based on the 2019 elections feedback.\n\nKey dates\n\nSep 24 - Nominations open, voting sign-up begins.\n\nOct 15 - Board and officer nominations deadline.\n\nOct 26 (or later) - List of candidates is published, including personal statements.\n\nNov 10 - Voting begins.

are happy to announce that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in\nthe Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).\nThis status is officially effective Aug 03, 2020.\nJenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.\nThanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!\n\nIn this article, we will discuss what the CD Foundation membership and graduation mean to the Jenkins community.\nWe will also talk about what changed in Jenkins as a part of the graduation,\nand what are the future steps for the project.\n\nTo know more about the Jenkins graduation,\nsee also the announcement on the CD Foundation website.\nAlso see the special edition of the CD Foundation Newsletter for Jenkins user success stories and some surprise content.\nThe press release is available here.\n\nHow does CDF membership help us?\n\nAbout 18 months ago, Jenkins became one of the CDF founding projects, along with Jenkins X, Spinnaker and Tekton.\nA new foundation was formed to provide a vendor-neutral home for open source projects used for Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration.\nSpecial interest groups were started to foster collaboration between projects and end user companies,\nmost notably:\nInteroperability,\nMLOps and\nSecurity SIGs.\nAlso, a Community Ambassador role was created to organize local meetups and to provide public-facing community representatives.\nMany former Jenkins Ambassadors and other contributors are now CDF Ambassadors, and they promote Jenkins and other projects there.\n\nThanks to this membership we addressed key project infrastructure needs.\nStarting from Jan 2020, CDF covers a significant part of the infrastructure costs\nincluding our services and CI/CD instances running on Microsoft Azure.\nThe CD Foundation provided us with legal assistance required to get code signing keys for the Jenkins project.\nThanks to that, we were able to switch to a new Jenkins Release Infrastructure.\nThe foundation sponsors the Zoom account we use for Jenkins Online Meetups and community meetings.\nIn the future we will continue to review ways of reducing maintenance overhead by switching some of our self-hosted services to equivalents provided by the Linux Foundation to CDF members.\n\nAnother important CDF membership benefit is community outreach and marketing.\nIt helped us to establish connections with other CI/CD projects and end user companies.\nThrough the foundation we have access to the DevStats service\nthat provides community contribution statistics and helps us track trends and discover areas for improvement.\nOn the marketing side, the foundation organizes webinars, podcasts and newsletters.\nJenkins is regularly represented there.\nThe CD Foundation also runs the meetup.com professional account which is used by local Jenkins communities for\nCI/CD and Jenkins Area Meetups.\nLast but not least, the Jenkins community is also represented at virtual conferences where CDF has a booth.\nAll of that helps to grow Jenkins visibility and to highlight new features and initiatives in the project.\n\nWhy did we graduate?\n\nThe Jenkins project has a long history of open governance which is a key part of today’s project success.\nStarting from 2011, the project has introduced the governance meeting which are open to anyone.\nMost of the discussions and decision making happen publicly in the mailing lists.\nIn 2015 we introduced teams, sub-projects and officer roles.\nIn 2017 we introduced the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process which helped us to make the key architecture and governance decisions more open and transparent to the community and the Jenkins users.\nIn 2018 we introduced special interest groups that focus on community needs.\nIn 2019 we have expanded the Jenkins governance board\nso that it got more bandwidth to facilitate initiatives in the project.\n\nSince the Jenkins project inception 15 years ago, it has been steadily growing.\nNow it has millions of users and thousands of contributors.\nIn 2019 it has seen 5,433 contributors from 111 countries and 272 companies,\n67 core and 2,654 plugin releases,\n45,484 commits, 7,000+ pull requests.\nIn 2020 Q2 the project has seen 21% growth in pull requests numbers compared to 2019 Q2, bots excluded.\n\nOne may say that the Jenkins project already has everything needed to succeed.\nIt is a result of continuous work by many community members,\nand this work will never end as long as the project remains active.\nLike in any other industry, the CI/CD ecosystem changes every day and sets new expectations from the automation tools in this domain.\nJust as the tools evolve, open source communities need to evolve so that they can address expectations, and onboard more users and contributors.\nThe CDF graduation process helped us to discover opportunities for improvement,\nand address them.\nWe reviewed the project processes and compared them with the Graduated Project criteria defined in the CDF project lifecycle.\nBased on this review, we made changes in our processes and documentation.\nIt should improve the experience of Jenkins users,\nand help to make the Jenkins community more welcoming to existing and newcomer contributors.\n\nWhat changed for the project?\n\nBelow you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:\n\nPublic roadmap\n\nWe introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.\nThis roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.\nIt makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters,\nand at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.\nThe roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in jep:14[].\n\nMore details about the public roadmap are coming next week, stay tuned for a separate blogpost.\nOn July 10th we had an online contributor meetup about the roadmap\nand you can find more information in its materials\n( slides, video recording).\n\nUser Documentation\n\nJenkins Weekly Release line is now documented on our website ( here).\nWe have also reworked the downloads page and added guidelines explaining how to verify downloads.\n\nA new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.\nThis list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,\nincluding ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.\nPlease do not hesitate to add your company there!\n\nCommunity\n\nWe passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.\nThis certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices\nand to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).\nIt also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.\nDetails are on the Jenkins core page.\n\nJenkins Code of Conduct was updated\nto the new version of Contributor Covenant.\nIn particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.\n\nThe default Jenkins contributing template was updated to cover more common cases for plugin contributors.\nThis page provides links to the Participate and Contribute guidelines hosted on our website,\nand helps potential contributors to easily access the documentation.\n\nThe Jenkins Core maintainer guide was updated to include maintenance and issues triage guidelines.\nIt should help us to deliver quality releases and to timely triage and address issues reported by Jenkins users.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIt an honor to be the first project to reach the graduated stage in the Continuous Delivery Foundation,\nbut it is also a great responsibility for the project.\nAs a project, we plan to continue participating in the CDF activities and to work with other projects and end users to maintain the Jenkins' leader role in the CI/CD space.\n\nWe encourage everyone to join the project and participate in evolving the Jenkins project and driving its roadmap.\nIt does not necessarily mean committing code or documentation patches;\nuser feedback is also very important to the project.\nIf you are interested to contribute or to share your feedback,\nplease contact us in the Jenkins community channels ( mailing lists, chats)!\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nCDF graduation work was a major effort in the Jenkins community.\nCongratulations and thanks to the dozens of contributors who made our graduation possible.\nI would like to thank\nAlex Earl,\nAlyssa Tong,\nDan Lorenc,\nDaniel Beck,\nJeff Thompson,\nMarky Jackson,\nMark Waite,\nOlivier

this article, I would like to share some highlights from the User Interface track of the\nJenkins UI/UX Hackfest we held on May 25..29.\nThis blog post has been slightly delayed by the infrastructure issues we had in the project,\nbut, as for improving the Jenkins UI, it is better late than never.\nKey highlights from the event:\n\nWe delivered a preview of Jenkins read-only configuration.\nDuring the hackfest we discovered and fixed many compatibility issues.\n\nWe created a new Dark Theme for Jenkins.\nWe also improved theming support in the core, and fixed compatibility in many plugins.\n\nWe contributed to the Jenkins UI accessibility, including UX testing and fixing the reported issues.\njira:JENKINS-62437[Configuration UI: Tables to divs migration] testing was the dominant story there.\n\nWe worked on a New Script Security approvals management UI\n\nWe had 54 contributors at the hackfest.\n22 of them have contributed to the user interface track as committers, testers and reviewers:\nTim Jacomb,\nUllrich Hafner,\nRaihaan Shouhell,\nSumit Sarin,\nDaniel Beck,\nRomén Rodríguez-Gil,\nwadeck Follonier,\nRunxia Ye,\nFélix Queiruga,\nAytunc Beken,\nPeter Jonsson,\nAntonio Muniz,\nKseniia Nenasheva,\nSladyn Nuner,\nAbhyudaya Sharma,\nOleg Nenashev,\nNimish Bongale,\nEsther Álvarez Feijoo,\nDenys Digtiar,\nSlavo,\nLiam Newman, and\nGavin Mogan.\nThanks to all contributors!\n\nSee the blog post below to know more about these and other user interface improvements.\n\nRead-only Jenkins Configuration\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nfeature preview announcement,\npresentation materials\n\nA read-only view of Jenkins configurations, jobs and agents is important to Jenkins Configuration-as-Code users.\nIt would allow them to access configuration and diagnostics information about their Jenkins instances while having no opportunity to occasionally change it.\nThis story is a part of the Jenkins roadmap,\nand it was featured as an area for contribution during the UI/UX hackfest.\n\nOn May 25th we have released a preview for Read-only Jenkins Configuration.\nRead the announcement by Tim Jacomb in this blogpost.\nDuring the hackfest we kept testing the change and fixing compatibility in the Jenkins plugins,\nincluding the Cloud Stats Plugin, Role Strategy Plugin, Simple Disk Usage Plugin and others.\n\nWe would appreciate feedback and testing from the Jenkins users!\nSee the blogpost for the guidelines.\n\nDark Theme\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nproject repository\n\nDark user interface themes are very popular among developers: in IDE, communication tools, etc.\nAnd there is an interest to have one for Jenkins.\nThere were a few of implementations before the hackfest, most notably camalot/jenkins-dark-stylish and a dark version of the Neo2 Theme.\nThese themes were difficult to maintain, and finally they were either removed or abandoned.\nWhat if Jenkins had an official theme?\n\nDuring the event a group of contributors focused on creating a new Dark Theme for Jenkins.\nThis effort included:\n\nPatches to the Jenkins core which simplified development and maintenance of UI themes.\nSupport for CSS variables was added, as well as PostCSS processing which helps to simplify browser compatibility.\n\nDark Theme itself.\n\nUI Testing and compatibility fixes in the core and multiple Jenkins plugins.\n\nDark theme demo with support for the development mode.\n\nYou can try out this theme starting from Jenkins 2.239.\nIt is available as a plugin from the Jenkins Update Center.\nAn example screenshot of the main page:\n\nIf you discover any Dark theme compatibility issues,\nplease report them here.\n\nJenkins Configuration UI Accessibility\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\nproject page\n\nJenkins Web UI accessibility was one of the suggested topics at the event.\nWe would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.\nIt includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.\nIn general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.\nSome of the accessibility improvements we implemented during the event:\n\nAdded aria-labels to username & password input fields\n\nIndicate the language of the page in the footer (not merged yet)\n\nRemove page generation timestamp from the footer\n\nAt the UI/UX hackfest the major focus was on migrating configuration pages from tables to divs\n(jira:JENKINS-62437[]).\nIt will make them more user-friendly on narrow and especially mobile screens.\nThe change will also help users to navigate complex forms with multiple levels of nesting.\nOur progress:\n\nUser Experience testing.\nThanks to the contributors, we discovered several compatibility issues in plugins.\n\nBug fixes in several plugins\n\nA new Dockerized demo which allows to evaluate the change with a set of pre-configured plugins.\n\nHere is an example of a job configuration page using the new layout:\n\nWe will keep working on this change in the coming weeks,\nand we invite Jenkins users and Contributors to help us with testing the change!\nTesting guidelines are available in the jira:JENKINS-62437[] ticket.\n\nNew Script Security approvals management UI\n\nQuick access:\ndemo,\npull request\n\nDuring the hackfest Wadeck Follonier redesigned the script approval interface in the Script Security Plugin.\nThe new UI allows viewing the list of approved scripts, shows the last access timestamp, and allows managing the approvals individually.\nBefore, it was not possible to do it from the Web interface.\nOnce the pull request is released,\nthe feature will become available to Jenkins users.\n\nOther UI improvements\n\nIn addition to the major improvements listed above,\nthere were also many smaller patches in the Jenkins core and various plugins.\nYou can find a full list of contributions to the user interface here,\nsome important improvements:\n\nImproved navigation in the Credentials plugin.\n\nSupport for wide screens in the Autograding plugin.\n\nUI Improvements in the Folder-based Authorization Strategy plugin.\n\nImproved Fingerprint listing in the Jenkins core\n\nContributing\n\nWe invite Jenkins users and contributors to join the effort and to improve the user interface together.\nThe Jenkins project gradually adopts modern frontend stacks (JavaScript, React, Gatsby, Vue.js, etc.) and design methodologies.\nFor example, see the presentation about beautifying the UI of Jenkins reporter plugins by Ullrich Hafner.\nIt is a great opportunity for frontend developers to join the project, share their experiences, experiment with new technologies, and improve the Jenkins user interface and user experience.\nJoin us!\n\nSee this page for more information about contributing to the Jenkins codebase.\nIf you want to know more, join us in the Jenkins User Experience SIG channels.\n\nReferences\n\nYou can find more information

2016, the Jenkins community decided to start removing offensive terminology within the project.\nThe \"slave\" term was deprecated in Jenkins 2.0 and replaced by the \"agent\" term.\nOther terminology was slated for review after the cleanup of the \"slave\" term which was considered as most problematic one.\nIn 2017, the project began tracking areas for correction.\nWork has been done on renaming the SSH build agent plugin as well as gradual removal of offensive naming in services and repositories.\nThis year, a group of core contributors continued addressing this critical work.\n\nThe Advocacy & Outreach SIG met to discuss and prioritize the continued work. The governance board has also met and there will be more information coming regarding removal of offensive terminology.\nLast week we took another step towards removing offensive terminology within the project by updating previous blog posts and removing offensive terminology in old blogs, cleaning up some references in Jenkins built-in documetation and localization, etc.\nThe meeting minutes are available here and a recording of the meeting here\nThere is more work to do. The core team is working to address terms such as \"Master\", \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" as well addressing git branching terminology.\n\nWe could use your help\nWe continue to do this much needed work and would like to remind everyone that the Jenkins project is governed by the Code of Conduct.\n\nSincerely,\nMarky Jackson","title":"On Jenkins Terminology

Jenkins project relies heavily on its infrastructure.\nWe use websites like www.jenkins.io and plugins.jenkins.io, ticketing systems like issues.jenkins.io, CI/CD infrastructure like ci.jenkins.io, and many other services.\nJust to provide some context about the Jenkins infrastructure scale, here are some stats from April 2020:\n\nOver 600 000 people visited www.jenkins.io\n\nOver 250 000 Jenkins servers regularly checked the\nJenkins package server and the\nJenkins update server\n\nOver 43 000 continuous integration jobs ran on ci.jenkins.io\n\nOver 950 plugins ran their continuous integration pipelines on ci.jenkins.io\n\nCountry by country visitors to jenkins.io\n\nThe Jenkins project, as an open source project, is built and maintained by its awesome community.\nLike in any organization, there are specific people who make sure that those services are always up and running.\nEveryone is welcome to participate.\nInfrastructure is no exception, we are always looking for new contributors to the infrastructure!\n\nWhile we can’t share publicly everything like secrets and certificates,\nwe still try to be as transparent as possible so that everybody can understand and improve our infrastructure without having privileged access.\nWhat better way than using Git to manage infrastructure work?\n\nWho said GitOps?\n\nSince the creation of the Jenkins-infra organization on GitHub in March 2008, more than 650 people have contributed to over 80 git repositories.\nThose contributions make the Jenkins community what it is today.\nIf you can’t find something there, it probably means that some help is welcomed.\n\nMore recently, with help from Gavin Mogan, Tim Jacomb, and Alex Earl, big achievements have been possible on many fronts like automating Jenkins releases, refreshing plugins.jenkins.io, adding new agents to ci.jenkins.io, and maintaining our Kubernetes cluster.\nWe thank them for their help and for the infrastructure progress they have enabled.\n\nInfrastructure at Scale\n\nRunning infrastructure at the scale the Jenkins project does is expensive and sometimes quite challenging.\nWe are fortunate enough to be supported by many leading companies that provide us their expertise, their products, and their support.\n\nRecently, Amazon Web Services donated $60 000 to run Jenkins infrastructure on the AWS cloud.\nWe’re so grateful for their donation and for the flexibility it provides.\nWe’re running Linux agents with AMD64 and ARM64 architectures on AWS.\nWe’re using AWS cloud for our Windows agents.\nThe generous infrastructure donation from Amazon Web Services has increased our continuous integration capacity and broadened our platform coverage.\n\nOur Sponsors\n\nMajor sponsors of the Jenkins infrastructure include\nCloudBees,\nOregon State University Open Source Lab,\nContinuous Delivery Foundation,\nRed Hat,\nAmazon Web Services, and\nGitHub.\n\nAdditional sponsors of Jenkins infrastructure services and software include\nAtlassian,\nDatadog,\nFastly,\nIBM.\nJFrog,\nPagerduty,\nRackspace,\nSentry,\nServerion,\nSpinUp,\nTsinghua University, and\nXMission.\n\nEach of these organizations support the Jenkins project in their own way.\nWe thank them for their contributions, their support and for their willingness to help the Jenkins community.\n\nhttps://www.jenkins.io/projects/infrastructure/","title":"Jenkins Infrastructure: Stats, Updates, and AWS

is not glamorous, but it is goodness.\n\n— Thomas Otter\n\nJenkins technical documentation is an important part of our project as it is key to using Jenkins well.\nGood documentation guides users and encourages good implementation choices.\nIt is a crucial part of the user experience.\n\nIn the recent Jenkins UI/UX hackfest, documentation was a specific track to improve the Jenkins user experience.\nWe received many improvements from experienced Jenkins contributors and newcomers alike.\nContributors from all around the world submitted pull requests for documentation on installing, managing, administering, and operating Jenkins.\n\nDocumentation migration from Wiki\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki pages have collected 15 years of experience and wisdom for Jenkins users.\nHowever, that experience and wisdom is intermixed with inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated information.\n\nThe Jenkins Wiki migration project identified the 50 most accessed pages on the Jenkins wiki and created GitHub issues to track the migration of those pages to www.jenkins.io.\nThis was our first large scale experiment using GitHub issues for documentation.\nThe results have been overwhelmingly positive.\nHackfest contributors added new sections to many documentation chapters, including:\n\nUsing Jenkins\n\nPipeline\n\nManaging Jenkins\n\nSystem Administration\n\nThe Hackfest closed 19 of the wiki migration issues.\nWork is in progress on an additional 25 wiki migration issues.\nWe’ve made great progress and look forward to even better results in the future.\nNew contributors used the \"good first issue\" label very effectively.\nWe started the Hackfest with most of the 25 \"good first issues\" unassigned and completed the Hackfest with 14 closed and 10 others in progress.\nWe’ll provide more \"good first issues\" as we use the Jenkins Wiki migration to welcome new documentation contributors.\n\nMigrating plugin documentation\n\nPlugin documentation is also in transition.\nSince November 2019, plugins have been moving their documentation into the GitHub repository that hosts the plugin source code.\nThis\"documentation as code\" approach allows plugin maintainers to include documentation improvements in the same pull requests that implement new capabilities.\nIt assures that documentation changes are reviewed by the same maintainers who review and approve new capabilities.\n\nHackfest participants submitted pull requests to migrate plugin documentation to GitHub.\n10 plugin pull requests are in progress from the Hackfest.\n5 plugin pull requests from the Hackfest have been already merged and are awaiting the release of the plugin.\n\nChuck Norris uses documentation as code\n\nIn the spirit of fun and adventure, Oleg Nenashev migrated the \"Chuck Norris plugin\" to GitHub documentation as code in a live Hackfest presentation May 26, 2020.\nLinks to the recording, the plugin migration guide, and the export tool are available from\"Migrating plugins to documentation-as-code\".\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nJenkins works with other technologies to solve automation challenges in many different environments.\nWe describe those environments in our\"Solution Pages\".\nAs part of the Hackfest, we’ve started a series of improvements to the solution pages.\n\nThe Docker solutions page now includes updated videos and a better page layout for easier reading and better navigation.\nOther solution pages will receive similar improvements in the future.\n\nSystem properties\n\nThe global configuration of Jenkins can be modified at startup by defining Java properties.\nSystem properties can change system defaults and can provide compatibility \"escape hatches\" when a new default configuration might be incompatible with existing installations.\n\nDaniel Beck has improved the navigation and user experience of the system properties page as part of the Hackfest.\nIt is now much easier to read and to reference, with embeddable links available with a mouse-over to the right of every property and labels that categorize and classify each property.\n\nPlugin site improvements\n\nDuring the Hackfest, Gavin Mogan has continued his efforts to improve the Jenkins Plugins Site so that users can easily access plugin changelogs and reported issues.\nOnce this pull request is merged, it will greatly improve the experience of those Jenkins users who want to update plugins and look for documentation about what has changed in them and what are the possible issues they might experience.\n\nExample of the incoming UI for the Jira plugin:\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThere is still much to do in Jenkins documentation and we need your help to do it.\nThere are many ways to participate in the Jenkins project, including documentation.\nSee the contributing guidelines for detailed instructions.\nJoin the documentation chat for personalized help and encouragement.\n\nThe Jenkins project has been also accepted to Google Season of Docs this year.\nThis open-source mentorship program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nWe are looking for technical writers who are interested to contribute to the project in September-December 2020.\nIt is a great opportunity to study Documentation-as-code tools and to learn more about contributing to open-source projects.\nYou can find Jenkins project ideas and more information here.","title":"Jenkins User Experience Hackfest Documentation
