So I decided to analyze one year of data\nfrom January 2017 to January 2018. Then I selected\nstatcounter\nas an external data source in order to compare results from jenkins.io.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about numbers:\n\nDuring that period, 3,496,245 users across the world visited this website.\n\nThis is a growth of 52.69% visitors compared to the year before.\n\n92.28% of them used a desktop, 6.63% were on mobile and only 1.10% on a tablet.\n\nTable 1. Browser Usage\n\nBrowser\nPercentage\n\nChrome\n69.82%\n\nFirefox\n14.75%\n\nSafari\n6.44%\n\nIE\n5.84%\n\nEdge\n1.59%\n\nWe clearly see that 91% of Jenkins.io visitors only use three browsers. Chrome\nis by far the leader followed by Firefox and Safari.\n\nObviously those numbers taken alone don’t mean anything, so let’s try to put\nthem in perspective with another data source.\n\nNetscape 4.8 was still used by 15 visitors over the year.\n\n6 visitors used their Nintendo DS.\n\nStatCounter\n\nLet’s now compare our previous results with the same time period from\nstatcounter who argues to collect data from\n2million websites.  Statcounter allow us to display browsers stats based on 4\ndifferent categories, 'All platform', 'Desktop', 'Tablet' or 'Mobile'. + For\nthis comparison, I am interested by 'All platform' and of course 'Desktop' as\n92.28% of Jenkins.io visitors use a desktop.\n\nTable 2. Browser Market Share Across All Platforms\n\nBrowser\nPercentage\n\nChrome\n54.13%\n\nSafari\n14.50%\n\nUC Browser\n8.25%\n\nFirefox\n6.15%\n\nIE\n3.89%\n\nExcepted Chrome who still leads the ranking with \"only\" 54%, all the others\nactors are totally shuffled.  Safari moved to the 2nd place with 14.50% 'UC\nBrowser' appeared in the top 3 with 8.25% where only 0.10% of Jenkins.io\nvisitors were using UC browser.  Firefox moved to the 4th places with only\n6.15%.  It’s interesting how this \"All platform\" browser market share from\nstatcounter doesn’t reflect Jenkins.io visitors' habits.\n( Source )\n\nNow at a first glance, results look more similar to the Jenkins.io visitors;\nexcepted for Chrome and Firefox which shed some percentages in favor of\nInternet Explorer and Edge.  This promotes IE to the 3rd place with 8.86% of\nusage, and downgrade Safari to the 4th place with 6,44%.  Compared to\nJenkins.io results, Edge is still at the 5th position.  It’s very interesting\nto see how this ranking is so different from the \"All platform\" one but follows\nthe same pattern coming from Jenkins.io visitors.  This highlights how browser\nchoices are strongly influenced by the platform used and contrary to a general\ntrend,\nJenkins.io visitors remain desktop users.  This absence of mobile users\nprobably explains why some browsers are so under represented within Jenkins\nvisitors.\n( Source )\n\nTable 3. Browser Market Share on the Desktop\n\nBrowser\nUsage\n\nChrome\n63.59%\n\nFirefox\n13.75%\n\nIE\n8.86%\n\nSafari\n5.50%\n\nEdge\n4.35%\n\nConclusion\n\nThese observations should be carefully interpreted as it may be overestimated or underestimated (depending on various factors)  and doesn’t take into consideration local specificities.\n\nJenkins.io visitors are a majority of desktop users.\nThey are aligned with the world trends when we talk about desktop browsers however only a minority of them come from a mobile.\nThis is probably because jenkins.io is not (yet) mobile friendly and obsiously this would be a nice improvement to have.\n\nAll contributions are welcomed and especially for mobile user experience.","title":"Browser Market Share on jenkins.io","tags":["stats"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"olblak","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Olivier is the Jenkins infrastructure officer and Senior Operations Engineer at CloudBees.\nAs a regular contributor to the Jenkins infrastructure projects, he works on a wide range of tasks from services reliability to applications maintenance.</p>\n</div>","id":"olblak","irc":"olblak","linkedin":null,"name":"Olivier Vernin","slug":"/blog/author/olblak","twitter":"0lblak"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"stats","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
