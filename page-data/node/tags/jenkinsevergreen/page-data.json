While it’s not\nquite ready for users to start trying it out, we\ncontinue hacking away on all\nmanner of changes to support the safe and automatic upgrades of a running\nJenkins environment. In the meantime, Jenkins contributor\nBaptiste Mathus took some time to introduce and\ndemonstrate Jenkins Essentials at the recently held\nEclipseCon France,\n\nFrom the talk’s abstract:\n\nThe Jenkins Project is working on providing its users with a brand new,\nstrongly opinionated, and continuously delivered distribution of Jenkins:\nJenkins Essentials. Constantly self-updating, including auto-rollback, with\nan aggressive subset of verified plugins.\n\nIn this talk, we will detail how this works: how we run and upgrade Jenkins\nitself. How instances are continuously sending health data back to help\nautomated decision-making about the quality of given new release, and decide to\ngeneralize a given version of Jenkins to the whole fleet, or roll it back.\n\nWe will end giving an overview of the status of the project: how it’s managed\nin a fully open manner, from design to code and its infrastructure, and all the\nradical solutions to imagine and the upcoming challenges for the next months.\n\nI hope you enjoy the video\n\nYou can learn more about Jenkins Essentials from\nGitHub repository, or join us\non our\nGitter channel.","title":"Presenting Jenkins Essentials at EclipseCon France","tags":["jenkinsevergreen","evergreen"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"jenkinsevergreen","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
