A security advisory released yesterday by InfraDNA goes on to explain the hole with more detail:\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files in the\nserver file system whose path names are known, by sending malicious\nHTTP GET requests. While such access is still subject to the normal\naccess control enforced by the operating system, Hudson can still leak\n\"secrets\" possessed by Hudson\n\nThe vulnerability inside of Hudson affects Hudson instances running inside the embedded Winstone container, instances behind Glasshfish or Jetty (for example) are not subject to this vulnerability. Instances running behind a reverse proxy such as mod_proxy or Nginx.\n\nHudson system administrators should subscribe to either the security advisories RSS feed or the advisories@ mailing list\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from our OSL mirror or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Security Fix!

Along with the usual bunch of fixes, this release includes a number of localization updates courtesy of a team of Hudson community volunteers participating in the Hudson Internationalization project.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this post is being published on Tuesday, contrary to the schedule that I operated on with Continuous Blog, I will no longer be posting release updates on Monday morning. Traditionally Hudson is released Friday afternoon (PST), meaning any potential regressions are reported early on Monday morning after our European users start to upgrade. Publishing this release announcement on Tuesday gives me more time to test out the release so I can report with greater confidence in the reliability of the update. ( Note : This may change in the future as we push for easier RC testing capabilities within Hudson)\n\nIf you’re a regular reader of the Hudson Labs blog, you may also notice that this change log looks eerily similar to the 1.362 announcement from last week. Turns out I had mistakenly taken the upcoming changes from 1.363 and reported them as fixes in 1.362; I’ve since updated the post regarding 1.362’s change log.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nFix queue handling to close locking gap between removing job from queue and starting build, to prevent unintended concurrent builds (refactor of change first made in 1.360). ( report)\n\nAllow multiple dependencies between same two projects, as they may trigger under different conditions and with different parameters. ( issue 5708)\n\nTimeline on build trend page should use server timezone instead of always GMT. ( issue 6692)\n\nDon’t mask the cause of the checkout related exception.\n\n\"who am I?\" page should be visible to everyone.\n\nReinstall a JDK when a different version is selected. ( issue 5551)\n\nEnhancements\n\nAvoid pointless and harmful redirection when downloading agent.jar. ( issue 5752)\n\nCache downloaded JDKs.\n\nIntegrated community-contributed translations (Germany, Greek, Spanish, Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, French, Russian, Slovenian, Dutch, Traditional Chinese, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Portuguese.)\n\nUpgraded bundled Ant to version 1.8.1.

Of course, the work never stops on Hudson so we almost have 1.356 ready to roll out the door, but then Kohsuke tweeted this:\n\nBecause of the data center migration going on, I won’t be able to release #hudsonci today.\n\nI won’t go into details on some of the infrastructure changes we have lined up just yet, so here’s the breakdown of 1.355\n\nBugs fixed\n\nColored ball image at top of build pages was broken for Hudson in some web containers (fixed by removing workaround for a Firefox bug fixed since 3.0.5/Dec2008). ( issue 2341)\n\nConsole page while build is running did not wrap lines when viewed in IE. ( issue 5869)\n\nFixed build history to indicate test failure for MavenBuild and MavenModuleSetBuild.\n\nMake dropdownList work in repeatable content, such as a build step.\n\nEnhancements\n\nAdded the agent retention strategy based on a schedule.\n\nAdded to configure charset option of Mailer.\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.355 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links","releases"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","id":"55e4349a-57f0-5fe5-a05a-38af4c262c2e","slug":"/blog/2010/04/16/hudson-1-354-released/","strippedHtml":"Hear ye, hear ye! Behold, the first release of Hudson ever made by a not-employed-by-Sun Kohsuke (as we covered last week). This iteration of Hudson contains only bug fixes, check the listing below for the specifics on which bugs have been fixed (1.355 is looking like it will contain a number of fixes as well). The release of 1.354 comes slightly later than usual given some of the logistics that needed to, or still need to be resolved.\n\nOne of the infrastructure issues that’s half-way resolved is the question of Debian/Ubuntu packages. Kohuske has packages uploaded in an experimental apt repository on hudson-labs.org which you can try out. That said, it’s not entirely clear whether this is going to be the preferred means of distributing native Debian/Ubuntu packages in the future (your mileage may vary).\n\nBugs fixed\n\nPOM parsing was still using the module root as the base for relative paths for alternate settings files. ( issue 6080)\n\nFix dynamic updates of build history table when CSRF protection is turned on. ( issue 6072)\n\nImproved the error reporting mechanism in LDAP setting.\n\nRaw console output contains garbage. ( issue 6034)\n\nFixed a file handle leak in the agents connection. ( issue 6137)\n\nQuiet period wasn’t taking effect properly when doing parameterized builds.\n\nContributors\n\nThe release of 1.354 contains a total of 51 commits to the \"core\" part of the tree, from 9 different contributors\n\nabayer\n\ndrulli\n\nkohsuke\n\nmanuel_carrasco\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nswiest\n\nvlatombe\n\nwyukawa\n+\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.354 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links","releases"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"releases","limit":8,"skip":16,"numPages":3,"currentPage":3}},
