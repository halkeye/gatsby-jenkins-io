GSoC 2020 Phase 3 has ended now and it was a great period for thw Jenkins Windows Services - YAML Configuration Support project.\nIn this blog post, I will announce the updates during the GSoC 2020 - Phase 2 and Phase 3. If you are not already aware of this project,\nI would recommend reading this blog post which was published after GSoC 2020 - Phase 1.\n\nProject Scope\n\nWindows Service Wrapper - YAML configuration support\n\nYAML schema validation\n\nNew CLI\n\nXML Schema validation\n\nYAML Configuration Support\n\nUnder WinSW - YAML configurations support, these tasks will be done.\n\nYAML to Object mapping\n\nAt the moment YAML object mapping is finished and merged.\nYou can find all the implementations in this Pull Request.\n\nExtend WinSW to support both XML and YAML\n\nThis task is already done and merged. Find the implementation in this Pull Request.\n\nYAML Configuration support for Extensions\n\nAt the moment there are 2 internal plugins in WinSW. RunAwayProcessKiller and SharedDirectoryMapper.\nWe allow users to provide configurations for those plugins in the same XML and YAML configuration file which is used to configure WinSW. This task is merged as well.\nPull Request\n\nYAML schema validation\n\nUsers can validate YAML configuration file against JSON schema file.\nUsers can use YAML utility tool from Visual Studio market place to validate YAML config file against JSON schema.\n\nKey updates in Phase 2 and Phase 3\n\nYAML Configuration structure\n\nEnvironment variables\n\nNow users can provide environment variables as a sequence of dictionaries that contains name and value for environment variables.\n\nTimeStamp values\n\nUsers can specify timestamp values in the same manner used in XML (e.g. 10 ms, 5 sec, 3 min)\n\nYAML configuration document was published.

Jenkins on Windows\n\nWhy?\n\nIn theory, Jenkins can run everywhere where you can run Java 8 or Java 11, but, in practice, there are some limitations.\nThe Jenkins core and some plugins contain native code, and hence they rely on operating systems and platforms.\nWe use Java Native Access and Java Native Runtime libraries which provide wide platform support for low-level operations,\nbut there are platform-specific cases not covered by such generic libraries.\nIn the case of Windows platforms we use Windows Service Wrapper (WinSW) and\nWindows Process Management Library (WinP).\nThese libraries depend on particular Windows API versions and, in the case of Windows services, on .NET Framework.\n\nHistorically Jenkins had no documented support policy for Windows,\nand we were accepting patches for all versions which existed since the Hudson inception in 2004.\nIt became a serious obstacle for Windows component maintainers who had to be very conservative about incoming patches so that we could avoid breaking instances running on old platforms.\nLack of testing for older platforms did not help either.\nAnd it is not just about maintenance overhead.\nUsers were impacted as well, because it blocked us from adopting some new Windows features and making Jenkins more stable/maintainable on modern platforms.\n\nNew policy\n\nTo set proper expectations about Windows support,\nin the new policy we defined four support levels.\nSee the Windows support policy page for the actual information about the support levels and the supported platforms.\nThis blogpost captures the support state as of Jul 23, 2020:\n\nLevel 1 - Full Support\n\nWe run automated testing for these platforms, and we intend to timely fix the reported issues.\nThis support level includes 64-bit (amd-64) Windows Server versions with the latest GA update pack,\nand versions used in the official Jenkins server and agent Docker images.\n\nLevel 2 - Supported\n\nWe do not actively test these platforms, but we intend to keep compatibility.\nWe are happy to accept patches.\nThis support level includes 64-bit (amd64) Windows Server and Windows 10 versions generally supported by Microsoft.\n\nLevel 3 - Patches considered\n\nThe platforms are generally expected to work, but they may have limitations and extra requirements.\nWe do not test compatibility, and we may drop support if needed.\nWe will consider patches if they do not put Level 1/2 platforms at risk and if they do not create maintenance overhead.\nThis support level includes non-amd64 platforms like x86 (32-bit) and AArch64 (Arm).\nIt also applies to non-mainstream release lines like Windows Embedded, preview releases, and versions no longer supported by Microsoft.\n\nLevel 4 - Unsupported\n\nThese versions are known to be incompatible or to have severe limitations.\nWe do not support the listed platforms, and we will not accept patches.\nAt the moment this level applies to platforms released before 2008.\n\nWhen the policy was introduced, there were questions raised about platforms listed in the Level 3 support category.\nFirst of all, these platforms are still supported.\nUsers are welcome to run Jenkins on these platforms.\nWe recognize the importance of the platforms listed there, and we intend to keep compatibility with them.\nAt the same time, particular functionality may break there due to the lack of testing when we update Jenkins or upstream dependencies.\nIt may take a while until a fix is submitted by a user or contributor,\nbecause we do not maintain development environments for these platforms.\nBy setting a Level 3 support level, we want to set an explicit expectation about those limitations.\n\nIf you are interested in expanding the official Windows support policy and adding more platforms there,\nwe invite you to participate in quality assurance of Jenkins.\nYou may contribute by expanding test automation for Jenkins,\ncontributing test environments for your platforms,\nor participating in the LTS release candidate testing and reporting results.\nPlease contact us via Platform SIG channels if you are interested.\n\nWindows Service Management changes in Jenkins 2.248\n\nFigure 2. WinSW Logo\n\nAlthough the policy was introduced more than 1 month ago,\nJenkins 2.248 is the first release where the new policy is applied.\nStarting from this release, we wonâ€™t support .NET Framework 2.0 for launching the Jenkins server or agents as Windows services.\n .NET Framework 4.0 or above is now required for using the default service management features.\n\nThis release also upgrades Windows Service Wrapper (WinSW) from 2.3.0 to 2.9.0 and replaces the bundled binary from .NET Framework 2.0 to 4.0.\nThere are many improvements and fixes in these versions,\nbig thanks to NextTurn and all other contributors.\nYou can find the full WinSW changelog here,\njust a few highlights important to Jenkins users:\n\nPrompt for permission elevation when administrative access is required.\nNow Jenkins users do not need to run the agent process as Administrator to install the agent as a service from GUI.\n\nEnable TLS 1.1/1.2 in .NET Framework 4.0 packages on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.\n\nEnable strong cryptography when running .NET Framework 4.0 binaries on .NET 4.6.\n\nSupport security descriptor string in the Windows service definition.\n\nSupport 'If-Modified-Since' and proxy settings for automatic downloads.\n\nFix Runaway Process Killer extension so that it does not kill wrong processes with the same PID on startup.\n\nFix the default domain name in the serviceaccount parameter (jira:JENKINS-12660[])\n\nFix archiving of old logs in the roll-by-size-time mode.\n\nAs you may see, there are many improvements available with this version,\nand we hope that it will make Windows service installation even more reliable.\nSome of the changes in WinSW also replaced old workarounds in the Jenkins core,\nmaking the code more maintainable.\n\nUse-cases affected by .NET Framework 2.0 support removal\n\nIf you use .NET Framework 2.0 to run the Jenkins Windows services,\nthe following use-cases are likely to be affected:\n\nInstalling the Jenkins server as a Windows service from Web UI.\nThe official MSI Installer supports .NET Framework 2.0 for the moment, but it will be changed in future versions.\n\nInstalling agents as Windows services from GUI.\nThis feature is provided by in Windows Agent Installer Module from the Jenkins core.\n\nInstalling agents over Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) via the WMI Windows Agents plugin\n\nAuto-updating of Windows service wrappers on agents installed from GUI.\n\nUpgrade guidelines\n\nIf all of your Jenkins server and agent instances already use .NET Framework 4.0 or above,\nthere are no special upgrade steps required.\nPlease enjoy the new features!\n\nIf you run the Jenkins server as a Windows Service with .NET Framework 2.0,\nthis instance will require an upgrade of .NET Framework to version 4.0 or above.\nWe recommend running with .NET Framework 4.6.1 or above,\nbecause this .NET version provides many platform features by default\n(e.g. TLS 1.2 encryption and strong cryptography),\nand Windows Service Wrapper does not have to apply custom workarounds.\n\nIf you want to continue running some of your agents with .NET Framework 2.0,\nthe following extra upgrade steps are required:\n\nDisable auto-upgrade of Windows Service Wrapper on agents by setting the\n-Dorg.jenkinsci.modules.windows_slave_installer.disableAutoUpdate=true flag on the Jenkins server side.\n\nUpgrade agents with .NET Framework 4.0+ by downloading the recent Windows Service Wrapper 2.x\nversion from WinSW GitHub Releases\nand manually replacing the wrapper \".exe\" files in the agent workspaces.\n\nWhatâ€™s next?\n\nWe plan to continue expanding the Windows support in Jenkins,\nincluding providing official Docker images for newer Windows versions.\nFor example, there is already a pull request which will introduce official agent images for Windows Server Core LTSC 2019 and\nfor Windows Server Core and Nano Server 1909.\nWe are also interested to keep expanding test coverage for Windows platforms.\nAny contributions and feedback will be appreciated!\n\nWe also keep working on improving Windows Services.\nBuddhika Chathuranga, a Google Summer of Code 2020 student, is working on support for YAML Configurations in Windows Service Wrapper,\nand on better verification of XML and YAML Configurations.\nSee the details on the project page and in the\nCoding Phase 1 Report.\nIn addition to that, there is ongoing work on a new Windows Service Wrapper 3.0 release which will redesign CLI and introduce a lot more improvements.\nIf you are interested in contributing to Windows Service Wrapper,\nsee the guidelines here.\nWe will also appreciate your feedback on the WinSW Gitter channel.","title":"Jenkins 2.248: Windows Support Updates","tags":["announcement","windows","platform","winsw"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","id":"e374d21c-96c4-5212-b662-0867a675e5a2","slug":"/blog/2020/07/08/winsw-yaml-support/","strippedHtml":"Hello all, I am Buddhika Chathuranga from Sri Lanka and I am a final year undergraduate at the Faculty of IT, University of Moratuwa. I am participating in GSoC 2020 with Jenkins.\nI am working on the Windows Service Wrapper Project.\nSo the Coding Phase 01 of GSoC 2020 is now over and this blog post describes what I have done so far.\n\nWindows Service Wrapper is an executable, which we can use to run applications as Windows Services on Windows machines, which has almost one million downloads.\nIn Jenkins, we use Windows service wrapper to run Jenkins server and agents as Windows services to gain more robustness.\nThis feature is bundled into Jenkinsâ€™s core. Currently, the Windows Service wrapper is configured by an XML file.\nHowever, there is a limited number of configuration checks and there is no XML schema.\n\nXML is not such a human-friendly way to do that. It is quite verbose and not easy to identify the schema without some effort.\nUsually, users misconfigure the service wrapper. This is a sample XML configuration file that we can use to provide configurations to Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nSample XML Configuration File\n\njenkins\nJenkins\nThis service runs Jenkins automation server.\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_201\\bin\\java.exe\n-Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle\n    -jar \"C:\\Program Files\\Jenkins\\jenkins.war\" --httpPort=8081 --webroot=\"%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinswar\"\nrotate\n\n%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinsjenkins.pid\n10000\nfalse\n\nThe usage of YAML could simplify configuration management in Jenkins, especially when automated and configuration management tools are used.\nSo what we are doing under GSoC - 2020 is to update the Windows Service Wrapper to support YAML configurations.\nAfter finishing this project, users will be able to provide configurations to the Windows Service Wrapper as a YAML file.\n\nThis is a sample YAML configuration file for Windows Service Wrapper and you can see it is less verbose than XML or JSON and much more human friendly.\nUsers can read and edit this without a big effort.\n\nSample YAML Configuration File\n\nid: jenkins\nname: Jenkins\ndescription: This service runs Jenkins automation server.\nenv:\n    _name: JENKINS_HOME\n    _value: '%LocalAppData%\\Jenkins.jenkins'\nexecutable: 'C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_201\\bin\\java.exe'\narguments: >-\n    -Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle\n    -jar \"C:\\Program Files\\Jenkins\\jenkins.war\" --httpPort=8081 --webroot=\"%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinswar\"\nlogmode: rotate\nonfailure:\n    _action: restart\nextensions:\n    -\n        pidfile: '%LocalAppData%\\Jenkinsjenkins.pid'\n        stopTimeout: '10000'\n        stopParentFirst: 'false'\n        _enabled: 'true'\n        _className: winsw.Plugins.RunawayProcessKiller.RunawayProcessKillerExtension\n        _id: killOnStartup\n\nAdvantages of YAML as a configuration file\n\nIt is less verbose and much more human friendly than XML.\n\nSince YAML is not using extra delimiters, it is lightweight.\n\nNowadays YAML has become more popular among configuration management tools.\n\nProject Scope\n\nDuring this project, I will add the following features to Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nYAML Configuration support\n\nYAML Schema validation\n\nNew CLI for the Windows Service Wrapper\n\nSupport for XML Schema validation via XML Schema Definition (XSD)\n\nPhase 01 Updates\n\nIn GSoC - 2020 phase 01, I have done the following updates to the Windows Service Wrapper.\n\nProject Structure overview document. (Published)\n\nYAML configurations support (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nNew CLI (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nXML Schema validation (Not released yet) - Pull Request\n\nYou can find Phase 01 Demo slides in this link.\n\nBelow you can find more details about the deliverables listed above.\n\nProject Structure overview\n\nThe project structure overview document describes how files and directories are organized in the Windows Service Wrapper project.\nIt will help contributors as well as users, to understand the codebase easily.\nAlso, it helps me a lot to understand the codebase. You can find the document from the given link.\n\nYAML configurations support\n\nAs I explained before, in this project, configurations will be provided as a YAML file.\nI used YamlDotNet library which has more than 2.2k stars on GitHub, to deserialize the YAML file into an Object graph.\nIn this YAML file, users can specify configurations in a more structured way than in XML configuration files.\nAs an example, now users can specify all the log related configurations under the log config.\nUsers can specify all service account related configurations under serviceaccount config etc.\n\nAt the moment, I am working on a design document for YAML configuration support. I will add it to the GitHub Issue once ready\n\nNew CLI\n\nBefore moving into Phase 01 updates, itâ€™s better to explain why we needed a new CLI for Windows Service Wrapper.\nIn the early phases of Windows Service Wrapper, we will keep the XML configuration support as well.\nSo we should allow users to specify the configurations file separately.\nThe current approach is, configurations file should be in the same directory, where Windows Service Wrapper executable exists and the file name of the XML file should be the same as the Windows Service Wrapper executable file name.\nAlso, users should be able to redirect logs if they need to and they should be allowed to elevate command prompt using Windows Service Wrapper.\nAlso, we thought that itâ€™s better to allow users to skip schema validation if they needed. So we decided to move into a new CLI.\n\nAs I explained, after releasing this, users will have options in addition to commands.\nIt will make the WinSW CLI more flexible so that we can easily extend it later. These are the options users are allowed to use.\nThese options are available with all the commands except help and version\n\n--redirect / -r [string]\n\nUsers can specify the redirect path for the logs if needed\n\nNot required | Default value is null\n\n--elevated / -e [boolean]\n\nElevate the command prompt before executing the command\n\nNot required | Default value is false\n\n--configFile / -c [string]\n\nUsers can specify the configurations file as a path\n\nNot Required | Default value is null\n\n--skipConfigValidation / -s [boolean]\n\nUsers can skip schema validation for configurations file if needed\n\nNot required | Default value is true\n\n--help / -h\n\nUser can find what options are available with a particular command with this option\n\nThis option is available with the install command\n\n--profile / -f [boolean]\n\nIf this option is true, then users can provide a service account for installation explicitly.\n\nNot required | Default value is false\n\nWe used commandlineparser/commandline library to parse the command line argument which has more than 2k stars in GitHub. At a glance, the library is compatible with .NET Framework 4.0+, Mono 2.1+ Profile, .NET Standard, and .NET Core.\n\nXML Schema validation\n\nAs I mentioned before, there was no schema validation for XML in Windows Service Wrapper.\nHence, I was working on schema validation for XML. I use XSD to validate XML files. The XSD file will be shipped as an embedded resource with the executable.\nYou can find the XSD file in my pull request.\n\nFuture updates\n\nIn the next phase, for GSoC 2020 the listed deliverables features will be released and the YAML schema validation feature will be added.\nAlso, we hope to publish a design document for the new features, which will help contributors.\n\nHow to contribute\n\nYou can find the GitHub repository in this link. Issues and Pull requests are always welcome.\nAlso, you can communicate with us in the WinSW Gitter channel, which is a great way to get in touch and there are project sync up meetings every Tuesday at 13:30 UTC on the Gitter channel.\n\nSome useful links\n\nProject Page\n\nProject Repository\n\nGitter Channel\n\nYamlDotNet library\n\nCommand Line Parser library","title":"Windows Service Wrapper : YAML Configuration Support - GSoC Phase - 01 Updates","tags":["winsw","windows","jenkins","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"winsw","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
