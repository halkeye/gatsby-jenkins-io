As a beginner, translation might be\nthe easiest way to help the project. You don’t need to understand the whole context, even to create a ticket in the\nissue tracker system. Improvement of localization usually is minor. But some problems occurred soon,\nthere isn’t a native speaker of Chinese that could review my PRs. So, sometimes my PRs\nare delayed from being merged into master.\n\nSome contributors told me that I can start a thread at the mailing list. Normally, discussing at the mailing list\nis the open source community way. We got a lot of ideas for the localization from there. As a result,\nwe achieved some goals that I’d like to share here.\n\nJEP-216\n\nPreviously, language localization files were distributed in core and in each plugin.\nFor this proposal, each language has a single localization plugin, such as Chinese Localization plugin.\nFinally, Localization Support Plugin and\nChinese Localization plugin are able to support\nall types of localization resource files. From the plugins website,\nyou can see that there are already 13 000 installations.\nWe removed all Chinese localization files at the PR-4008.\n\nI really appreciate Daniel Beck for helping me to add localization support,\nLiam Newman helping me to review JEP-216, and many other community members.\n\nChinese Localization SIG\n\nWe believe that this SIG could help to improve Jenkins experience for Chinese users and gather more contributors\nfrom China. This SIG is responsible for maintaining the Chinese Jenkins website,\npromoting the Jenkins community in China in the social media with WeChat account. We publish translated blog\narticles, Jenkins release notes, JAM or other events at the WeChat account. For now, there are 1800 followers that can\nread our news from the last half a year.\n\nEspecially, I want to say thanks to Wang Donghui, Zhai Zhijun, and other contributors. They did a lot of contributions.\nI wish I could see more and more folks join us.","title":"A Big Step of the Chinese Localization","tags":["general","community","localization","chinese"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#989898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/77b35/linuxsuren.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/d4a57/linuxsuren.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/68974/linuxsuren.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/ef6ff/linuxsuren.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/8257c/linuxsuren.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/6766a/linuxsuren.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/22bfc/linuxsuren.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"LinuxSuRen","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Rick is a big fan of Jenkins, also as a contributor leading the Jenkins China community.</p>\n</div>","id":"linuxsuren","irc":null,"linkedin":"linuxsuren","name":"赵晓杰(Rick)","slug":"/blog/author/linuxsuren","twitter":"LinuxSuRen"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9488675b-0d5a-5055-8c7d-1ab61e7ad642","slug":"/blog/2019/02/05/jenkins-new-year-in-china/","strippedHtml":"At the time of the Spring Festival. I want to make a summary of some activities in the last year.\nYou might already notice that more and more Chinese contributors emerge in the Jenkins community.\nWe have a GSoC champion who is Shenyu Zheng.\nHe is a great example for other students. With the effort of three skilled engineers,\nmany Jenkins users could learn the edge technologies and useful use cases.\nThey co-organized several Jenkins Meetups in a couple of cities in China.\n\nThere are two workshops about Jenkins and Jenkins X in the DevOps International Summit. James Rawlings gave us a wonderful view of the Jenkins X. Many people start to know this project. The Chinese website of jx would be helpful to those people.\n\nOn November 3rd, 2018 the Jenkins User Conference China(JUCC) was hosted in Shenzhen. More than 200 attendees gathered at JUCC to share and discuss Jenkins, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Pipeline, and Agile.\n\nThere was a Jenkins workshop to teach users to develop a plugin in October. It was during the Hacktoberfest 2018. So some people got a beautiful T-shirt at this meetup. We’ll keep this event in 2019. I hope more users and developers could join us.\n\nThank you all folks. And other friendly contributors.\n\nChinese is our main communication language. A large number of the Jenkins users are not a proficient English speaker.\nSo letting most of Chinese Jenkins users could easily use Jenkins as their CI/CD platform is the final mission of Chinese Localization SIG.\nYou can find three participants on the page. But that’s not the full list.\nMore exciting thing is that Alauda giving a big support which as a startup company.\n\nWeChat is the greatest social media channel in China. WeChat has one billion users.\nAlmost everyone in China has a WeChat account. It must be a perfect place to publish articles and events.\nThere are over 1k people subscribed the Jenkins official WeChat Subscription Account in the last three months.\n\nIn the new year, I’m looking forward to growing up with you all!","title":"Jenkins new year in China","tags":["core","community","chinese"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#989898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/77b35/linuxsuren.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/d4a57/linuxsuren.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/19e71/linuxsuren.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/68974/linuxsuren.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/ef6ff/linuxsuren.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/8257c/linuxsuren.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/6766a/linuxsuren.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/e862ae9393b3993a9bb02d848cf1c9ab/22bfc/linuxsuren.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"LinuxSuRen","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Rick is a big fan of Jenkins, also as a contributor leading the Jenkins China community.</p>\n</div>","id":"linuxsuren","irc":null,"linkedin":"linuxsuren","name":"赵晓杰(Rick)","slug":"/blog/author/linuxsuren","twitter":"LinuxSuRen"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"2bba9081-9075-5138-b4bd-6bcf248a769e","slug":"/blog/2019/01/09/jenkins-user-conference-china-shenzhen-update/","strippedHtml":"On November 3rd, 2018 the Jenkins User Conference China (JUCC) met Jenkins users in Shenzhen which is the most burgeoning city in China.\nIt was the first time to hold JUCC in Shenzhen.\nWe held JUCC along with DevOps International Summit, which is the biggest DevOps event in China.\nMore than 200 attendees gathered at JUCC Shenzhen to share and discuss Jenkins, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Pipeline, and Agile.\n\nBelow, I am sharing pictures and some of the topics discussed at the event:\n\nYu Gu from Accenture presented New challenges for DevOps in Cloud Native.\n\nPeng Wang from Meituan which is the biggest group-buying website in China much like Groupon presented\nThe continuous delivery toolchains based on Jenkins for ten thousand times build per day.\n\nGuangming Zhou from Ctrip who is a Jenkins expert in China presented CD system in Ctrip.\n\nJiaqi Guo Jiaqi Guo from Kingston presented DevOps practices in large manufacturing industry.\n\nYaxing Li from Tencent presented How to support the CI CD requirements for thousands of products in Tencent based on Jenkins.\n\nMei Xiao from ZTE presented Fast integration practice for Android.\n\nJohn Willis presented Next Generation Infrastructure which included Kubernetes and  Istio practices.\n\nBC Shi from JD.com who is also a Jenkins Ambassador and the co-organizer of JUCC presented Pipeline 3.0  for DevOps toolchains.\nHe introduced the practices based on Jenkins and Jenkins X to build an end to end pipeline for DevOps from requirement to online service.\n\nWe’ve also released a DevOps tool map to recommend an excellent tool to the community.\n\nLastly, myself, Forest Jing co-organizer of JUCC and also am a Jenkins Ambassador interacted with the attendees.\n\nWe also organized the Jenkins workshop and Open space for the attendees.\nRuddy Li ,Yunhua Li , Yu Gu and Dingan Liang have worked together to run an open space to lead the attendees to discuss problems they met in DevOps and CD.\n\nHuaqiang Li who is a Certified Jenkins Engineer and CCJE has led the attendees to practice Jenkins functions for a whole afternoon.\n\nHere are more photos from our event, it was a fantastic JUCC in Shenzhen.\nThere were so much interest and appetite to learn about Jenkins and DevOps.\nWe are looking forward to doing this again next year.\n\nSlides from the event can be downloaded at PPT Download Address, password: sepe (the website is in Chinese).\n\nThank you to Alyssa and Maxwell’s help to organize this event.\nJenkins User Conference China continues and we hope to see many of you next year in China for our next JUCC.\nLet’s be Kung fu Jenkins!","title":"Jenkins User Conference China - Shenzhen Update","tags":["jenkins","jenkinsuserconference","chinese"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"ijyun","html":"","id":"ijyun","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Forest Jing（景韵）","slug":"/blog/author/ijyun","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"chinese","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
