The Jenkins Contributor Awards honor those who have made significant contributions to the Jenkins project.  The 2020 Jenkins Contributor Award winners are:\n\nMost Valuable Jenkins Contributor\n\nThis award is presented to an individual who has contributed to the Jenkins project the most through new features, bug fixes or plugin development efforts.\n\nTim Jacomb - Tim is everywhere in the Jenkins community: plugins, Jenkins core maintenance, Google Summer of Code, infrastructure, and new initiatives like GitHub App authentication and Dark Theme. His software, frontend and infrastructure skills help to push the Jenkins project forward. Several examples of features shipped by Tim in 2020: Read-only Jenkins configuration, GitHub App Authentication support, Jenkins Dark Theme and many other smaller features here and there. Tim is also the second most active code reviewer in the Jenkins core.\n\nJenkins Security MVP\n\nThis award is presented to the individual who most consistently provides excellent Jenkins security reports or resolves Jenkins security issues.\n\nJames Holderness - Security issues reported by James have been included in nine of the nineteen security advisories published by the Jenkins project in the last 12 months. His issue reports have detected many cases where sensitive information was being stored insecurely by plugin maintainers. Jenkins users and the Jenkins security team are sincerely grateful for the issue reports that James has provided.\n\nMost Valuable Jenkins Advocate\n\nThis award is presented to an individual who has helped advocate for Jenkins through organization of a local Jenkins Area Meetup(s), or virtual equivalent.\n\nMarky Jackson -  Marky has been very active in many Jenkins advocacy & Outreach initiatives.
