On September 8th, Håkon Snøtun will be presenting \"Top 5 plugins for Hudson and Chuck Norris.\" and on September 9th, I’ll be presenting \"Getting more out of your Hudson.\"\n\nBut more importantly, what is a conference without drinking!? So in that spirit, InfraDNA will be organizing a Hudson User Meetup at The Scotsman from Sep 8th 19:30 ( website.) We’ll get together, have some drinks, and enjoy geeky conversations.\n\nSo if you are local or visiting Oslo for JavaZone, come join us. If you plan to join us at The Scotsman, please RSVP, and watch out for my twitter updates for any last minute time/location changes.","title":"Hudson at JavaZone, Meetup in Oslo ","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","id":"daf4fa9f-3809-53bb-979c-b9a11be2e70a","slug":"/blog/2010/08/30/pre-javaone-hudson-meetup/","strippedHtml":"As we near autumn up here in the Northern Hemisphere, the wind is starting to blow a bit chillier and here in the Bay Area that can only mean one thing: Oracle is suing everybody! it’s time for JavaOne!\n\nA whole lot has changed since last year, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle, Kohsuke left Snoracle to found InfraDNA and Hudson has continued to power on as the single best continuous integration server on the planet.\n\nWhile the tickets for Oracle OpenWorld/JavaOne are just as outrageously expensive as they were last year, we are hosting a meetup/hackathon/continuous-drinking-contest at Digg the Sunday prior. We have not yet set any kind of agenda, but some core Hudson hackers and plenty of plugin developers should be in town so it should be a great time hacking on and/or with Hudson.\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/hudsonmeetup/calendar/14515128/\n\nWhen: September 19th, 1:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Digg’s Office: 1040 Mariposa St - Suite 100, San Francisco, CA 94107\nhttps://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=embed&hl=en&geocode=&q=1040+Mariposa+St+-+Suite+100+San+Francisco,+CA+94107&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=39.780156,78.662109&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1040+Mariposa+St,+San+Francisco,+California+94107&ll=37.764201,-122.394304&spn=0.020356,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=A\n\nUnlike last year, we’re trying to organize this with Meetup.com, if you experience any difficulties RSVPing let us know","title":"Pre-JavaOne Hudson Meetup","tags":["general","just for fun","meetup","javaone"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","id":"06839a62-5b96-5e18-85d0-180621816c20","slug":"/blog/2010/08/29/hudson-user-meet-up-in-copenhagen-oslo/","strippedHtml":"I’ll be in Copenhagen from 9/5-9/7 and in Oslo 9/8-9/9 to present in JavaZone.

I see this as yet another validation to Hudson, and as such, I welcome this new addition to the community and wish them well! — more companies betting on Hudson means we’ll get more investment to the project, which is all goodness for Hudson users. It’s been 5 months since I left Oracle to start InfraDNA, and I was initially worried about a possible negative impact on adoption, but instead Hudson has shown with no sign of slowing down (see picture on the right, from Andrew’s report, which shows # of estimated active installations that participates to our usage stats survey). And InfraDNA is going well too - we’ve helped companies big and small to improve their Hudson usage/adoption, and our commercial value-add Hudson distribution is getting plenty of interest.\n\nHosted Hudson offers an interesting trade-off, compared to on-premises Hudson. On the plus side, given the current hourly pricing of public clouds like EC2 and Rackspace, you get a better pricing model, as CloudBees charge by minutes. You also get rid of machines and upfront cost, which is great for small business. On top of that, you can also expect them to gradually develop more value-adds and better integration to various other pieces, which can get really interesting.\n\nOn the down side, you have less control over the environment that runs the builds, and you do not have access back to your intranet environment (think databases that you need to talk to, for example.) Also, in the current pricing (8.5 cents/hour of EC2 vs 1 cent/minute of CB), if your build takes longer than 9 minutes, you’ll save more by just using Hudson EC2 plugin.\n\nOn a related note, I think one of the sweet spots is Hudson that’s well integrated with on-premises cloud solution. As you can see in the discussion with Liferay Hudson setup, with sufficient load it gets cheaper to have your own hardware, and many companies need some degree of control to the build/test environment that matches with their production environment. Plus with those on-premises virtualized environments, you can do snapshots and forks, which can be made to do very interesting things.\n\nFinally, I think the part that everyone can agree on is that the elasticity of build environment is hugely useful to the CI environment, as I discussed in my JavaOne 2009 talk ( slides.) I’m very happy to see that the foundation work we’ve made in Hudson for this is getting validated more and more, and I think the added elasticity will drive a lot more changes in Hudson and more broadly into the way we develop software. It is an exciting time!","title":"CloudBees announce Hudson-as-a-Service","tags":["general","core"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"685bfc55-97fd-5448-894a-707a72830f64","slug":"/blog/2010/08/20/hudson-sauce-ondemand-webinar/","strippedHtml":"On September 1st, I’ll be presenting in a Sauce Labs webinar about Hudson and Sauce OnDemand.

The reporting feature has been sending information back to the Hudson team to help us understand how Hudson is used in aggregate; the info being reported includes the number of jobs configured, agent configurations, what plugins (and what versions of those plugins) are installed, and more. This data has not been available publicly until now! The raw data needed to be decrypted and scrubbed of any potentially identifying information, such as non-public plugin names or usernames in snapshot versions. We’ve finally scrubbed the data and are making it available!\n\nThe data is currently in monthly JSON bundles, organized by unique install key. We’ve filtered out reports of installations without any jobs configured, as well as any installations with only one report in a given month.\n\nIf you’d like access to the data, please send an email to dev@hudson.dev.java.net or jump onto the IRC channel and ask - we’ll send you the URL and a private username/password which you’ll need to access the info. We’re also planning to do more analysis of the data ourselves, for now feast your eyes on this spreadsheet, which shows the total number of unique installations seen per month and the number of unique installations of each publicly available plugin per month.","title":"Hudson Anonymous Usage Data","tags":["general","core","just for fun","meta","news","plugins","jenkinsci"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","id":"71e48d7e-2b08-5efc-a470-7aad0b1e8664","slug":"/blog/2010/08/16/hudsonmobi-2-0-hits-the-android-market/","strippedHtml":"The folks over at LMT Software just released their HudsonMobi 2.0 to the Android market.
