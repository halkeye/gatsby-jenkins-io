This year, there are whopping 6 sessions that discuss Jenkins (including myself, which is the very first session in Monday!) Unfortunately some of them happen in the same time, but I for one am looking forward to seeing the mobile app test talk from Intuit.\n\nCON6256 - Large-Scale Automation with Jenkins (Monday 8:30am, Hilton)\n\nJenkins is the most adopted open source continuous integration server today, and beyond the automated build and test, it is a platform for launching all kinds of automation tasks. As the use of Jenkins grows inside an organization, people are automating complex activities that need to be choreographed—such as deploying an application, running a load test, cleaning up the environment, and then handing over the build to the operation team. Such orchestration of activities is a very useful building block for continuous delivery, a practice promoted in recent years. This session looks at various patterns and plug-ins that deal with this kind of choreography. It also briefly discusses what’s new in recent versions of Jenkins.\n\nCON3648 - Take Your Mobile Applications Tests to the Next Level: Continuous Integration (Monday 1pm, Hilton)\n\nMobile tests today can be automated by popular mobile testing frameworks in Java such as monkeyrunner, Sikuli, and Robotium. However, getting mobile tests running in continuous integration is not widely understood and rarely implemented. Whether you are an experienced mobile developer or tester or new to the mobile field, this session informs you about the complexities of emulators and devices and how you can navigate through each challenge to integrate mobile tests into Jenkins. You will be guided step-by-step through two case studies on how to integrate native Android and iPhone application tests by using monkeyrunner and Sikuli, respectively, into Jenkins. Leave with Java code samples of these automated tests as well as practical knowledge of mobile devices and emulators.\n\nCON2822 - Real-World Strategies for Continuous Delivery with Maven and Jenkins (Tuesday 10am, Hilton)\n\nMaven is close to ubiquitous in the world of enterprise Java, and the Maven dependency ecosystem is the de facto industry standard. However, the traditional Maven build and release strategy, based on snapshot versions and carefully planned releases, is difficult to reconcile with modern continuous delivery practices, where any commit that passes a series of quality-control gateways can qualify as a release. How can teams using the standard Maven release process still leverage the benefits of continuous delivery? This presentation discusses strategies that can be used to implement continuous delivery solutions with Maven and demonstrates one such strategy using Maven, Jenkins, and Git.\n\nCON12570 - Pragmatic Continuous Delivery (Tuesday 10am, Hilton)\n\nWhen you send a package via FedEx, it goes through a tracked, automated process that makes sure the package arrives promptly at the destination. Continuous delivery describes how this process can similarly be made fully automated and transparent, with your commits “fedexed” to production. The focus of continuous delivery is the delivery pipeline. Every commit that enters the pipeline should go through automated integration and testing, and if successful, produce a release candidate. This presentation is based on a demo that uses Jenkins to orchestrate the delivery pipeline; Nexus for long-running and manual workflows; and LiveRebel to make production updates quick, automated, nondisruptive, and reversible.\n\nCON3363 - HTML5 Testing in All Browsers with Java (Tuesday 11:30am, Parc 55)\n\nWould you love to test your HTML5 app in all browsers? The biggest challenge in writing HTML5 applications is that your application must run on many platforms, ranging from old desktop browsers to cutting-edge mobile browsers. Each browser behaves nearly the same, but inconsistencies can lead to major bugs. In this session, JavaOne Rockstar and Java Champion Kevin Nilson shows how you can leverage open source Java tools to test your HTML5 application in all browsers. The presentation shows examples of using tools such as TestSwarm, QUnit, jQuery, Jenkins/Hudson, Oracle VM VirtualBox, GlassFish Server technology, and Sun SPOTs to test your HTML5 application in all browsers.\n\nCON12983 - Java PaaS: The Engine for Delivering Enterprise and Mobile Applications (Wednesday 8:30am, Parc 55)\n\nAttend this demo-filled session that shows you how to use Java platform as a service (PaaS) to deploy complete enterprise applications in the cloud with Eclipse, Jenkins, and MySQL in addition to iOS/Android clients and full end-to-end continuous integration. In a few minutes, you’ll have cloud-based Git/SVN repositories set up with CI builds triggered automatically and your apps, databases, and supporting services up and running live. The presentation also shows how you can add more PaaS services—ALM, Web monitoring and analytics, hosted log management, e-mail integration, enterprise search, cloud DB services, and much more—to your apps right off the bat. Experience the future of Java development!\n\n+\n +\nAnd it looks like the jclouds session will also touch jgroups plugin: +\n +\n\nCON8009 - What’s New in jclouds 1.5 (Monday 10am, Parc 55)\n\njclouds 1.5 is the result of 3.5 years of development by nearly 100 developers interested in portable cloud computing. During this session, you’ll get up-to-date with cloud computing technology developments such as OpenStack. You’ll learn how to use jclouds 1.5 to control private and public infrastructures and storage clouds programmatically. You’ll also see examples of new tools powered by jclouds, including Jenkins and Brooklyn.","title":"Jenkins sessions at JavaOne","tags":["general","javaone"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"a9d59619-964b-56f6-8905-740dfe1e1ee6","slug":"/blog/2012/09/24/jenkins-project-meeting-in-the-meat-space-call-for-agenda/","strippedHtml":"As you may or may not know, the Jenkins project has a bi-weekly IRC meeting where we discuss and decide on things necessary to keep the project running.\n\nNext Sunday, we’ll bring this project meeting live to Jenkins User Conference San Francisco.\n\nSince this is an unique opportunity to engage people who don’t normally come to these meetings, I’d like to encourage everyone to propose agenda items and add it to the agenda page.\n\nThe Wiki page lists all the past meetings, so you can get a sense of what it is like. But this time, we hope to have a good number of users to the meeting, not just project insiders. So if you have things you’d like to get users feedback on, or if you like project insiders to update you on things, please don’t hesitate to add them.\n\nI still need to work on the logistics, but the plan is to do a cross-over with IRC — I’d like to show the IRC client projected in the room, so that people in the room can see the conversation in IRC, and I’d like either real-time transcribing of voice conversations to IRC and/or live broadcasting of the room.","title":"Jenkins project meeting in the meat space / Call for agenda","tags":["general","feedback","meetup","javaone","juc"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d4867bb0-ff33-5539-975b-5a3b1b0d36e3","slug":"/blog/2012/09/21/start-your-own-jenkins-meetup-in-10-easy-steps/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/IMAG0786.jpg[image,width=200] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n... and be a https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program[Jenkins CIA agent] too! If you're interested in building an active local Jenkins community, read on to learn how. Really, we can sum it up in one simple step: +\n +\n\nJust Do It!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nAdmittedly more detailed guidelines can be useful, so hopefully these steps will give you a roadmap and some ideas: +\n +\n\n+\nFind an organizer or two. This is probably you. If you can draft a friend, colleague, or random acquaintance or three to help, even better. To enlist additional help in your area, put the word out on the Jenkins Dev email list and on your Twitter account using the hashtag #JenkinsCI.\n\n+\nLet the Jenkins project know. Let us know so that we can help you. We can promote it on the JenkinsCI blog, promote that on Twitter, and post a summary blog. We can send stickers for you to hand out in the meetup, and we can send you a T-shirt for you to wear. We might be even able to find you additional agents I mean helpers in your city. And if you’re recording the event or streaming it live (we can tell you how), the whole Jenkins world may want to know!\n\n+\nDecide how often you want to meet. Once a month is a good frequency, but if you feel like all you can manage is every two months or even every quarter, go for it! You can always change it.\n\n+\nGo to Meetup.com. We have an account that we can let you use, or you can create your own meetup. They make it very easy to manage attendance and also to spread the word to people with similar interests in your community.\n\n+\nDetermine the topic for your first meetup. You could feature a speaker or two, or host a panel discussion, or just get folks together to talk about how you use Jenkins. YOU would probably be a great speaker for your first meetup – or perhaps some of your colleagues or friends. If you prefer to stay behind the scenes, Twitter and the Jenkins Dev list can help you find a speaker too. And as your meetup grows, you’ll have an automatic pool of interested parties.\n\n+\nCome up with a format for the meetup. Here’s an idea for a schedule:\n6-6:30pm: Check in, Networking & Munchies\n6:30-6:35: Announcements\n6:35-7:15: Speaker/panel (can also have 2 speakers, which might go longer)\n7:15-7:30: Q&A\n7:30: Wrap up, chat\n8:00: Say goodnight, or go out together and keep drinking\n\n+\nFind a venue, preferably a free one. Ideally, your company or one you know can host… then the venue is free. Alternate solutions: hotels (which unfortunately cost $$$) or reserve a room at a local bar or restaurant. Sometimes a university or even a library can help out with a free room.\n\n+\nAsk a company or two to sponsor the meetup, which consists of paying for food and drinks for all (and some companies will bring along SWAG). Often the company hosting the venue will also sponsor. Sponsoring is a great way for companies to generate positive publicity in their locale, to get the word out that they’re hiring, and to support the Jenkins community in general.\n\n+\nPlan the room logistics. Consider how you want the room to be set up – theater style or as individual tables to encourage group discussions. Also make arrangements to secure a projector and screen. It’s a good idea to bring along connectors for both Mac and PC.\n\n+\nGet the word out in any way you can. Some ideas:\n\nTell us so that we can promote it through our existing channels.\n\nIf you use Meetup.com, they’ll help get the word out. And as more people join to attend one meetup, they’ll receive word about future meetups too. EventBrite is also good about suggesting events in your area that might interest you.\n\nEmail folks at your company who might be interested\n\nEmail friends and former colleagues and ask them to spread the word\n\nPost the event to your Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn profiles\n\nIf you know of any calendars that highlight local Tech events in your area, post your meetup there. Likewise for any Tech email digests you may receive.\n\n+\n\n+\n +\nAdditional tips: +\n\nGet someone to record the event. Doesn’t have to be professional quality – a Flip cam or SmartPhone can take perfectly usable video (just make sure they can record long enough!). Better yet, stream it live if you can! Broadcasting makes the event accessible to the world, not just your community, and word will travel even farther! As well, future speakers can get an idea for how your group does things.\n\nPlan that ~50% of the people who RSVP won’t make it. It’s a free event, and plans tend to change. Order food and drink accordingly.\n\nRemember that free food and BEvERages are strong motivators! Pizza, giant subs, or other local favorite are great choices. For BEvERages, you’re probably fine with beer, Coke and water.\n\nBring a sign-in sheet and name tags (and pens).\n\nConsider asking the sponsor to bring SWAG or raffle off something cool (maybe even their product or service).\n\nAt the beginning or end of the meetup, ask attendees to suggest topics they want to cover in future meetups. Or have them write down suggestions and put them in a box (then maybe raffle off a prize from the pool of contributors).\n\nVary the format of your meetup – presentation, Birds of a Feather discussion, hackathon, lightning talks, white board night, Jenkins problem-solving session… all of these may interest your audience. If you can, switch the venue as well – that way people get to see other interesting companies, and can also choose to attend meetups that may be more convenient to them.\n\nStart and end on time. If things start to run over, you can always break and let people know they can go if they need to, but are welcome to stay if they like.\n\nJoin forces with other groups when you can – this builds up both of your groups! For example, host a joint Jenkins-Selenium group on the topic of Testing with Jenkins.\n\n+\n +\nStill have questions? https://twitter.com/jenkinsci[Give us a holler]! +\n +\n +\n**Special thanks to our friends at https://www.saucelabs.com[Sauce Labs] for some of this content — they wrote https://sauceio.com/index.php/2011/10/so-you-want-to-start-a-selenium-meetup-group-now-what/[a similar guide] for starting Selenium meetups.","title":"Start Your Own Jenkins Meetup in 10 Easy Steps","tags":["general","cia","meetup"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","id":"63d0593a-8c6c-5de0-8378-c28c4b7c4062","slug":"/blog/2012/09/12/jenkins-user-event-cph/","strippedHtml":"This article was originally posted on my personal blog\n\n+\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U254sLok_CA/UEyaAzMGpYI/AAAAAAAAHuI/--wuCdF0j2Y/s1600/IMAG0397.jpg[image:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U254sLok_CA/UEyaAzMGpYI/AAAAAAAAHuI/--wuCdF0j2Y/s640/IMAG0397.jpg[image,width=640,height=102]]\n\n+\n +\n +\nLast week, https://www.praqma.com/[praqma] was organizing in Copenhague a \"Jenkins User Event\".

I contribute a group to solve an integration issue by https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/558[creating a new extension] point in jenkins-core.

To reduce costs for such an event, compared to other Jenkins Conferences organized by CloudBees this year, lunch was not provided and conference program was \"packed\" into afternoon. This let praqma get a \"reasonable\" cost for this nice event, but still have a high quality conference, with printed programs, goodies, and coffee break. All praqma team was involved to make this event as pleasant as possible for all attendees, thanks a lot to them for contributing ! +\n +\n +\n +\nConference was sold-out on friday morning, with 80 attendees. +\n +\n +\n +\nAfter Lars Kruse welcome speak, and CloudBees to announce partnership with Praqma for DK, the conference started with two options : either an introduction to Jenkins, or an open-space discussion (~barcamp-like) for those that already know it well. I joined a small group first discussing about pre-tested commit, and then we divert speaking about best-practices, job and test performances issues, etc. Was a great exchange with interesting feedback. +\n +\n +\n +\nThe rest of the conference was single-track. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oCA1lQnDBeE/UEybtag0JmI/AAAAAAAAHuY/QSofsZ_ae1M/s1600/IMAG0408.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oCA1lQnDBeE/UEybtag0JmI/AAAAAAAAHuY/QSofsZ_ae1M/s400/IMAG0408.jpg[image,width=400,height=300]]\n\n+\n +\n +\n1rst session was about \"_facilitate strategic reuse of software_\" using jenkins CI. This session exposed how a industrial company changed it's internal software development practices and team organization to share components and be more efficient. This for sure introduced some coordinations and integration costs but resulted in a significant productivity improvement. This talk was interesting as it demonstrate that highly industrial companies (here, a low energy consuming water pumps producer) today follow development practice to share component and use continuous integration practice to help. I just wondered speaker said \"Clearcase facilitated\" sharing components  -I wouldn't expected those two words in same sentence :P +\n +\n +\n +\n\"_Tales from the trenches_\" was a funny session explaining how Nokia came from stone age (manual integration with code freezes) to modern development practices. After reinventing the wheel with ~15 home made, perl-script based CI tools, they switched to Jenkins and Git as common tooling. Explanation on Git selection, evaluating multiple DVCS popularity, then migration from ClearCase, [.underline]#helping a lot# early adopters, and later evaluating benefits (1 day / week / developer) was very interesting. Conclusion was that, \"some tools a radically better\" and \"deep process renewal depends heavily on tools renewal\". +\n +\n +\n +\n\"_Continuous Code Inspection_\" talk explained use of industrial C++ coding standard and normative coding convention, with dedicated analysis tools. After explanation on those rules and tooling, a dedicated jenkins plugin was demonstrated. Such jenkins integration makes QA mostly a single checkbox to enable, and provide history graphs, reports, and external tools integration. Introduction was a little slow imho but content was demonstrating the power of jenkins plugin model to adapt software factory to specific industrial needs. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vgq2K5JLj30/UEyfE86usmI/AAAAAAAAHuw/q4vbgqguyuY/s1600/IMAG0409.jpg[image:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vgq2K5JLj30/UEyfE86usmI/AAAAAAAAHuw/q4vbgqguyuY/s320/IMAG0409.jpg[image,width=320,height=240]]\n\n+\n +\n +\nCoffee break with delicious Danish chocolates ... +\n +\n +\n +\nSony was presenting its \"_Huge Jenkins Cluster_\", with 4 controllers, some of them handling up to 6000 jobs, 300 agents, 7000 builds a day an executing 175,000 tests a day for android platforms. Development teams use a dedicated agent machine with android devices connected through USB. +\n +\n +\n +\nSuch a build farm requires a dedicated support team and monitoring/maintenance tooling. IT only provides the computer and maintain the OS, but all Jenkins stuff is under the hands of a dedicated team. They evaluate plugins and core upgrades, educate teams, and analyse errors. +\n +\n +\n +\nWith 45Gb for a single full android build, they have to monitor available disk space, and developed maintenance scripts to delete old build artifacts and cleanup /tmp. They also use a local git mirror to speed-up cloning, and integrated with CFEngine-managed infrastructure to ensure no update occurs as a agent is running a build. They also significantly optimized build speed by switching from NFS to SAN, and are now evaluating XFS. +\n +\n +\n +\nRemaining issue is about jenkins build queue (subject discussed on Jenkins Code Camp) because a 9 in the morning, thousand users connect to jenkins controller and the UI widget to expose the queue status hits the queue synchronisation bottleneck. +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\nNext talk was mine, exposing https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb[Jenkins Enterprise] and demonstrating one ouf our Enterprise plugins. I'm not pleased by my talk, both because my english is crappy (maybe you already noticed?) and also because I was not confident with the standard JE slides. Assuming I had more time to prepare this talk, and as a tribute to this Danish event, I'd have used a bunch of lego bricks pictures to present Cloudbee plugins. So I quickly left the slides to run a demo, setting-up Jenkins Enterprise to run https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb[pre-tested commits].

This light, generalist talk was welcome as last one after a heavy-technical afternoon. Lars exposed reason to switch to open-source : +\n +\n +\n +\n\ncosts - for sure,\n\nbut also open standards and interoperability,\n\nand contribution to public good.\n\n+\nThis last point distinguish \"_innovators_\" that create new content and contribute to the oss project, and \"_free riders_\" that only want to save money and consume other efforts. Lars didn't went deeper into what \"contributing\" can be about, but spending some time joining the mailing lists, exposing detailled bug report, or writing blogs or documentation about the issues you encounter is already a huge contribution to opensource.

The first meet-up in June was only announced 8 days before, but had very good attendance  - the second was completely booked (15 seats).\n\nThe agenda is a short presentation of continuous integration and software validation to inspire the use of Jenkins, then a few words and terms about Jenkins and finally a live demo.\nThe live demo starts from scratch by downloaded the latest Jenkins java web archive, starts it, define a job on one of our Maven based java projects on Github. We add two easy plugins (Warnings and Task Scanner). Second part of the demo is about unit testing and coverage and we show how easy it is to enable a JUnit report and add a Cobertura coverage report if there is already unit tests for the project.\n\nThe meetups have about 90 minutes scheduled, including questions and the discussion session after the demo, where we serve pizza, beer and cola. The theoretical presentation and live demo is typically finished within one hour, even though we encourage our guests to ask questions and discuss whatever comes into their mind on the way. The relatively short time used for the introduction demonstrates how easy it is to get started with continuous integration and software validation using Jenkins.\n\nAs the live demo is based on a Java/Maven project we ask the guests about their technologies and try to relate that to their setup, so they know there also is an easy approach for them to use Jenkins.\n\nThe meeting is quite informal, and limited to 15 participants, leaving plenty of time to dicsuss and answer questions both before and after the meeting. We are always a few developers from Praqma to facilitate the discussions about the participants individual setup and questions.\n\nThese informal discussions are one of the main gains for us in Praqma, as it  is very interesting to share our experience with our guests and hear about all of their interesting challenges, that might have brough them north of Copenhagento attend our meeting.\n\nBecause these first meet-ups have been so popular and interesting we have decided to arrange them regularly in the future. Not just the Jenkins introduction, which will be repeated as long as there is an interest, but we are also making plans for meetups about Git, Mercurial and other topics.\n\nIf you’re interested in more Jenkins and CI related meet-ups in the Copenhagen area, visit our homepage or follow the #pragma hashtag on Twitter.\n\nWe also have a Jenkins User Event in Copenhagen coming in September.","title":"Report: Intro to Jenkins meet-up in Copenhagen","tags":["general","meetup","jenkinsci"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"general","limit":8,"skip":152,"numPages":33,"currentPage":20}},
