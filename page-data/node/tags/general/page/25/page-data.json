Conveniently, they are all events I’ll be attending while traveling around Western Europe!\n\nThe Cologne JUG is having a meetup on Saturday, June 25th, starting at 2pm. We’ll be talking about Jenkins, maybe doing some coding, and then heading out for drinks and more talk! You can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA few days later, TNG Technology Consulting is generously hosting a meetup in Munich, on Wednesday, June 30th, starting at 3pm. I’ll be giving a quick talk on the state of the Jenkins project, followed by Ullrich Haffner (the author of the static analysis plugins for Jenkins) giving a quick talk on how those plugins are used. After that, we’ll be having a hackathon, and then more beer! Again, you can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA week later, the London CI meetup group is hosting a meetup as well, on Wednesday, July 6th, starting at 6:30pm. We’ll be meeting up at the Royal Festival Hall for discussion and drinking. You can find more information and sign up at Meetup.\n\nDo you have a Jenkins event you’d like to have added to our calendar?

Jenkins is here to help!  With the Join Plugin you can do just that.  Over on the confluence page it’s got a number of examples and fancy flow charts.  But the take-away is that if you can describe the flow, you can make it happen.

But this is not true. +\n +\n\n+\nAs Jenkins gains traction among .NET developers, it's becoming increasingly clear that Java is very alien to them. They naturally have no idea of what a war file means, and often don't even have Java installed, and so it was _just not easy enough_ for them to start using Jenkins. +\n +\n\n+\nI'm happy to report that I've finally fixed this problem with the new Windows installer. It is primarily packaged as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer[an MSI file] — a common format that seasoned Windows devs/admins are familiar with. It can, for example, be deployed remotely on a large number of servers via Active Directory remotely. Or you can just double-click it to install it interactively. It bundles JRE, so no separate Java installation is needed. +\n +\n\n+\nThe package also contains the bootstrap `+setup.exe+`, to install .NET 2.0 runtime if it's not installed yet. Between that and JRE, it got all the dependencies covered. I tested that by installing it on a fresh Windows XP install. +\n +\n\n+\nSo I hope this makes Jenkins more attractive to .NET and other developers who live and die by Windows.","title":"Windows installers are now available","tags":["general","releases","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"598cdaff-a8e7-5d08-a3d6-2a93f385d234","slug":"/blog/2011/03/21/the-polls-are-open-for-the-jenkins-logo-contest/","strippedHtml":"After a number of absolutely fantastic logo submissions from a number of designers, I’m extremely pleased to open the polls on the vote for the brand new Jenkins logo!\n\nThe thumbnails do not do any of these logos justice in my opinion, so I recommend opening each logo up in its own tab to get the full effect :)\n\nI plan to end voting March 28th at 12:01 UTC.\n\nThe Logos\n\nLogo #1\nLogo #2\nLogo #3\n\nLogo #4\nLogo #5\nLogo #6\n\nLogo #7\nLogo #8\nLogo #9\n\nLogo #10\nLogo #11\n\nThe Vote\n\nIf the iframe doesn’t properly load for you, you can open Loading...\" class=\"bare\">https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dE9GNlpNbVEwa0VPZHl1TkJCaUI1Z2c6MQ Loading...","title":"The polls are open for the Jenkins Logo Contest!","tags":["general","feedback","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
