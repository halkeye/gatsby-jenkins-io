The Hudson community in general has\nalways been incredibly supportive and friendly, but the outpouring of support from\nfriends and users who’ve not previously spoken up has been awe inspiring.\n\nThat said, let’s get down to business. As I covered\nyesterday there is some\nbubbling frustration within the developer community regarding some project\ninfrastructure decisions and Oracle’s reactions to them. If you can’t spare the\ntime to read that novel of a blog post, the extremely shortened version is: devs want to\nmove codebase to GitHub, Oracle disagrees and claims to have final say (hijinks\nensue).\n\nWhile there is still a lot unresolved, several of the core contributors are\ndebating and weighing our options for moving forward in a way that best\nsuits Hudson both as a project and community. In the next couple days, Kohsuke\nor Andrew will be proposing a course of action for the community after some of\nthe options have been fully vetted. Please bear in mind that Hudson is a very big project with some fairly unique needs. We have hundreds of contributors committing either to core or the plugins, we release core once a week with plugin releases occurring to the tune of 20-40 updates a week. We’ve been pinging folks who work with various foundations and major open source projects to make sure we’re covering all our bases to make sure distractions like this don’t come up again for the foreseeable future.\n\nDue to issues with MySQL, Java, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, there is clearly a lot of anti-Oracle emotion out there right now, but I want\nto make sure that it’s clear that this is not about \"Us versus Oracle.\"\n\nOur goal isn’t to \"stick it to the man,\" that doesn’t help make Hudson any better.\n\nOur goal is to foster the kind of community that we all want to\nparticipate in, and to build and improve the best continuous integration\nserver available.\n\nStay tuned :)\n---","title":"A brief update","tags":["general","core","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

In case you haven’t been following along at home, I’ll try to catch you up as impartially as possible.\n\nThe Facts\n\n2009.06.02 : After substantial problems with Java.net infrastructure, the\ndev community discusses new infrastructure\noptions,\nincluding SourceForge, Google Code, Kenai, Berlios, GitHub, etc. Instead of\nmoving the entire project, some key components such as the\nissues.hudson-ci.org are moved off of\nJava.net. Discussions about moving source code off of Java.net and onto other hosts like\nGitHub come up almost every four months on the mailing lists, typically\ncoinciding with serious Java.net downtime or reliability issues..\n\n2010.11.01 : A discussion occurs on the developers mailing list about\nadding Winston Prakash, the Oracle engineer re-assigned to replace Kohsuke Kawaguchi (Hudson\nfounder/lead developer), as a co-owner to the Java.net project. Winston\nmentions that his question was driven by Oracle management who felt he should\n\"co-own the project.\" After a round of discussion, it’s decided by the devs\nlist that it’s acceptable and grants Winston co-ownership of the project as a\nsign of good faith from the community towards Oracle.\n\n2010.11.17 : Andrew Bayer, core contributor\nand maintainer of numerous plugins emails the users and devs list with a\nproposal to move the mailing lists off of Java.net which has had notorious\nreliability issues within the Java ecosystem and was scheduled for a series of\ndowntimes and migrations over the coming weeks. Google Groups is selected as the\nmost reasonable by the community.\n\n2010.11.19 : Hudson project is lumped into the same Java.net migration bucket as Glassfish. Emails are sent to project owners, the users and the developers list. The mail to users and developers never arrives due to the sender not being subscribed. Both project owners (Kohsuke, Winston) miss the message, leaving the Hudson community in the dark regarding the pending migration.\n\n2010.11.22 : Shortly after midnight, Jacob Robertson reports that his\nSVN credentials no longer work, Kohsuke informs the developers list that the project is\nlocked due to the migration, SVN is inaccessible and mailing lists fail shortly after that. The Hudson Java.net project\nbegins its migration from the legacy infrastructure to the newer\nJava.net infrastructure (formerly known as \"Kenai\"). A group of core Hudson\ncommunity members accelerate the move to Google Groups, pushing out\nannouncements via this\nblog and\ntwitter hoping to keep as many members in the\nloop as possible.\n\n2010.11.23 : Frustrated by the locking down of Hudson’s source code,\nwhich sees between 3-8 commits to \"core\" a day, not counting the 300+\nplugins, Kohsuke proposes moving to\nGitHub\non the new developers mailing list. The general consensus amongst the plugin\nand core developers was to go forward with moving to GitHub, no major\nobjections were raised by the developer community.\n\n2010.11.27 : After Thanksgiving, Andrew Bayer submits the \" formal\nproposal\"\nfor migrating over to GitHub, Sets a deadline of the following tuesday\n(2010.11.30) for raising any major objections before \"flipping the switch.\"\n\nThe Monday morning prior to the planned switchover to GitHub, Oracle Senior VP\nof Tools and Middleware Ted\nFarrell sent a\nmessage to the users list expressing concerns he had regarding the migration of\nthe Hudson codebase from Java.net to GitHub:\n\nOracle’s goal is to grow the community and make hudson stronger. You all might not be aware of this, but the actual hudson user base is very large. Much bigger than what you see on the mailing lists or in the forums. The unfortunate part of that is how many of these users do not contribute to the core, and do not participate in these discussions. They want to do that, but don’t feel like they can be heard. We want them to be heard. We need to make the hudson community a place that will welcome all the hudson users and encourage its growth and longevity. We will be announcing some changes in the upcoming weeks that we believe will foster that.\n\nFor now, however, we are going to stay on the java.net\ninfrastructure.  We believe it is important for hudson to stay\nconnected with the rest of the the java community, as well as take\nadvantage of some of the cool changes we will have coming to\njava.net.  Moving to GIT can be done while staying on java.net.  It is\nnot a requirement to move to github.\n\n…​\n\nBecause it is open source, we can’t stop anybody from forking it.  We\ndo however own the trademark to the name so you cannot use the name\noutside of the core community.  We acquired that as part of Sun.  We\nhope that everyone working on hudson today will do as they claim to\nwant, and work with us to make hudson stronger.\n\n(Ted’s message was rather long, you can read the whole\npost here)\n\nAs one might expect, Ted’s response to the thread was received with\nmixed responses ranging from general confusion to obvious frustration.\n\nLong time contributor to Hudson’s Git plugin, Nigel Magnay tried to clarify the benefits of migrating to GitHub instead of using Git on the \"new\" Java.net as succinctly as possible:\n\nJust having git support != git support on github. They work full time on providing the best community development tools; I doubt kenai could even catch up, let alone surpass what they’re doing.\n\n…​\n\nI’m confused.\n\nWhat things are you saying you will not let the Hudson developer community\ndo?\n\nI.E: Are you saying that, as the holders of the Hudson 'name', you are\nprohibiting the developer community from choosing (for ourselves) to migrate\nthe infrastructure (bug tracking / wiki)? The repositories ?\n\nSo far the response from the developers has been pretty strongly in favour\nof the migration to google groups for mail, to github for code repositories\nand collaboration, and to a self-hosted site for bug tracking and\ninformation.\n\nTed’s response to Nigel contained one of the most important nugget of\ninformation for the whole discussion nestled in the middle of the message :\n\nNigel, what I am saying is that I believe the _final decision of what to do w.r.t. infrastructure belongs to Oracle and that decision should be made according to the will of the community as it makes sense_\n\nThe part where I editorialize\n\nI readily admit, there is a lot of information to take in here, for clarification there are two distinct \"communities\" involved in Hudson:\n\ndevelopers : the hundreds of developers actively communicating on the\ndevelopers list and\ncontributing to the 300+ plugins\n\nusers : tens of thousands of individuals and companies using Hudson\neither as a straight.war file, or using the native packages provided by\nthe community\n\nThe fundamental issue here is that the developers want to make a change in\nhow they contribute to Hudson, and have made their voices heard to that end.\nFrom the users' perspective, such a change would have literally zero impact\non them, which makes Oracle’s conflation of the two sides of Hudson\nparticularly frustrating.\n\nPart of the impasse between Oracle management and the developer community lies\nin an inherent meritocracy in any large open source project, whether it be the\nLinux kernel, the Python language and runtime, or the PostgreSQL database\nserver, those that contribute carry more weight within the community\nbecause they are actively pushing things forward. On top of that, Oracle\ncontinues to cite a \"larger community\" that’s apparently larger than those\nactive committing to Hudson on a daily or weekly basis, without naming names or\nciting specific contributions.\n\nTed, and in turn, Oracle’s approach to the Hudson community seems to stem from\na systematic misunderstanding of how most (if not all) major open source\nprojects operate. Mentiong closed-door meetings between Sonatype and Oracle\nregarding \"how to make Hudson better\" do nothing to aid many developers'\nconcerns about Oracle’s commitment to Hudson as an open source project or a\ncommunity.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we are being told one thing while Oracle’s actions speak\nto another. Insisting that Hudson development remain on Java.net, after the\ndevelopment community committed to GitHub, contradicts the words promising to\nwork with the Hudson community and to help facilitate its growth. Asserting\nthat Oracle isn’t trying to exert unwelcome control over the project, while\ndoing exactly that.\n\nPersonally, I do want Oracle to continue to be involved, along with CloudBees,\nSonatype and many other companies that contribute to the ever-growing Hudson\necosystem. The involvement of a plethora of different companies only helps\nemphasize the importance of Hudson to the developer community and underline the\nvalue of Hudson as a community owned and operated project.\n\nDecember will be an interesting month, stay tuned.","title":"Who's driving this thing?","tags":["general","core","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

The login for the systems is somewhat tied to Java.net so I am honestly not sure how stable they will be this week.\n\nI apologize sincerely for the confusion and frustration, you can trust that we’re likely ten-times more frustrated with this situation right now.\n---","title":"New Hudson Mailing Lists!","tags":["general","mailing list","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Unlike Kohsuke’s presentation, John spent a lot of time in demos which made live-blogging a bit difficult. image:https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4129/5012383102_cf258075a6.jpg\n\nJohn takes the stage at 9:30, this presentation is totally different from yesterday’s presentation from Kohsuke\n\nTaking Hudson a little further, beyond just scheduling a build job.\n\nWho is not using Hudson, less than 10% raise hands.\n\nFocusing on the more technical/nitty-gritty things with Hudson. Looking at:\n\nCI Basics\n\nNotification strategies\n\nQuality metrics\n\nBuild promotions\n\nAutomated deployment\nWho knows what build promotions? Who uses build promotions? Very few in the audience use build promotions.\n\nWho uses Hudson for automated deployment, a handful raise their hands. Plenty of Tomcat and JBOSS users automating deployment. John going to use Tomcat for the automated deployment demo in this presentation.\n\nJohn mentions he’s authoring the \"Continuous Integration with Hudson\" book, which will be available for download as it comes out.\n\nLet’s talk about Continuous Integration! Summing up what CI is in three words: feedback, visibility and delivery. CI is about snappy feedback. You want feedback in minutes.\n\nVisibility should be associated with continuous integration, getting everybody in the product life cycle into the loop with continuous integration (product people, QA, developers, etc).\n\nWhat makes Hudson so great? (according to John)\n\nEasy to use\n\nPlenty of plugins/the ecosystem around Hudson for extending/integrating Hudson\n\nReporting/coverage features\n\nDistributed builds\n\nFirst demo, the Hudson dashboard (starring the Nested View plugin). Starting with a basic dashboard filled with some unstable and stable builds. Cloudy builds thanks to Cobertura coverage grading.\n\nUsing the Nested View plugin to group views to make the dashboard more useflu for a ton of jobs.\n\nCovering build radiators, not enough of the audience uses radiators. John advocates commandeering big monitors for radiators as part of your \"notification strategy\"\n\nCovering the basic version control integration, John highly recommneds using a \"Repository Browser\". \"The point is, you want one\" John starts improvising with making some changes, pops over to Eclipse and refactors some code, commits and kicks off a build. Navigates to the source changes for the newly broken build in \"Sventon\", his repository browser of choice which was connected to the job\n\nJohn shows the job using Maven integration and deploying artifacts to the Maven repository he’s set up on his local machine.\n\nHudson will automatically keep track of jar files/war files, so enable the \"Discard Old Builds\" checkbox to prevent Hudson from eating all kinds of disk space. Useful to only discard the artifacts for the last X builds instead of the test results/code coverage.\n\nDesktop build notifiers are quite useful, email can tend to get clutter/lost in the mess with everything else coming into your inbox.\n\nTest results integration\n\nGoing into the test results dashboard per-build and the test-result and build time trends for a specific job.\n\nWhy is the build time trend useful? If the build suddenly takes a huge amount of time to run, you’ve likely got performance issues that need fixing.\n\nPublishing HTML reports\n\nStarring the HTML Publisher plugin! Using the plugin to publish HTML reports generated from easyb for publishing acceptance test results for more wide-spread consumption.\n\nBouncing from HTML reports to integrating with Sonar for code quality metrics\n\nBuild Promotion\n\nStarring the Promoted Builds plugin! Covering some similar concepts to Kohsuke’s talk yesterday but literally going into the Hudson configuration and setting it up.\n\nTime is running out, John’s flipping back and forth between the M2 release plugin and his automatic deployment to his local Tomcat environment.\n\nQ&A\n\"Can Hudson be used for other environments\". Yes! Supports a number of build plugins, MSBuild, NAnt, CMake, in addition to the freestyle build. \"Maven 3 support\" Sonatype is apparently working on an integrated version of Hudson with Maven 3, Hudson core planning support \"eventually.\"","title":"Live Blog: John Smart demos advanced Hudson usage","tags":["general","javaone"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
