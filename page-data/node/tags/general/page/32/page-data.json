In fact, this is often considered central to the practice of continuous integration.\n\nThere are two ways to achieve this. One is the \"pull\" model, where Hudson periodically reaches out to a Subversion repository to see if there is any changes. The other is the \"push\" model, where you make the Subversion repository reach out to Hudson.\n\nBoth approaches have trade-offs. The pull model is easier to configure, since you can do this entirely from Hudson. But this comes at the expense of increased load to the Subversion server. Even though the overhead of Subversion polling is relatively low, as you add more projects to Hudson and increase the polling frequency, the overhead may get non-trivial (imagine the number of Hudson pollings that the poor java.net Subversion server gets, for example.) A more serious downside, in my opinion, is that this increases the delay from your commit to a build. For example, if your build just takes 5 mins, then even if you poll every minute, you pay on average 30 seconds delay before a build starts — a 10% overhead!\n\nThe push approach eliminates those two downsides, but it requires a post-commit hook configuration in the Subversion repository, which has to be done manually by the administrator, because those scripts are not exposed to external systems like Hudson.\n\nWith that said, if you do have an access to the Subversion repository post-commit hook, I highly recommend the push approach, and in Hudson we made it as easy as possible to configure the set up. Here’s the script you’ll need in your post-commit hook:\n\nREPOS=\"$1\" REV=\"$2\" UUID=\\`svnlook uuid $REPOS\\` /usr/bin/wget \\\n       --header \"Content-Type:text/plain;charset=UTF-8\" \\\n       --post-data \"\\`svnlook changed --revision $REV $REPOS\\`\" \\\n       --output-document \"-\" \\\n       https://server/hudson/subversion/${UUID}/notifyCommit?rev=$REV\n\nThis script basically just tells Hudson that there was a change in a repository. Hudson will then check this information against all the jobs that have a polling configured, and schedule the builds accordingly. The beauty of this approach is two-folds:\n\nThe script doesn’t change when you add/remove/rename jobs.\n\nThe overhead is constant regardless of the number of jobs.\n\nIf you haven’t configured a push setup yet, now is the time to do so!","title":"Subversion repository change notification: push vs pull","tags":["general","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ba641f0e-00e7-583a-ae6c-7b96cc13d8f6","slug":"/blog/2010/06/09/welcome-to-hudson-labs/","strippedHtml":"Hello again! It’s been a long time since I’ve written for the Hudson community, but now I’m back and ready to tackle some of the latest developments in the Hudson community.\n\nWhat is Hudson Labs?\n\nAs you may have read in April, Kohsuke left Oracle to found InfraDNA, a company specializing around Hudson. The departure meant the Hudson community would no longer have access to some of the hardware and services that Kohsuke had accumulated over the years working on Hudson at Sun Microsystems. While we are still happily part of the Java.net community, we’ve recognized the need for some community-owned resources and Hudson Labs was born.\n\nOver the past couple months, a group within the Hudson community, \"infra\" (short for \"infrastructure\"), has been working to get machines set up and build the foundation for a more open Hudson project infrastructure.\n\nWhat does Hudson Labs provide?\nBuilds\n\nOne of the first tasks we set upon when building out Hudson Labs was to start improving the build and release process of Hudson by moving as much of it into a public Hudson instance. Building Hudson itself, plugins and dependencies of the Hudson project, the Hudson Labs instance will help improve the reliability of the Hudson ecosystem across the board, and should serve as a useful tool for core and plugin developers.\n\nMirroring\n\nThanks to the great team over at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab ( OSUOSL), we’ve been able to build out mirroring infrastructure for Hudson to provide fast access to native packages and wars alike. Currently the OSUOSL only has mirrors inside the continental United States, so we’re reaching out to friends in Asia and Europe to extend the mirroring system.\n\nInformation\n\nI’m currently working on re-working some of the blog posts you may have read over four months as more structured tutorials. I hope to provide an easily accessible knowledge-base for developing Hudson along with configuring Hudson for various platforms and development environments; this is a more difficult task so all the pieces aren’t entirely in place for this just yet.\n\nTo be honest, I’m very enthusiastic about Hudson’s future. Now that InfraDNA is up and running, Kohsuke’s renewed focus combined with the foundation of Hudson Labs and the uncommonly hospitable Hudson developer and user communities, the future is looking bright!","title":"Welcome to Hudson Labs!","tags":["general","meta","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Hyperic builds enterprise systems monitoring and management software and also contributes to a number of open source projects, many of which are built with Hudson.\n\nTo date I must say that Doug’s use of Hudson is one of the largest and more impressive installations I’ve seen. I don’t want to spoil the interview, but they’re testing on platforms that don’t even run Java. Madness! If you think you can out-do him, you can find my email information at the bottom of the interview, I’d love to hear about it!\n\nWithout further ado, Doug from SpringSource.\n\nDoug We started using Hudson in early 2008 to automate the build and testing of our SIGAR library.  The SIGAR API implements a portable interface in C for gathering system information related to memory, processors, file systems, network interfaces, network connection tables, the process table and more.  We support dozens of OS + version + architecture combinations, along with several language bindings.  SIGAR is a key component of the Hyperic HQ agent and is used in other projects including Hypertable, Terracotta, GridGain and MySQL enterprise.\n\nHudson Was SpringSource using continuous integration before Hudson? If so, what caused you guys to switch?\n\nDoug The SIGAR project actually started back in late 2002 and our initial CI system for the project was a good old-fashioned Perl script / ssh for-loop.  It was good enough to get by in the early years, but a proper replacement was long overdue.  We were (and still are) using Bamboo to build and test Hyperic HQ.  We looked at using Bamboo for SIGAR, but at the time the \"Remote Agent\" feature was new to Bamboo and was not in the version we were running. Rather than disrupt HQ’s CI along with taking on an additional licensing cost, we gave Hudson a shot and haven’t looked back.\n\nHudson Might be a bit of personal bias, but I think you guys made the right choice there! Checking out the public Hudson server, I see that SpringSource is building/testing products on AIX, the BSDs, various flavors of Linux, Solaris, Windows and Mac OS X, what kinds of languages/build systems are being built by Hudson? How varied are the environments that Hudson executes jobs in?\n\nDoug And HP-UX! The matrix of SIGAR’s supported OS + kernel version + architecture + distribution is north of 100 combinations.  So, Hudson is covering a very heterogeneous collection of systems with most jobs tied to a specific node.  Our primary focus has been the C API and Java JNI bindings, using an Ant based build system and a JUnit test suite.  SIGAR also has language bindings for Perl, Ruby, Python, Erlang, PHP, C# and Lua.  So, Hudson is also driving each language’s extension build system of choice, respectively: MakeMaker, Rake, distutils, emake, phpize, Nant and autotools.\n\nHudson What do you consider to be noteworthy about your Hudson implementation? Besides, clearly, that you’re running Hudson agents on just about every OS that will run Java :)\n\nDoug The majority of our x86/x64 nodes are virtualized on VMware ESX and VMware Server.  We also have a fine collection of PPC, PA-RISC and Sparc hardware in house, with IA-64 and s390x hosted elsewhere by third parties.  Some of these systems are too old to support Java 1.5 and/or Git.  As a simple work-around, the nodes share an NFS workspace where the agent node takes care of 'SCM' and 'Post-build Actions', but the 'Build' step in between is invoked via ssh. The SIGAR distribution includes about two dozen native binaries that are compatible with most of the supported platform matrix.  There’s a Hudson job for each Git branch that rolls these binaries into a release bundle. Another job flavor uses the Hudson URL SCM plugin to download and unit test the binary releases on the rest of the platform matrix.  This is key to testing binary compatibility.  Similar for the collectd project, each Git branch has a job that runs automake, autoconf, etc. and 'make dist' into the collectd release flavor tarball.  So a push to git.verplant.org by octo in Germany triggers an update of the collectd release artifact, which in turn triggers the URL SCM jobs to download the tarball, unpack and build over here at our west coast locations. We have four Hudson servers in different locations, three of which are managing most of the jobs behind firewalls.  Select jobs use the Build Publisher plugin to post the job and its artifacts to our public Hudson server. This makes it easy for us to provide platform specific bug fixes in binary form, share build logs with external projects and host a central repository of artifacts reachable by all of the URL SCM based jobs. Our public Hudson server also provides CI for the HQApi project and jobs to build HQ plugins, again making it easier to distribute patch fixes in binary form between releases.\n\nHudson I’ve very impressed! I’m glad the fact that Java won’t run on some of the platforms you want to support hasn’t stopped you from testing anyways. Clearly you folks have written some addition tools behind the scenes, mind discussing them a bit?\n\nDoug Other than some Hudson plugin tweaks and additions, the Perl script I mentioned earlier was converted to generate the majority of our Hudson jobs and includes a simple templating system.  The same script generates jobs to build collectd and a few other projects.  We’ve outgrown this flavor of the script and have started working on integrating Opscode Chef to automate our Hudson configration along with the systems we build and test on. And of course, we’re using Hyperic HQ to monitor our Hudson server instances, agent and node machines.\n\nHudson But of course, I’d say dog-fooding is an important part of any continuous testing set up. It appears that SpringSource has bought in pretty deeply to a Hudson-oriented workflow, given the amount of time and resources you all have invested in getting the massive farm set up that you have. That said, on a scale from 1-10, how important would you rate Hudson to your day-to-day workflow?\n\nDoug I’d say at least an 8, although my daily workflow doesn’t always directly involve Hudson.  Most of those points go to Hudson for automating what otherwise would be interrupting my workflow on a daily basis.\n\nI'd like to thank Doug again for giving us a peek behind the curtains at SpringSource and how they're using Hudson.

This being our second \"spotlight\" on a particular company, the format can still be considered beta; if you have any additional questions for Rasheed, feel free to ask them in the comments and I’ll try to get Rasheed to answer.\n\nSimilar to the spotlight on ITA Software from last week, VisFleet builds business software helping their customers operate their businesses more effectively through web applications in tandem with mobile applications. While I could endlessly discuss the power and flexibility of Hudson, particularly for building web software, I’ll let Rasheed do the majority of the talking, so let’s get to it.\nintroducing VisFleet, would you mind explaining a bit more of what you guys do and some of the challenges it presents?\n\nRasheed It’s a pleasure. VisFleet has changed it’s direction somewhat, moving from\nservices into product development. As we move into product, we want to be\nresponsive to our customers. Agile development is becoming core to how we\noperate, and as such, continuous builds and integration became a major\nfactor. We now plan to offer two products for work planning and and vehicle\ntracking. We want to present these systems with a SaaS model. The world of\nonline, pay as you go software, has a culture of frequent improvements and\nresponsiveness to user feedback. If we want to do well in this space, it’s\nimportant that we can code, test, release and feed back in\ntight iterations.\n\nHudson How long has VisFleet been using Hudson?\n\nRasheed About 14 months now.\n\nHudson Did you guys work with continuous integration prior to starting to use\nHudson? If so, what system was VisFleet using and what compelled the switch\nto\nHudson?\n\nRasheed We didn’t actually, but certainly everyone I knew who was doing continuous\nintegration recommended Hudson.\n\nHudson That’s good to hear! How lucky you are to know so many smart people :)\nWhat kinds of projects is VisFleet building with Hudson?\n\nRasheed We build and test Ruby On Rails service layer applications. We also build Flex applications using the Flex SDK for our web-deployed RIA offering. Lastly, we build our iPhone applications using Hudson.\n\nHudson I’d say building and testing web applications alone with Hudson would be quite notable, but to add Flex and iPhone applications into the mix as well is certainly interesting! Anything specific that’s interesting about VisFleet’s use of Hudson?\n\nRasheed It runs multiple agent types, and automates deploys to different cloud\ninfrastructures. At the moment we have 2 Flex build agents running Ubuntu, A\nMac Mini building our iPhone app, and several Ubuntu Servers testing our web\ntier. We currently deploy to Citrix Xen servers, and soon to Rackspace Cloud as well.\n\nIn the near future, we will automate integration by first updating an\nintegration system on the cloud, deploying our system and then running our\ntests. All very quickly.\n\nWe have very little metric and reporting output from Hudson, and this is\nnoteworthy in it’s absence. It’s very important  to use to provide clear\ndevelopment metrics and integrate those into our Scrum / Kanban approach. What\nHudson has done for us is educate us about the possibilities in\nvisualisation and reporting, and is informing the way we structure our\ncodebase going forward. Soon, we expect to have a premium test driven\ndevelopment environment and workflow.\n\nHudson We all know Hudson isn’t perfect but there’s a lot of room for extending it to meet your demands if need be, what additional tools have you written to glue everything together behind\nthe scenes?\n\nRasheed We are using ' Vlad the Deployer ' and in legacy, ' Capistrano ' for a lot of\nour deployment and build tasks. These are merely infrastructure specific\nscripts to ensure we can bring up live environments in the shortest amount\nof time possible.\n\nHudson So it sounds like you guys are all on board with Hudson, on a 1-10 scale, how important would you rate Hudson’s importance to VisFleet’s workflow?\n\nRasheed 7, aiming at 10. The missing points are just a matter of time :)\n\nThanks again to Rasheed for chatting with me about how Hudson helps VisFleet keep cranking on what they do best.

Specifically how  I use Hudson to create release versions of my apps.\n\nDebug vs Release\n\nI’m assuming that you are using Eclipse with the ADT plugin. During development you can test your app on the emulator or a device and resources like R.java and aidl files are compiled for you automatically by the plugin. When it’s time to release your app, you’ll need to go through some steps:\n\nYou must sign your app using a certificate\n\nYou must update your AndroidManifest.xml to remove the android:debuggable attribute\n\nReplace your Google Maps API debug key with the one belonging to your release certificate (if you are using a MapView)\n\nGenerate an apk package for the release and test it on a device or emulator\n\nIt would be nice to automate a few of these steps, and this is where Hudson comes in.\n\nAutomated builds: Ant\n\nFor automated builds the Android SDK uses Apache Ant, which Hudson has great support for. To generate a template build.xml you can use the android tool from the SDK using the following command:\n\nandroid create project -n template -t android-7 -p template -k dummy.pkg -a Dummy\n\nThe target is specified as \"android-7\" meaning that we are building for Android 2.1. For apps that use MapView we would use \"Google Inc.:Google APIs:7\". It is a good idea to always target the latest SDK. From this template project we’ll grab the build.properties and the build.xml and copy those to the Android project that we want to build. Edit build.xml and set the project name to your Android project name.\n\nThe local.properties file contains the path to the SDK root and shouldn’t be checked in to version control. For our use we’ll set the properties that are in that file on the Hudson job configuration page.\n\nRunning the build in Hudson\n\nThis part is easy: create a new freestyle job and let it be build with ant. The targets that we want to execute are clean release. Release will compile, package and sign your apk. Now to get this working right, some custom properties should be set (use the Advanced button).\n\nsdk.dir=/Users/hugo/Code/android-sdk-mac\ntarget=Google Inc.:Google APIs:7\nkey.store=certs/rd-release.keystore\nkey.alias=rainydays\nkey.store.password=thisisnotmypassword\nkey.alias.password=thisisnotmypassword\n\nThe sdk.dir should point to the Android SDK root on your Hudson node. In my case I’m running Hudson locally on my machine.  The target property refers to the SDK we want to use as mentioned earlier.  The key. properties are related to signing of the apk. My strategy is to have a separate key store and private key for each application that I develop. I also check that keystore in to SVN. I also archive the -release.apk artifact so that I can download the latest release apk directly from Hudson.  After completing these steps, you should be able to build your Android app with Hudson.\n\nUpdating the AndroidManifest for release\n\n…​But we’re not done yet :) Remember what I said about updating the AndroidManifest.xml? For that we need to edit the build.xml, which by default contains nothing more then a tag to pull in the Android SDK ant target definitions. For my Rainy Days application, I adjusted build.xml like this:\n\n...\n\nRemoving debug attribute from AndroidManifest.xml\n\nSetting release maps key\n\nWhat the above snippet does is removing the android:debuggable attribute from the AndroidManifest.xml and replacing the maps API key in res/layout/maplayout.xml with the correct key for release. The -package-resources target is pulled in from the Android android_rules.xml file.\n\nNow when Hudson builds my app I get a ready to release apk that I can install on my device or emulator, which is pretty nice.\n\nThere is are some issues with this approach however. As you might have noticed:\n\nReplacements are done in the workspace, we are not really building exactly what’s in svn\n\nEach new build should start out fresh for that reason, for example by using the svn revert option.\n\nAdditionally I can not yet tag the release version with the updated files, because the subversion tagging plugin doesn’t support this by design. This could be worked around by adding svn statements in the build.xml however.  For now I don’t really mind as I make minor changes to the resource files, but I’ll be looking at improving this situation.\n\nThings to add: unit testing, coverage…​\n\nOne thing that I’d really like to add is unit testing. This is a little bit more complicated though, since unit tests require a running emulator and a running emulator requires a gui. The Hudson Xvnc plugin could be very helpful here.\n\nThe Android build scripts for test projects already include EMMA output, it shouldn’t be to hard to use the Hudson plugin for that.\n\nWhen Hudson is running on a local machine, the Batch task plugin can automate installing the apk on a device to automate things further.\n\nSummary\n\nBuilding Android applications with Hudson is not that hard, since the builds are based on Ant. By hooking in to the standard Android build targets it’s easy to update files like AndroidManifest.xml which in turn makes sure the release process is controlled and predictable.\nAndroid unit tests depend on the emulator which is a little bit more challenging to set up, but Hudson already has some plugins available to make this easier.\n\nEditor’s Note: Hugo Visser is the developer of Rainy Days and Engine Watch for Android.
