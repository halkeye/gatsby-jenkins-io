Moving to Jenkins about 5 years ago bitExpert gained a lot of experience in running and managing a distributed Jenkins infrastructure. bitExpert builds custom applications for our clients which means that we have to deal with different project infrastructures, e.g. different PHP versions. We heavily rely on the build nodes concept of Jenkins which I will briefly outline in the session. Besides that I will give some in-depth insights on how we use Jenkins on a daily basis for the \"traditional\" CI related tasks (e.g. linting code, checking code style, running tests) as well as how Jenkins is used to power our integration tests. Last but not least I will cover how Jenkins acts as a kind of backbone for our Satis server which allows us to host the metadata of our company’s private Composer packages. Throughout the talk I will point out which Jenkins plugins we use in the different contexts to give you a good starting point if you are new in the Jenkins ecosystem.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/bitExpert-logo_0.png[image,width=220,height=76] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Stephan Hochdoerfer, Head of Technology at bitExpert AG.

Those products are themselves used to develop end user projects. Maintenance and support are needed at each level of delivery and we use branches for this. This creates hundreds of combinations.\n\n+\n+\n\nNow, for each product or project version (or branch), we have a delivery pipeline. We start by compiling, testing, packaging, publishing. Then we deploy the application on the different supported platforms and go through different levels of validation, until we’re ready for delivery. Aside from a few details and configuration elements, most of the pipelines are identical from one branch to the other, from one project to the other.\n\n+\n+\n\nSo, one framework, some products, several projects, maintenance branches, complex pipelines… We end up having many many jobs to create, duplicate and maintain. Before even going into this direction, we saw this as a blocking issue - there was no way we could maintain manually thousands of jobs on a day to day basis.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe solution we were looking for should have the following characteristics:\n\n+\n+\n\nSelf service - our goal being to delegate the job and branch administration in Jenkins to the projects, in order to reduce the support time\n\nSecurity - we didn’t want to open Jenkins to the projects at configuration level - not acceptable in our context\n\nSimplicity - the solution should be simple enough to be manageable by people not knowledgeable about the core technologies of Jenkins\n\nExtensibility - the solution must be flexible enough to allow extensions when needed\n\n+\n+\n\nWhen we thought about using the Job DSL plug-in, delegating the creation of the pipeline to the project teams was OK from a self service point of view, but was not secure and definitely not simple for people not knowing Jenkins.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn the end, we opted for a solution where:\n\n+\n+\n\nA project team would edit a simple property file listing the characteristics of the current branch, like which type of platform is supported, which version of the pipeline library to use, etc.\n\nUpon commit of this shopping list, the complete branch pipeline is regenerated using the given version of the pipeline library\n\nThe pipeline library code reads the “shopping list” property file and runs a Job DSL script to generate the branch pipeline according to those parameters\n\n+\n+\n\nBy default, the pipeline library generates a classic pipeline, suitable for most needs. It is also possible to define and use extensions, like having additional jobs in the pipelines.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn case of new features or defects, we develop or branch a new version of the pipeline library and projects or branches can use it by changing the version of their shopping list file.\n\n+\n+\n\nA project gets injected into the system by having only a project seed being generated. From it, the authorised members can generate the branch seed and any branch pipeline at any time. Those seed jobs and the pipelines themselves can also be driven directly from the SCM using our plugin.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe project teams are now autonomous and can pilot their pipelines without requesting any support. They act in a secure and isolated way, and cannot compromise the shared environment. The “shopping list” file is simple and well documented. The system is not rigid and allows for extensions.\n\n+\n+\n\nThis platform has been developed initially for a very specific framework and a set of projects which depend on it, but has been extended since to be able to support other stacks. It is structured in two different parts:\n\n+\n+\n\nThe seed platform itself - generation of branch structures in Jenkins and trigger end points for being piloted from the SCM\n\nThe pipeline libraries, referenced from the shopping list files\n\n+\n+\n\nWe still allow some small tools and applications to define directly their pipeline by providing a Job DSL script.\n\n+\n+\n\nUsing the same principle, we can also pilot other tools in the ecosystem - like Artifactory or Ontrack.\n\n+\n+\n\nI’ll talk about this seed platform on June 24th, in the Jenkins User Conference in London.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/dcoraboeuf_0.preview.jpg[image,width=150] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Damien Coraboeuf, Continuous Delivery Expert at Clear2Pay.

This will be my third presentation at a JUC and fourth time to attend, but my first on the East Coast. I have learned about a lot of cool stuff in the past, which is why I started presenting, to tell people about the cool stuff we are doing at Drilling Info. One of the cooler things we have implemented in the last year is Chat Ops and our bot Sparky. It started as something neat to play with (\"Oooo lots of kittens\") but quickly turned into something more serious.\n\n+\n+\n\nEver get asked the same questions over and over? What jobs to run to deploy your code? What is the status of the build? These question and more can all be automated so you do not have to keep answering them. Furthermore, when you do get asked you can show them, and everyone else, how to get the information by issuing the proper commands in a chat room for everyone to see. With chat rooms functioning as the 21st century water coolers, putting the information in the middle of the conversation is a powerful teaching technique. You are not sending people to some out dated documentation on how to get their code deployed, nor are you showing them the steps today only to be forgotten tomorrow. Instead you can deploy your code and they see the exact steps needed to get their code deployed.\n\n+\n+\n\nEven more impressive is the way ChatOps can bring your company together. Recently our CTO got a hipchat account so he could interact with Sparky. This gave me the idea that if we extend Sparky to deliver information useful to the other teams (Sales, Marketing, Finance, etc) then we would be able to get these wildly disparate teams in the same chat room together and hopefully they will talk and learn from each other. Where DevOps is the bringing together of Dev and Ops, ChatOps can be the bridge across the entire organization. Come see my presentation Day 1: Track 1 at 4:00 PM to learn how ChatOps can enrich your team, how Drilling Info is using it, and what our future plans entail for ChatOps.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/01-01-1600-soula_0.jpg[image,width=152,height=182] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Will Soula, Senior Configuration Management/Build Engineer at Drilling Info.

I’m looking forward to heading to JUC East in a couple weeks, which runs June 18-19. The Jenkins User Conference is the annual get-together for Jenkins customers, users, partners, developers and community members. It promises to be an exciting two days, and as an added bonus I get to catch up with Kohsuke Kawaguchi and Gene Kim!\n\n+\n+\n\nI will be giving a talk about a topic that I think is a bit of an elephant in the room in the Continuous Delivery space: the critical importance of optimized Automated Testing. As you start to ship code faster, you’ll need numerous automated tests across many different tools, in many different jobs in your pipeline. But getting a grip on the results of all of your automated tests — and then figuring out whether your software is good enough to go live — becomes harder and harder as you speed up the delivery of your software.\n\n+\n+\n\nI’ll share tips on how naming conventions, partitioning of testware and mirroring the application’s structure in the test code help you best handle automated testing with Jenkins. I’ll also try to provide some insight into how to keep the setup manageable, as well as share practical experiences of managing large portfolios of automated tests. Finally, we’ll showcase some practices that help you manage all your test results and add aggregation, trend analysis and qualification capabilities to your Jenkins setup.\n\n+\n+\n\nJoin us at the event, or check the slides or recording (which we’ll post after the talk) to learn more. Looking forward to seeing you there!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/01-01-1130-phillips_0.jpg[image,width=152,height=182] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Andrew Phillips, at XebiaLabs.

I aim to capture some of the lessons that we have learned at Delphix and that I learned while I was in graduate school. At Delphix we have been large users of Jenkins for over four years which is most of the history of our startup. We currently run thousands of jobs per day. We have been quite happy with the experience and expect these numbers to grow significantly as our business scales beyond our current 300 head count.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe core concept of Delphix is Data as a Service. Our software allows businesses to virtualize databases and data associated with their applications then provision these on demand to developers and others who need virtual copies of them. Our development for this software spans the entire stack. We have quite a few kernel developers, including the original team for the ZFS filesystem who work on developing the open source application, OpenZFS, which underpins our product. Further up the stack we have a large java application that interacts with ZFS to perform virtualization operations, provides user\nfacing webservices, and interfaces with our internal Postgres metadata store which stores the state of our system. Finally above this we have a modern Javascript front end for user interaction. Our full software product ships as a virtual machine on a variety of hypervisors. As a result of these numerous components, end to end integration testing is very important to us. This integration testing is the primary use of Jenkins for us. Before any developer checks in code to either our operating system or application repository, it must undergo several hours of automated integration testing. We also have nightly runs which go for far longer and tests a much more extensive set of functionality. In addition, we use Jenkins for the build process of our software as well as final packaging for release. Because Jenkins serves as a hub for our development processes, having a well designed system is very important to us and saves us significant time.\n\n+\n+\n\nBelow are some of the key points I will be discussing at my talk. I hope you attend to learn more about the areas that I find very interesting.\n\n+\n+\n\nI’m planning to discuss the structure of a Jenkins plugin. I’ll also cover a few of the more advanced areas of plugins such as distributed builds that I see less frequently in plugins. In addition, I’ll briefly cover unit testing, which is something missing in many open source plugins.\n\nI’ll talk about some good patterns to use in plugins as well as some areas where a plugin is not a good idea. I’m planning to pull from my own personal experience developing plugins, the experience of other people at Delphix working with Jenkins, and our experience using other open source plugins to talk about what works and what doesn’t.\n\nI’ll give an overview of the current plugin development at Delphix. I’ll cover some of the lessons that we have learned along the way. We have also started to take a \"dogfooding\" approach to some of our development where we use plugins internally to help our test process and open source them since our customers find features used for testing our product to often be useful in their production environments. This has an added bonus of making it easier to justify our development time spent on making these plugins, since they are also features requested by our customers.\n\nI’ll discuss the trade-offs between using an already developed plugin or group of plugins, writing some scripts, and building your own plugin. Being able to figure out when to do which can lead to major time savings as well as a better user experience.\n\n+\n+\n\nI hope you attend. Even if you have no immediate plans to write your own plugins, hopefully you’ll be able to learn about what makes plugins tick and how to better evaluate plugins when picking them for your own projects. Plugins were what originally got me excited about Jenkins and they allowed me to see its true potential as a build and test system. I hope to share some of that inspiration.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/01-01-1400-vilim_0.jpg[image,width=152] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Peter Vilim, Member of Technical Staff at Delphix.

And I’ll present a lightning talk about Continuous Delivery with Jenkins.\n\n+\n+\n\nHere is short overview of what I’d like to talk about there.\n\n+\n+\n\n1. Continuous Build\n\n+\n+\n\nMy starting point was to get to know JenkinsCI. Our developers used JenkinsCI to make the Continuous Build of our software.\nSo, our developing environment was quite Jenkins friendly from the beginning.\n\n+\n+\n\n2. Continuous Deploy\n\n+\n+\n\n--- Virtual Machine ---\n\n+\n+\n\nWe had to have an environment where we could deploy our new build. As we are big fans of Microsoft, we decided to use Azure as our environment to make Continuous Testing.\n\n+\n+\n\nHow do we control it? We use Powershell, which can be executed with JenkinsCI.\n\n+\n+\n\n--- Product Deployment ---\n\n+\n+\n\nHow did we achieve the Continuous Deploy? Actually, my boss, who is DirectSmile’s Yoda developed a very powerful tool called “DirectSmile Installation Service” to enable this.\n\n+\n+\n\nSo we integrated this tool within JenkinsCI, and now Jenkins can deploy DirectSmile products on any target server with just one-button-click!\n\n+\n+\n\n3. Continuous Testing\n\n+\n+\n\nOf course, we use JenkinsCI to make the Continuous Testing.\nHow do we do that?\nWe use Selenium to make and run tests. So we can cover most features and we can execute it at anytime.\n\n+\n+\n\nWe are doing it after every new version build, to obtain Continuous Delivery.\n\n+\n+\n\n4. Continuous Sharing\n\n+\n+\n\nI think it’s important to share all knowledge and experiences I have had with others, especially those whom have just started with Continuous Delivery.\n\n+\n+\n\nDon’t worry, it is probably much easier than you think.\n\n+\n+\n\nAs a part of this practice, I’d like to share all my knowledge and experiences with how easy it is to achieve Continuous Delivery with Jenkins at JUC 2015.\n\n+\n+\n\nI’m really exciting to meet and talk about this there! See you at JUC 2015 in London!\n\n+\n+\n\nAbout Me\n\n+\n+\n\nMy name is Nobuaki Ogawa, from Japan, and I currently work in Berlin, Germany for the software company DirectSmile as a DevOps QA Manager.\n\n+\n+\n\nFrom the very first time I used JenkinsCI, it helped me a lot. Almost all the work I did last year was mainly with Continuous Delivery with Jenkins.\n\n+\n+\n\nFrom Build to Deploy, Test, and even Maintenance and Monitoring, my Jenkins takes care of everything.\n\n+\n+\n\nIt was super easy to achieve Continuous Delivery in the DirectSmile world with the help of JenkinsCI.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/02-03-1530-ogawa_0.jpg[image,width=152,height=182] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Nobuaki Ogawa, DevOps QA Manager at DirectSmile.

Jenkins plays a critical role.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe “digital channel” is an industry buzzword for many companies these days. The digital channel represents a company’s content that is delivered by websites and mobile devices. Companies want the same website to work across any channel in multiple browsers and different operating systems. They also want that same website to work across an explosion of mobile devices. Add the new generation of smart watches showing up and testing is becoming a huge challenge for IT departments. One big issue is there is too much duplication of testing efforts.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn a perfect world, you would create a core set of test automation scripts that work across all digital channels. A client recently requested that my team and I create this perfect-world scenario, and we are doing just that. Jenkins pulls it all together by managing the execution and reporting.\n\n+\n+\n\nJoin me for my talk to learn how I’m using Jenkins, Selenium, TestNG, and Perfecto Mobile to solve the digital channel testing challenges for one client.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/01-02-1030-dang_0.jpg[image,width=149,height=180] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by David Dang, VP of Automation Solutions at Zenergy Technologies.

Over 250 people showed up. It was, to be completely honest, a bit shocking to me - that little project I’d gotten involved with less than three years earlier was big enough, interesting enough, important enough for 250 people to travel from around the world to spend a day talking about it? That’s an amazing feeling, and it was an amazing day. Since then, there’ve been three more JUCs in the Bay Area, three in Israel and two in Europe, with more talks on more Jenkins subjects and an ever-increasing number of attendees. This year, there are another four scheduled - three of them for two days each this time! Find out more about the first two, JUC US East and JUC Europe, below!\n\n+\n+\n\nNot only are there enough worthy talks to merit a full day a few times a year - now there are enough to merit two days! At JUC US East 2015 outside Washington, DC on June 18 and 19, you can see talks on the Workflow plugin for Jenkins, test automation, mobile testing, plugin development, and a few talks on new and fascinating ways people are using Jenkins - even driving big data workflows! And then, just a few days later, on June 23 and 24 in London, there’s JUC Europe 2015, with talks covering things like the fantastic Job DSL plugin, reproducible build environments, Jenkins and Docker together, and my personal favorite, the 2015 edition of my Seven Habits of Highly Effective Jenkins Users talk.\n\n+\n+\n\nWhether you’re interested in the latest innovations in continuous integration and delivery, or you’re a Jenkins plugin developer wanting to learn how to make your plugins more mature and useful, or you’re a Jenkins administrator trying to understand how to provide your users with a great platform for their builds and testing, or even if you’ve just heard about CI/CD and you want to find out more, the Jenkins User Conferences are a great opportunity to see all those things and meet with other Jenkins users and developers. I’m excited to attend my fifth JUC in London, and I hope to see you there!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/smallerme.jpeg[image,width=150,height=188] +\n\n+\n\nThis post is by Andrew Bayer, build and tools architect at Cloudera and longtime Jenkins contributor.
