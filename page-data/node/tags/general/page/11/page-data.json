This has helped us identify and fix build breaks very quickly.\n\nWe have gone even farther by integrating Jenkins, Kyua,\nand Bhyve.\nKyua is a testing framework for infrastructure software.\nBhyve is the native hypervisor that comes with FreeBSD (similar to KVM on Linux).\n\nWe use the Build Flow plugin in this example Build flow to do the following:\n\nBuild the FreeBSD kernel and userland on amd64 whenever someone checks in new code to https://svn.freebsd.org\n\nCreate a bootable FreeBSD disk image with makefs\n\nBoot the image under bhyve\n\nRun these commands inside the bhyve VM:\n\ncd /usr/tests; kyua test; kyua report-junit --output=test-output.xml\n\nShut down the bhyve VM\n\nImports test-output.xml into Jenkins.\n\nProduces a full native test report in Jenkins\n\nThe results of this work were presented at the Bay Area FreeBSD Users Group\nin this presentation in October 2014.\n\nJenkins has been very easy to set up and use under FreeBSD.   We hope that by using\nJenkins to run OS-level unit tests, we will be able to improve the quality of FreeBSD.\nFor further information, please feel free to contact us at freebsd-testing@FreeBSD.org.","title":"FreeBSD project use of Jenkins for OS testing","tags":["general","feedback","guest post"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/kohsuke.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3c6859a9-1166-5f94-931c-b104a18061b1","slug":"/blog/2014/10/20/mobile-app-for-jenkins-user-conference-bay-area/","strippedHtml":"+\nJenkins User Conference in Bay Area is this Thursday, and one of the new things this year is the mobile app. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://doubledutch.me/download/jenkins-user-conference[ +\nimage:https://dl.doubledutch.me/images/downloadiphone.png[image,width=253,height=532] +\n] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThere's an Android version as well as an iPhone version.
