Last week a new version of the Gradle JPI plugin has been released to iron out some issues.\n\nThe Gradle JPI plugin enables a 100% groovy plugin development environment with Groovy as primary programming language, Spock for writing tests and Gradle as build system. Have a look at the Job DSL plugin for an example.\n\nAn existing Maven build can be converted to Gradle by using the build.gradle template from the Gradle JPI plugin’s README. For instance, the POM from the Gradle plugin translates to this build.gradle file:\n\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        mavenCentral()\n        maven {\n            url 'https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/'\n        }\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath 'org.jenkins-ci.tools:gradle-jpi-plugin:0.6.0'\n    }\n}\n\napply plugin: 'jpi'\n\ngroup = 'org.jenkins-ci.plugins'\nversion = '1.25-SNAPSHOT'\n\njenkinsPlugin {\n    coreVersion = '1.480'\n    displayName = 'Jenkins Gradle plugin'\n    url = 'https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gradle+Plugin'\n    gitHubUrl = 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin'\n\n    developers {\n        developer {\n            id 'gbois'\n            name 'Gregory Boissinot'\n            timezone '+1'\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    compile 'org.jenkins-ci.lib:dry-run-lib:0.1'\n}\n\nUsage of the Gradle JPI plugin is similar to working with the Maven HPI plugin. Use gradle jpi to build the plugin file. gradle check runs the tests, gradle install copies the plugin into the local Maven repository, gradle uploadArchives deploys the plugin to the Jenkins Maven repository and gradle server starts a Jenkins development server with the plugin installed.\n\nIt is recommended to use Gradle 1.8 because that is the version used to build and test the Gradle JPI plugin.\n\nFor the next release it is planned to do some maintenance like fixing code style issues and adding tests. After that more issues need to be addressed to bring the plugin on par with the Maven HPI plugin, most notably fixing the test dependencies ( JENKINS-17129) and publishing the plugin’s JAR ( JENKINS-25007). Updating Gradle to 2.x and getting the plugin on the Gradle plugin portal is also on the wishlist.","title":"Gradle-fy your Jenkins Plugin Project","tags":["general","guest post","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"76ef49f5-8629-511f-841c-e0ac514f6300","slug":"/blog/2014/09/25/cve-2014-6271-impact-on-jenkins/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Singapore[ +\nimage:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Singapore_Road_Signs_-_Restrictive_Sign_-_Stop_-_Security_Check.svg/240px-Singapore_Road_Signs_-_Restrictive_Sign_-_Stop_-_Security_Check.svg.png[image] +\n]\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI suspect many of you have been impacted by https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271[CVE-2014-6271] (aka \"shellshock\" bash vulnerability.) We had our share of updates to do for various *.jenkins-ci.org servers. +\n +\n\n+\nJava application servers in general (including one that ships in Jenkins) do not fork off processes like Apache does to serve requests, so the kind of CGI attacks you see on Apache does not apply. We are currently unaware of any vulnerabilities in Jenkins related to CVE-2014-6271, and no plan to issue a patch for that. +\n +\n\n+\nThat said, we did come up with one possible way attackers can exploit vulnerable bash through Jenkins, that you might want to be aware of. +\n +\n\n+\nWhen a build is parameterized, parameters are passed to the processes Jenkins launch as environment variables. So if you have a shell step (which uses `+bash+` by default), and if Eve only has a BUILD permission but not CONFIGURE permission, then Eve can exploit this vulnerability by carefully crafting parameter values, and have the bash runs arbitrary processes on the agent that run the build. +\n +\n\n+\nIn most such scenarios, Eve would have to be an authenticated user on Jenkins. Jenkins also leaves the record of who triggered what build with what parameters, so there's an audit trail. But if your Jenkins fits this description, hopefully this serves as one more reason to update your bash. +\n +\n\n+\nFinally, to get notified of future security advisories from Jenkins, see https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Security+Advisories[this Wiki page].","title":"CVE-2014-6271 impact on Jenkins","tags":["general","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9e4c3d68-4229-57d1-a134-abe463150496","slug":"/blog/2014/09/24/jenkins-in-javaone-2014/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/JavaOne.png[image] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThere'll be several talks that touch Jenkins.
