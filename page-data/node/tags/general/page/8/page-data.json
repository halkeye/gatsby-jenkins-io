In their own words:\n\nKubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions. Using the concepts of \"labels\" and \"pods\", it groups the containers which make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.\n\nKubernetes-related services by Google are the Google Container Engine, a Kubernetes-powered platform for hosting and managing Docker containers, and the Google Container Registry, a private Docker image registry.\n\nSeveral new Jenkins plugins allow you to make use of Kubernetes and these services:\n\nThe Google Cloud Registry Auth Plugin allows users to authenticate with the Google Cloud Registry so they can push/pull images. This allows you to use the Google Cloud Registry with existing Docker-related plugins, like Docker build step plugin or CloudBees Docker Custom Build Environment Plugin.\n\nThe Kubernetes Plugin implements a cloud provider for Jenkins, and can create agents based on Docker images on-demand on your Kubernetes cluster or the Google Cloud Platform.\n\nWatch Kohsuke demoing Jenkins/Kubernetes integration at OSCON earlier this week.\n\nFor a more in-depth look at how you can use Kubernetes with Jenkins, check out these posts on the CloudBees blog by Tracy Kennedy:\n\nOrchestrating deployments with Jenkins Workflow and Kubernetes\n\nOn-demand Jenkins agents with Kubernetes and the Google Container Engine\n\nClustering Jenkins with Kubernetes in the Google Container Engine","title":"Integrating Kubernetes and Jenkins","tags":["general","plugins","video"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and, as security officer, leads the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d17bd5cd-f3ec-583a-89df-90a6e0487eca","slug":"/blog/2015/07/24/juc-u-s-east-slides-and-video-are-now-available-online/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/dc_0.jpg[image,width=200,height=149] +\n\n+\n+\n\nSlides and video from JUC U.S. East are now available online!\n\n+\n+\n\nIf you attended the conference, THANK YOU, and I’m sure you had fun, learned a lot and met many people from the Jenkins community.

I met him at JUC Europe where he showed me the project he was working on: Juseppe. It looked really interesting, so I asked him to write this guest post.\n\nWhen you write your first custom Jenkins plugin for internal use, it’s easy enough to deploy it on one or maybe two Jenkins instances. You can save it on your local drive and upload the HPI file via the Jenkins Plugin Manager as needed. It’s easy to do this for a few releases. But as your experience grows, the number of plugins and their releases grows as well. The plugins directory on your local drive soon looks like a garbage dump, and it’s difficult to find that most recent version of any plugin. And if you have a lot of Jenkins instances coordinating updates of your plugins may cause a lot of pain.\n\nA similar situation is when you contribute a much-needed patch to an existing plugin, but you don’t have the time to wait until your pull request is be merged and a new release is cut. Or you may need to patch a plugin in ways not suitable for distribution, and decide to effectively fork the plugin for use on your Jenkins instances. How are you going to do this?\n\nA solution avoiding the problems from these situations is to set up your own update site to serve your private plugin builds. Juseppe allows you to do this quickly and easily.\n\nWhat is Juseppe?\n\nJuseppe is an acronym for Jenkins Update Site Embedded for Plugin Publishing Easily. Juseppe can help you set up a Jenkins update site in just a few minutes.\n\nFeatures\n\nGenerates signed update-center.json and release-history.json\n\nWorks with HPI files directly (stored in one folder), no need to set up a Maven repository\n\nWatches for changes in the plugin folder and regenerates JSON files when changes are detected\n\nServes generated files and plugin files with built-in Jetty web server\n\nCan be run in a \"generate-only\" mode when you want to use a different web server for these files.\n\nHow can I get Juseppe?\n\nIt ships as a Docker container, or can be built from source. Visit the GitHub project page to learn more. The complete user guide is available in the GitHub project wiki.","title":"Juseppe, a custom update site for Jenkins","tags":["general","guest post"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and, as security officer, leads the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"10658ee5-476b-5fc3-aa1e-ac4d61fb01b5","slug":"/blog/2015/07/09/jenkins-user-event-scandinavia-2015/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/jues_0.png[image,width=270,height=181] +\n\n+\n+\n\nFor the 4th consecutive year the Jenkins CI community is gathering in Scandinavia.

How do you learn more about them, preferably without installing them on your production instance? You click the plugin’s name, which usually links to the plugin’s wiki page, of course!\n\nUnfortunately, it’s possible for plugins to be published without a wiki page, or any other documentation aside from what’s provided in the plugin itself. This is really unfortunate, as users rely on wiki pages and similar documentation to learn more about a plugin before installing or upgrading it, like its features, limitations, or recent changes. Additionally, plugin wiki pages have a special section at the top that provides an automatically generated technical overview of the plugin, such as dependencies to other plugins, the minimum compatible Jenkins version, a list of developers, and links to the source code repository and issue tracker component. Everyone learning about or using a plugin benefits from a plugin wiki page and luckily, almost all plugins have one!\n\nTo ensure that every plugin has at least a basic wiki page with some documentation, we decided to only publish plugins in the Jenkins update center that have and link to a wiki page. To keep the impact to a minimum, we’re implementing this plan in several stages.\n\nThe first stage went live on June 1: All existing plugins that don’t have a (valid) wiki link got a wiki link assigned by the update center (a so-called 'override'), either to an existing wiki page if there was one, or a generic\"This plugin has no documentation\" wiki page otherwise. This ensures that no currently existing plugins get dropped from the update center at this point. Of course, new plugins that don’t provide a wiki URL and don’t have an override URL will not show up at all.\n\nThe second stage will be enabled later this year: We’re planning to remove all the overrides mentioned above. At this point, plugins may get removed from the update center if they still don’t specify a wiki URL. Of course this isn’t our goal, and we’ll try to work with plugin authors to prevent this from happening.\n\nSo what can you do? Check the current overrides list to see whether the plugins you care about are affected, and if so, see the landing page in the wiki to learn what you can do. If you have any questions about this process not covered by the wiki, ask us on the Jenkins developers mailing list.","title":"New Wiki URL Requirement for Plugins","tags":["general","meta","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"daniel-beck","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel is a Jenkins core maintainer and, as security officer, leads the <a href=\"/security/#team\">Jenkins security team</a>.\nHe sometimes contributes to developer documentation and project infrastructure.</p>\n</div>","id":"daniel-beck","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Daniel Beck","slug":"/blog/authors/daniel-beck","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","id":"bb00962d-9ecc-5482-aaa6-1cfbbc15c783","slug":"/blog/2015/06/16/juc-speaker-blog-series-martin-hobson-juc-u-s-east/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/Jenkins_Butler_0.png[image,width=114,height=128] +\n\n+\n+\n\nI’ve been using Jenkins for some time now as the build server for the various projects that are assigned to our four-person software development team, but recently I had exposure to how things were done in a much larger team, and I came away with a better understanding of the kinds of demands that are placed on a build pipeline in these environments. It was quite an education – while the CI pipelines that I administer in our small team might require a handful of virtual machines in our corporate cloud, the pipeline in this team supported over one hundred developers and required several hundred VM instances at any given time.\n\n+\n+\n\nWhen operating at this scale, efficiency does become important, as the Amazon cloud charges add up and become significant at this level. Using some relatively simple techniques, I was able to gain insight into what actually happened in the more complex build jobs and learned just how these VM instances were utilized. These build jobs configured over a dozen virtual machines each, and understanding the startup and execution flows was critical to making changes and improving efficiencies. I will be discussing how to instrument and analyze these complex builds in my Lightning Talk:\"Visualizing VM Provisioning with Jenkins and Google Charts” and hope to see you all there!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/01-02-1615-hobson_0.jpg[image,width=152,height=182] +\n\n+\n+\n\nThis post is by Martin Hobson, Senior Software Developer at Agilex Technologies.
