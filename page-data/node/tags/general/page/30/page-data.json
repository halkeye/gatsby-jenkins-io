This seems to happen mainly for two reasons — people sometimes forget to commit some files, and in the tranquility of waiting for your SCM to finish a commit, people sometimes realize the problems in the commit and they quickly make follow-up changes. The conventional wisdom is that the CI server should wait for the burst to finish before attempting a build. This is said to reduce the chance of having broken build, and it is also sometimes useful in reducing the average turn-around time for builds that take longer.\n\nAs such, Hudson is capable of waiting for a commit burst to be over before it triggers a new build, and this feature is called \"quiet period.\" There are two parts in Hudson that interacts with the quiet period. One is the SCM polling behavior and the other is the queue.\n\nThe queue portion of the quiet period is straight-forward. When a build is scheduled into the queue with quiet period, the build will sit in the queue until the quiet period expires. If during this period, additional attempts are made to put the same build in the queue, the quiet period resets to its initial value. For example, if the quiet period is 5 minutes, and the build is put into the queue 9:00am and 9:03am, the actual build will only happen after 9:08am. Thus another way to think of the quiet period is that you are requiring a certain period of inactivity.\n\nThe above applies to all the mechanisms in Hudson that puts builds into the queue. This includes REST API call, CLI call, downstream triggers, and SCM pollings. So if you implement some kind of a \"push\" mechanism in your SCM to notify Hudson of a new commit, then you get the desired effect by just setting the quiet period in Hudson, and those push scripts don’t have to do anything tricky.\n\nIt is also possible for some of those to override the quiet period configured in the project. For example, when you click \"Build Now\" button in your browser, your browser is making a REST API call, but with the quiet period of zero. I used to run a \"push\" script that looks into a commit message and overrides the quiet period by taking advantages of this feature.\n\nThe other portion of the quiet period that often matters is the SCM polling behaviour. Up until Hudson 1.346, the way Hudson defined the SCM abstraction made it impossible for SCMs to correctly report newly detected commits since the last polling. Instead, it was only possible to report if the repository is newer than the workspace. As a result, if the polling interval is set shorter than the quiet period, the build stayed in the quiet period forever. This was tracked in HUDSON-2180.\n\nHudson 1.346 fixed this issue, and so if you are using a newer version of Hudson and SCM plugins that take advantage of this improvement, then everything works as expected. Otherwise, avoid setting quiet period longer than the polling interval.","title":"Quiet Period Feature","tags":["general","core","tutorial"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","id":"7130159b-70ef-5a1b-8c40-aaefb4a1cd5d","slug":"/blog/2010/08/10/big-security-fix-hudson-1-371-released/","strippedHtml":"Hot on the heels of Hudson 1.370, which was released last Friday, the Hudson team released 1.371 which addresses a critical vulnerability in all Hudson versions prior to 1.371.

Partially thanks to ( Titus Brown)'s PyCon 2010 Atlanta coverage of continuous integration for Python (which we’ve covered before), Hudson has made great strides within the Python community as well. In my experience, the majority of Python developers are not using Hudson to build anything, unless they have C extensions, but rather to test their packages, which presents its own set of specific requirements for jobs. Jobs for testing Python code need to be able to reliaby reproduce an environment with the same set of dependencies from one run to the next in order to provide consistent testing. Unlike their Java counterparts, Python developers cannot rely on a powerful system like Maven2 for enumerating build/test targets or defining their project’s dependencies in their jobs; fortunately, w e can have something close: virtualenv and pip. Virtualenv does exactly what you might expect it to, it creates a \"virtual environment\" with custom site-packages directory, and modified python executable. Using virtualenv you can create a staged environment to use for running unit and integration tests. Adding pip alongside that and you have a fantastic Python package manager/installer to use with the virtual environment. Below, I’ve outlined the steps required to use virtualenv and pip to automatically manage a custom environment for your Python jobs.\n\nThe Recipe\n\nFor this recipe to work, you should make sure that your agent machines all have virtualenv and pip installed and accessible from your agent agent’s $PATH. For Mac OS X users, sudo easy_install virtualenv should do the trick, Linux users should be able to run sudo [aptitude/yum/zypper] install python-virtualenv with your respective package manager. You will also need the SetEnv Plugin installed in Hudson.\n\nStep 1\n\nInside of the job’s configuration page ( http;//hudson/job/configure), we need to define an environment variable for the job. Using the SetEnv plugin, define a new $PATH : `PATH=.env/bin:$PATH\n\nWhat this will do is modify the $PATH environment variable for all of the \"Execute shell\" build steps in your job. As you might have guessed, we’re going to install the virtualenv in.env in the workspace root directory.\n\nStep 2\n\nTo set up the virtualenv, you want to add a build step of type \"Execute shell\" and paste the following commands into the text area:\n\nif [ -d \".env\" ]; then\n  echo \"**> virtualenv exists\"\nelse\n  echo \"**> creating virtualenv\"\n  virtualenv .env\nfi\n\nThis will create a virtualenv the first time the job runs on a particular agent, a virtualenv that will persist until the workspace is cleared. Since we’re going to install dependencies in the virtualenv, we want to keep it around between jobs to reduce the amount of network hits to download packages.\n\nStep 3\n\nWith our virtualenv and our $PATH properly set up, the job can now properly install dependencies into its virtualenv, this is where pip shines. A little known feature of pip allows you to define a \"requirements file\" which enumerates the packages to install. In my example project, I defined the following requirements in a file called pip-requires.txt\n\neventlet>=0.9.9\nnose>=0.11.3\nMySQL-python>=1.2.3c1\n\nIn my hypothetical example, I’ll need nose to run my tests, while eventlet and MySQL-python are required for my project to properly run. With the pip-requires.txt file in the root of my source repository, I can add an additional \"Execute shell\" build step that does the following:\n\npip install -r pip-requires.txt\n\nAssuming the $PATH environment variable was properly defined, this will use the virtualenv’s version of pip and it will install the packages defined in pip-requires.txt into the virtualenv! With the dependencies all properly installed in the virtualenv, I can now configure the remainder of my job to build my project and execute the tests.
