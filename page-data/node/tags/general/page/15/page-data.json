I will be giving the lecture in the rooms \"Back Bay\" (1 & 2) where people will be able to sit down, drink a beer, and learn how to write a Jenkins plugin!

That person shares the plugin with the community, and since it does everything he needs, he moves on to work on something else. Then another person starts using that plugin, comes up with an idea for improvement, implements that, and then moves on. Given that we have more than 900 plugins today, there are a plenty of plugins that are currently co-maintained by the community, which could really use a focused loving caregiver. +\n +\n\n+\nSo why don't you adopt a plugin? You can pick up one of those plugins and act as a maintainer. You'll hear appreciation from people who are using that plugin, and most plugins are small and simple enough even for people new to Jenkins. Above all, working on plugins don't require much communication with existing developers and implicit processes, which is often difficult for new people to find out. +\n +\n\n+\nHere's how you can find a plugin to adopt. You can look at https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pending+Pull+Requests[repositories that have most pending pull requests]. Plugins with lots of pull requests likely could use some help, so check if anyone is actively working on it and talk to him, or if you don't see much activities from a single person, just go ahead and adopt the plugin. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html[Usage statistics] has `+top-plugins500.svg+` (this is for https://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/201404-top-plugins500.svg[the last month]). Open that in Firefox, which lets you zoom in. Scroll all the way to the right, and you see popular plugins. Compare that with https://github.com/jenkinsci/[our GitHub repositories], and you can find popular plugins that aren't getting enough love. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel[Issue tracker] is also a good place to look for a plugin in need of help. Every plugin has a separate component, so look at bugs and RFEs filed against those, especially with lots of votes. Fix a bug is great, but even just helping with the triage process would be highly appreciated. +\n +\n\n+\nTry adopting a plugin for a while, and when you get the hang of it, let https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev[the dev list know]. Update `+pom.xml+` to have your name listed as a maintainer. Come https://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat[join IRC]. That way, we know who you are and how to reach you. +\n +\n\n+\nSee, it's really not that hard. And there's something really satisfying in making things a little better and seeing happy users. Anyway, looking forward to working with you!","title":"Adopt a plugin","tags":["general","jobs","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/kohsuke.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"9ede1c5f-3214-5d51-bb71-6a90d5ba08db","slug":"/blog/2014/04/24/juc-agenda-posted/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Allen_(author)[ +\nimage:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/The_Hidden_Agenda_3D.png/181px-The_Hidden_Agenda_3D.png[image] +\n] +\n\n+\n\n+\nAgenda is posted for Jenkins User Conference https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston[Boston] and https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin[Berlin]. +\n +\n\n+\nFor Boston, my favorite would be the https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/sessions#JesseGlick[workflow in Jenkins] talk that will cover the new workflow job type Jesse and I are working on.

It was originally used to test LTS releases, but over the time, it acquired a number of features, such as ...: +\n +\n\nDocker support for launching complex fixtures to test Jenkins with.\n\nPluggability to launch Jenkins under test (JUT) in many different environments\n\nPluggability to provision Jenkins and agents from EC2 to test large deployments\n\nChoice of cucumber or JUnit to write test scripts\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nWe are working on porting over existing test cases, but we'd like to work with users to move their acceptance tests on top of this same harness. The idea is to pool those test cases in the community so that we can test Jenkins and its plugins as we develop them. For this to work, we want tests to have lots of metadata (such as what plugins it touches), and for the harness to have sufficient modularity that different people can run the same scenario against different deployments, including existing instance. +","title":"Upcoming Jenkins Office Hours: Acceptance Test Harness","tags":["general","meetup","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/kohsuke.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","id":"51a8aab6-f27e-5e2b-a18b-4861c3f85998","slug":"/blog/2014/04/11/infoq-ci-survey-2014/","strippedHtml":"+\nInfoQ has been https://www.infoq.com/research/ci-server[running a CI server survey] for more than a month now, and here is the current result: +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://www.infoq.com/research/ci-server[ +\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/infoq.preview.png[image] +\n] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nJenkins has gotten more than 70% of the votes, once again proving the wide adoption among developers.
