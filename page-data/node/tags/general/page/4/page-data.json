See the security advisory for more information about these releases.\n\nUpdated 2015-11-06 03:55 UTC: Included a updated mitigation script which doesn’t have a Jenkins boot race condition\n\nEarlier today we received numerous reports about a previously undisclosed \" zero day\" critical remote code execution vulnerability and exploit in Jenkins core. Unfortunately the vulnerability was not disclosed to us ahead of its publication so we’re still working on more thorough fix. In the meantime however, we wanted to inform you of the issue and provide a workaround which will help prevent this exploit from being used against public Jenkins installations, for future reference this issue is being tracked privately as SECURITY-218 in our issue tracker.\n\nThe attack is mounted through the Jenkins CLI subsystem, so the work-around is to remove/disable the CLI support inside of the running Jenkins server.\n\nUsing the following Groovy script you can disable the attack vector in your Jenkins installations by navigating to “Manage Jenkins” and then to “Script Console”, or just go to https://your-jenkins-installation/script. This only addresses the current running Jenkins process, in order to make the workaround persist between restarts of the Jenkins server, add the script below to $JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy (create the directory if necessary, and the file).\n\nimport jenkins.*;\nimport jenkins.model.*;\nimport hudson.model.*;\n\n// disabled CLI access over TCP listener (separate port)\ndef p = AgentProtocol.all()\np.each { x ->\n  if (x.name.contains(\"CLI\")) p.remove(x)\n}\n\n// disable CLI access over /cli URL\ndef removal = { lst ->\n  lst.each { x -> if (x.getClass().name.contains(\"CLIAction\")) lst.remove(x) }\n}\ndef j = Jenkins.instance;\nremoval(j.getExtensionList(RootAction.class))\nremoval(j.actions)\n\nin order to make the workaround persist between restarts of the Jenkins server, add the script below to $JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy (create the directory if necessary, and the file).\n\nThe latest version of this script can be found in this GitHub repository.\n\nAs previously announced on the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list we’re preparing a security release for this upcoming Wednesday which will include patches for both the latest and LTS lines of Jenkins core. The Jenkins Security team is working to include a fix for this previously undisclosed exploit in or before this planned security release.\n\nIf you have questions about this exploit, join us in the #jenkins channel on Freenode or ask on the jenkinsci-users@ mailing list.\n\nFor security researchers and hobbyists, if you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Jenkins, we have some disclosure guidelines on this wiki page which will help us mitigate any discovered issues as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list ( jenkinsci-advisories), it’s the fastest way to get updates by the Jenkins Security team.","title":"Mitigating unauthenticated remote code execution 0-day in Jenkins CLI","tags":["general","core","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

The introduction of Java 8 last year brought performance improvements and highly desirable API changes, which make developing Java-based applications (arguably) much easier than before. The release was followed earlier this year by the end-of-life announcement for Java 7; the writing is on the wall: upgrade to Java 8.\n\nI wanted to answer the question \"does it even make sense to force an upgrade to Java 8?\" There are plenty of technical discussions that we can have in the community on whether or not this is the right approach, but my goal was to try and measure the current Jenkins install base for Java 8 preparedness.\n\nWhile we do not currently (to my knowledge) collect Java runtime versions in our anonymous usage statistics, we do have access logs from our mirror redirector which might provide some insight.\n\nWith some access logs data, I went through the millions of requests made to Jenkins infrastructure in 2015 and started filtering out the user agent which made those requests.\n\nNOTE: This data is totally not scientific and is only meant to provide a coarse insight into what versions of Java access Jenkins web infrastructure.\n\nWhen Jenkins hits the mirror network, it’s not overriding the default user agent from the Java runtime, so many of the user agents for the HTTP request are something like Java/1.7.0_75. This indicates that the request came from a Java Runtime version 1.7.0 (update 75).\n\nLooking at the major JVM versions making (non-unique) requests to Jenkins infrastructure we have:\n\n1.8.0 : 21,278,960\n\n1.7.0 : 27,340,214\n\n1.6.0 : 4,148,833\n\nThis breaks down across various updates as well, which is also particularly interesting to me because many of these Java versions have long since had security advisories posted against them. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/jvm-versions-with-updates.png\n\nAs I mentioned before, this is not a rigorous analysis of the access log data and is also not filtered by unique IP addresses. What I found most interesting though is that the Java 8 upgrade numbers are actually fairly strong, which I didn’t expect. I expect that piece of the pie will continue to grow. Hopefully so much so that we’re able to move over to Java 8 before the end of 2016!","title":"What JVM versions are running Jenkins?","tags":["general","just for fun"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

We started with some more internally facing changes and have slowly progressed from the \"inside-out\" to today’s topic: improving the out of the box user experience. That is to say, the experience that a brand-new Jenkins user has when getting started with the server.\n\nJust to recap, so far we’ve reviewed:\n\nIntroducing a policy for API deprecation\n\nSplitting Groovy out of 'core'\n\nPipeline as code front and center\n\nUser experience improvements (part one)\n\nThe subject of today’s proposal is captured in JENKINS-31157 , which, like yesterday’s proposal, contains a few issues linked from it with more details.\n\nAt a high level, the problem aiming to be solved is:\n\nWhen a new user installs Jenkins, they are greeted with the main, empty, dashboard which suggests that they \"create jobs.\" This makes no mention of plugins or the configuration options that are relevant to helping the user make Jenkins match their needs.\n\nIn past and current versions of Jenkins, if you know what you’re looking for it’s relatively easy to move around the interface. If you’ve never used Jenkins before, it can be very challenging to find your way around or even know what it is possible to do with Jenkins.\n\nThe proposed changes aim to address this initial confusion:\n\nInstead of changing the post-install defaults, which may not properly represent the user’s needs, the first-time user experience should help guide the user through configuration and plugin installation quickly so they can use Jenkins for their needs. Effectively it should be as easy as possible for a user to arrive at a good configuration for their usage.\n\nJenkins contributor Tom Fennelly, who has led this discussion on the mailing lists in the past, has posted a good prototype screencast of what some of this might entail:\n\nProviding Feedback\n\nWe’re asking you to read the issues linked from JENKINS-31157 and comment and vote on those issues accordingly.\n\nIf you have ever logged in to the issue\ntracker or the\nwiki, you have a \"Jenkins user account\" which\nmeans you’ll be able to log into the issue tracker and vote for, or comment on\nthe issue linked above.\n\n( note : if you have forgotten your password, use the account\napp to reset it.)\n\nWe’re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either\napprove or reject the proposal two weeks from today.\n\nThis concludes this week’s blog series highlighting some of the Jenkins 2.0 proposals we felt were important to discuss with the broader Jenkins user audience.

This requires large amounts of effort to create and manage jobs to test and build multiple projects and keeps the actual configuration of a job to build/test/deploy a project separate from the actual code being built/tested/deployed. This prevents users from applying their existing CI/CD best practices to the job configurations themselves.\n\nTo address this, Kohsuke is proposing that we :\n\nIntroduce a new subsystem in Jenkins that:\n\nlets you design a whole pipeline, not just a single linear set of tasks\n\nstores the said pipeline configuration as human-editable Jenkinsfile in your SCM\n\nmakes it automatic to set up new pipelines when Jenkinsfile is added\n\ndifferentiates multiple branches in the same repository\n\nThis is the key new feature that positions Jenkins for continuous delivery use cases and other more complex automations of today.\n\nKohsuke’s proposal is largely about bringing together a lot of already existing pieces together to provide a very compelling experience for new and existing users alike. I hope it is clear now why this proposal is so exciting to me.\n\nProviding Feedback\n\nWe’re asking you to read the proposal in\nJENKINS-31152, which itself have some additional tickets linked under it, and provide\nfeedback if you have it.\n\nIf you have ever logged in to the issue\ntracker or the\nwiki, you have a \"Jenkins user account\" which\nmeans you’ll be able to log into the issue tracker and vote for, or comment on\nthe issue linked above.\n\n( note : if you have forgotten your password, use the account\napp to reset it.)\n\nWe’re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either\napprove or reject the proposal two weeks from today.\n\nStay tuned for a couple more posts covering proposals to improve the Jenkins interface and user experience!","title":"Jenkins 2.0 Proposal: Pipeline as Code front and center","tags":["general","core","pipeline","workflow","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

In a recent \"Office Hours\" session, Kohsuke Kawaguchi presented his\nvision for Jenkins 2.0 in a office\nhours session, the slides for\nwhich can be found in this Google\nPresentation.\nRoughly paraphrasing Kohsuke’s vision, 2.0 is primarily about making things\nbetter for the thousands of users out there.\n\nThis week, we’ll be reviewing some key areas of the \"Jenkins 2.0\" proposal.\nAsking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these proposals, going\nfrom Jenkins internals to user interface.\n\nThus far we’ve covered:\n\nIntroducing a policy for API deprecation\n\nToday’s post involves a proposal originally from community member Jesse Glick who has proposed in JENKINS-29068 that Groovy be split out from the \"core\" Jenkins distribution. The linked issue expands on what the problem is here:\n\nCurrently Jenkins embeds a distribution of Groovy into \"core\" for a variety of scripting and management tasks. This version of Groovy is locked into core in such a way that users cannot upgrade Groovy independently from Jenkins itself. If the Jenkins-bundled version were upgraded to a different major version, it may break users' custom scripts as well as plugins that use Groovy due to API changes.\n\nThe proposal is relatively straight-forward and affects the many different users and use-cases for the embedded Groovy scripting support in Jenkins:\n\nFor ease of maintenance and modularity it would be useful to split Jenkins' use of Groovy into a library plugin; different clients could request 1.x and 2.x simultaneously by using different versions of the library, etc.\n\nStuff in core using Groovy that would need to either be put in this library (if infrastructure for other features) or put in another plugin depending on it (if first-class features themselves):\n\nI selected this proposal to feature on this blog, despite its rather technical underpinnings, it will affect core developers, plugin developers, power and casual users alike. I encourage everybody to read through the proposal and its potential impact on the issue tracker.\n\nProviding Feedback\n\nWe’re asking you to read the proposal in\nJENKINS-29068 and provide\nfeedback if you have it.\n\nIf you have ever logged in to the issue\ntracker or the\nwiki, you have a \"Jenkins user account\" which\nmeans you’ll be able to log into the issue tracker and vote for, or comment on\nthe issue linked above.\n\n( note : if you have forgotten your password, use the account\napp to reset it.)\n\nWe’re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either\napprove or reject the proposal two weeks from today.\n\nStay tuned for the rest of the week as we keep with our theme of going \"from the inside out\" and help us make Jenkins 2.0 great!","title":"Jenkins 2.0 Proposal: Split Groovy out of \"core\"","tags":["general","core","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
