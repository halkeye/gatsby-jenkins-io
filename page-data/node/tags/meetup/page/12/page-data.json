In parallel to the meetup in Oslo and the meetup in JavaOne, Nokia and InfraDNA are hosting a meetup in Copenhagen on September 6th, Monday. Read on for the details.\n\nThe current tentative plan is to do a short \"state of the union / what’s new\" kind of presentation, then use the rest of the time for open mic Q&A, but if you have other ideas, or better yet if you want to do some talks, please let me know. I think the event will be fun.\n\nIf you plan on coming, please drop me a note, so that we can get some sense of the attendance.\n\nWhen: September 6th, 18:30\n\nWhere: Auditorium 1, Nokia Denmark A/S, København ( map)\n\nFood will be provided.","title":"Copenhagen Hudson User Meetup","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":"4e8f1e15-fa1f-5d4d-a8b5-f848a400e7f7","slug":"/blog/2010/08/31/hudson-at-javazone-meetup-in-oslo/","strippedHtml":"JavaZone is a big Java conference in Scandinavia, and Hudson is well represented there.

So in that spirit, InfraDNA will be organizing a Hudson User Meetup at The Scotsman from Sep 8th 19:30 ( website.) We’ll get together, have some drinks, and enjoy geeky conversations.\n\nSo if you are local or visiting Oslo for JavaZone, come join us.
