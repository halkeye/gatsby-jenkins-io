Like the East Coast conference, the Berlin one is almost full, so sign up while you can.\n\nOur venue in Berlin is KOSMOS, a building with a fascinating history. The building was inaugurated as a cinema in 1961. With 1001 seats, it was the largest, most modern and most popular film theatre in the former GDR and has since been extensively modernized in line with the requirements of historically listed buildings.\n\nWe have an excellent line-up of speakers filling up two conference tracks.\n\nOnce again, we have some fabulous sponsors to thank. Without them, there would be no JUC.\n\nThis year we’ve introduced a new Community sponsorship level, which allows non-corporate groups like JUGSs to help support the conference as well. (Drop a note to juc-oc-ext AT cloudbees DOT com if your group is interested).\n\nWe are very grateful to all of our sponsors – thank you! Hopefully see everyone at JUC.\n\nPS – if you are coming to Berlin for JUC, check out the CD Summit on June 24 at the same venue. There’s also one on June 19 in NYC. The summit will focus on how continuous integration with Jenkins streamlines processes and automates testing and deployment, providing the foundation you need for continuous delivery.","title":"Two Weeks Till Jenkins User Conference Berlin","tags":["general","meetup","news","jenkinsci","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"lisawells","html":"","id":"lisawells","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Lisa Wells","slug":"/blog/authors/lisawells","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","id":"b66f126d-826e-5d04-b55d-285c4d0f9e47","slug":"/blog/2014/06/06/other-events-for-juc-visitors-cd-seminar/","strippedHtml":"+ +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIf you will be on the US East Coast or in Berlin for JUC, some of the JUC sponsors are organizing separate events called https://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit[Continuous Delivery Seminar], which might be of interest to you.

I will be giving the lecture in the rooms \"Back Bay\" (1 & 2) where people will be able to sit down, drink a beer, and learn how to write a Jenkins plugin! I will be teaching people everything from how to get started, to some advanced techniques like writing a new https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI[CLI Command], and writing your own builder.
