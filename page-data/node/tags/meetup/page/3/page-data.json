I would like to thank everybody who took the time to watch, chat and present in the Hacker Hangout.\n\nNow that everybody has had time to recover from the turkey and travel, we have some videos of the sessions sliced out and ready for publication.\n\nIn addition to the recorded sessions, there were a number of notes captured with useful links associated with practically each session. You can find those notes at the bottom of the Hacksgiving page.\n\nThe following videos are all available in this YouTube playlist\n\nIntro to the Jenkins project\n\nThis session was hosted by rtyler and meant to provide a cursory overview of where to get started with contributing to the Jenkins project\n\nIntro to Plugin Development Workshop\n\nThis session was given both days of Hacksgiving by schristou and does a really great job of introducing the viewer to getting started with developing a Jenkins plugin with Java.\n\nWorkflow Q&A and Demo Session\n\nThis session was not originally scheduled, but some folks on the Jenkins IRC channel had some Workflow questions and Jesse Glick jumped into the Hacker Hangout to help us out!\n\nInternationalization Live Coding / Q&A\n\nAnother impromptu session, this time with danielbeck hosting. In this session Daniel walks through a plugin he was working on for Hacksgiving and adds internationalization support while answering a few questions here and there.\n\nIntro to the new static site\n\nKicking off day two of Hacksgiving, rtyler hosted a session on the new statically-generated Jenkins site. The new site will dramatically lower the barrier to entry for contribution to Jenkins documentation and blogs, by pushing everything through GitHub.\n\nPlugin Developer Open Q&A\n\nThis was the last session of Hacksgiving, hosted by abayer and ended up being more like a casual discussion of the current status and future work in the plugin development ecosystem.","title":"Hacksgiving Left-overs","tags":["general","meetup","video","pipeline","workflow"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","id":"e0610191-1961-5c28-92d5-a79db68f7476","slug":"/blog/2015/11/06/october-jams/","strippedHtml":"It is great to see the pick up of local activities through hosted JAMs. In October, the Jenkins community hosted Atlanta JAM and Bay Area JAM.

What a way to kick off the first JAM other than to have Docker, John Willis as our guest speaker. John talked about immutable infrastructure and its benefits and role of containers.\n\n+\n+\n\nKohsuke discussed Jenkins Workflow, the motivation behind the same and latest features of Jenkins Workflow like multi branch support followed by docker use cases. The highlight of the meetup was definitely Kohsuke breaking the news about Jenkins 2.0 and his vision and motivation behind it.\n\n+\n+\n\nThe next Bay Area JAM is slated for Oct 21.

As of recently, there hasn’t been as much activity, so this program needs to be revived!\n\n+\n+\n\nThere are over 120,000 active Jenkins installations now and that number just keeps climbing and climbing. It’s important to bring all of us together through big events like the Jenkins User Conference, but not everyone can get there. That is why Meetups and smaller Jenkins events are crucial.\n\n+\n+\n\nTo support this effort, CloudBees has announced that they will be sponsoring the kickoff of the CIA revival/https://jenkins-ci.org/content/bay-area-jenkins-area-meet-looking-you[JAM] to help the Jenkins community host these Meetups!\n\n+\n+\n\nTo kick this off, the first Jenkins Area Meetup (JAM) is in the San Jose CloudBees office on Sept 23.

Our goal is to enable more members of the community to meet each other and exchange ideas in person.\n\nWe’re still hashing out the details, but it’ll be available to every Jenkins community member. Apply, telling us what Jenkins-related event you’d like to attend and how awesome you are, and we may support your travel with up to 500 USD. For details on how this will work, see the current draft of the travel grant program.\n\nThe first person to be supported in this way is Pradeepto Bhattacharya from Pune, India. He was a speaker at this year’s JUC Europe in London, and will give two talks at JUC US West next week—​and we help him get there! He asked us a few weeks back whether the Jenkins project could support his trip to the US. We came to the conclusion that this would be a good idea—​so good in fact, that we decided to build a regular program from it.\n\nAre you planning to attend a JUC or similar event, but worry about the cost of travel? We may be able to help you out!","title":"Announcing the travel grant program","tags":["general","meetup","news"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","id":"22d4139d-ee6d-5c7b-973f-521b127b04f7","slug":"/blog/2015/08/04/bay-area-jenkins-area-meet-up-kick-off-gathering-today/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves[image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Welovejam_blenheim_apricot_jam.jpg[image]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA week ago https://jenkins-ci.org/content/bay-area-jenkins-area-meet-looking-you[we reported that Uday is looking at organizing a regular Jenkins meet-up in Silicon Valley].
