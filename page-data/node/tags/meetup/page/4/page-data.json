We have finalized most of the dates and locations for the 2015 Jenkins User Conference (JUC) World Tour.\n\n+\n+\n\nSave the date(s):\n\n+\n+\n\nUS East (Washington DC): June 18-19\n\nEurope (London): June 23-24\n\nIsrael: July 16 (ETA)\n\nUS West (Santa Clara): September 2-3\n\n+\n+\n\nThe big news? The JUC agenda has been expanded this year to cover two days! That means you get twice as many opportunities to learn how others are using Jenkins and to network with other Jenkins users.\n\n+\n+\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS IS OPEN FOR ALL JUC CONFERENCES\n\n+\n+\n\nWe need JUC speakers! The Call for Papers is open now and you can apply here. This is an opportunity for YOU to give back to the community by sharing your Jenkins knowledge and success. Jenkins speakers contribute significantly to the overall JUC experience.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn return for speaking, you will receive free admission to the conference and fame/fortune within the Jenkins community. OK, we can’t guarantee the latter, but we can guarantee the former! Hurry and apply now, because the Call for Papers deadline for US East and Europe expires on March 22, 2015.\n\n+\n+\n\nNot interested in speaking? Another way to contribute to the community is by letting us know who you want to hear from. Nominate or refer that amazing speaker and we’ll do the rest. Contact alytong13@gmail.com\n\n+\n+\n\nJUC SPONSORSHIPS\n\n+\n+\n\nLastly, be a JUC sponsor. Any organization can do this – whether a vendor that sells into the Jenkins ecosystem or a company that has received value from Jenkins and wants to give back to the community. You can find out more here. (NOTE: JUC is not a moneymaking venture for the community – so sponsorships do make a difference.)","title":"Jenkins User Conference – Save the Date","tags":["general","meetup","news","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"blog/author/alyssat","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"6b52335f-acb3-5e6f-9167-4b7dde3aa96a","slug":"/blog/2015/02/24/100k-celebration-podcast-recording/","strippedHtml":"+\nIn preparation for https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-celebration-day-february-26[Jenkins 100K celebration], I'm going to record a one-time podcast with Dean Yu, Andrew Bayer, and R.
