The meeting will be in the evening, at the location to be determined. I am presenting in person, as well as Cactusman, one of the key community people in Japan. Seung-Heui Jang from Samsung would be presenting about job batch processing by Groovy scripts.\n\nAccording to the installation statistics, we know there are significant user base in Korea, but so far the main Jenkins community has failed to establish contacts with them. I’m really excited that I can finally fix this situation!\n\nIf you are interested in coming, please RSVP at meetup.com. The event will be free. We are still looking for a few more speakers (including lightning talks), so please share your experiences with Jenkins, plugins you’ve been working on, and so forth with the rest of the Korean Jenkins people.\n\nLooking forward to seeing many of you!","title":"한국에서의 첫번째 Jenkins meet-up!","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"8ac5933a-96b7-5a2b-9d41-2181c54255a5","slug":"/blog/2012/12/20/jenkins-keynote-at-fosdem-2013/","strippedHtml":"Earlier this year we participated in FOSDEM 2012 in Brussels, Belgium. Overall the event was a major success and we’re very happy we were able to take part in it!\n\nFor FOSDEM 2013, we’ll be back in Brussels and participating in a major way. The first day of FOSDEM (February 2, 2013) will be the 2nd birthday for the Jenkins project, and seems appropriate that project founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi will be giving a keynote session titled: \" How we made the Jenkins community \"\n\nHere’s an excerpt from Kohsuke’s talk proposal:\n\nJenkins project has an interesting history. It started from scratch on my spare time, and grow over time to boast 600+ open-source plugins developed by 300+ contributors from all around the world.\n\nThere are several key ingredients, both technical and social, that enabled this model, and I think those ingredients are useful to other projects. In this talk, I’ll discuss how Jenkins project and the community works, what these ingredients are, why they help you attract more developers into your projects, and why it matters.\n\nYou can read more about Kohsuke’s keynote here\n\nIn addition to the keynote, I ( R. Tyler Croy), and a number of members of the Jenkins, Cucumber and Selenium communities are hosting the first ever Testing and Automation devroom at FOSDEM.\n\nIf you’re interested in submitting a talk proposal for the dev room the deadline is 23:59 UTC on December 21st 2012! The Call for Proposals can be found here, and the proposal submission form can can be found here.\n\nWe are very likely going to have a table in the hall again this year, but the FOSDEM committee hasn’t yet confirmed whether or not we will have a table.\n\nRegardless, a lot of Jenkins community members will be at FOSDEM in February in addition to hundreds of other open source contributors and users from around the world.\n\nIf you’re interested in participating and/or meeting up with the Jenkins crowd, there’s details coming together on the FOSDEM wiki page .\n\nWe hope to see you there!","title":"Jenkins keynote at FOSDEM 2013","tags":["general","cia","meetup","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

If you're interested in building an active local Jenkins community, read on to learn how. Really, we can sum it up in one simple step: +\n +\n\nJust Do It!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nAdmittedly more detailed guidelines can be useful, so hopefully these steps will give you a roadmap and some ideas: +\n +\n\n+\nFind an organizer or two. This is probably you. If you can draft a friend, colleague, or random acquaintance or three to help, even better. To enlist additional help in your area, put the word out on the Jenkins Dev email list and on your Twitter account using the hashtag #JenkinsCI.\n\n+\nLet the Jenkins project know. Let us know so that we can help you. We can promote it on the JenkinsCI blog, promote that on Twitter, and post a summary blog. We can send stickers for you to hand out in the meetup, and we can send you a T-shirt for you to wear. We might be even able to find you additional agents I mean helpers in your city. And if you’re recording the event or streaming it live (we can tell you how), the whole Jenkins world may want to know!\n\n+\nDecide how often you want to meet. Once a month is a good frequency, but if you feel like all you can manage is every two months or even every quarter, go for it! You can always change it.\n\n+\nGo to Meetup.com. We have an account that we can let you use, or you can create your own meetup. They make it very easy to manage attendance and also to spread the word to people with similar interests in your community.\n\n+\nDetermine the topic for your first meetup. You could feature a speaker or two, or host a panel discussion, or just get folks together to talk about how you use Jenkins. YOU would probably be a great speaker for your first meetup – or perhaps some of your colleagues or friends. If you prefer to stay behind the scenes, Twitter and the Jenkins Dev list can help you find a speaker too. And as your meetup grows, you’ll have an automatic pool of interested parties.\n\n+\nCome up with a format for the meetup. Here’s an idea for a schedule:\n6-6:30pm: Check in, Networking & Munchies\n6:30-6:35: Announcements\n6:35-7:15: Speaker/panel (can also have 2 speakers, which might go longer)\n7:15-7:30: Q&A\n7:30: Wrap up, chat\n8:00: Say goodnight, or go out together and keep drinking\n\n+\nFind a venue, preferably a free one. Ideally, your company or one you know can host… then the venue is free. Alternate solutions: hotels (which unfortunately cost $$$) or reserve a room at a local bar or restaurant. Sometimes a university or even a library can help out with a free room.\n\n+\nAsk a company or two to sponsor the meetup, which consists of paying for food and drinks for all (and some companies will bring along SWAG). Often the company hosting the venue will also sponsor. Sponsoring is a great way for companies to generate positive publicity in their locale, to get the word out that they’re hiring, and to support the Jenkins community in general.\n\n+\nPlan the room logistics. Consider how you want the room to be set up – theater style or as individual tables to encourage group discussions. Also make arrangements to secure a projector and screen. It’s a good idea to bring along connectors for both Mac and PC.\n\n+\nGet the word out in any way you can. Some ideas:\n\nTell us so that we can promote it through our existing channels.\n\nIf you use Meetup.com, they’ll help get the word out. And as more people join to attend one meetup, they’ll receive word about future meetups too. EventBrite is also good about suggesting events in your area that might interest you.\n\nEmail folks at your company who might be interested\n\nEmail friends and former colleagues and ask them to spread the word\n\nPost the event to your Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn profiles\n\nIf you know of any calendars that highlight local Tech events in your area, post your meetup there. Likewise for any Tech email digests you may receive.\n\n+\n\n+\n +\nAdditional tips: +\n\nGet someone to record the event. Doesn’t have to be professional quality – a Flip cam or SmartPhone can take perfectly usable video (just make sure they can record long enough!). Better yet, stream it live if you can! Broadcasting makes the event accessible to the world, not just your community, and word will travel even farther! As well, future speakers can get an idea for how your group does things.\n\nPlan that ~50% of the people who RSVP won’t make it. It’s a free event, and plans tend to change. Order food and drink accordingly.\n\nRemember that free food and BEvERages are strong motivators! Pizza, giant subs, or other local favorite are great choices. For BEvERages, you’re probably fine with beer, Coke and water.\n\nBring a sign-in sheet and name tags (and pens).\n\nConsider asking the sponsor to bring SWAG or raffle off something cool (maybe even their product or service).\n\nAt the beginning or end of the meetup, ask attendees to suggest topics they want to cover in future meetups. Or have them write down suggestions and put them in a box (then maybe raffle off a prize from the pool of contributors).\n\nVary the format of your meetup – presentation, Birds of a Feather discussion, hackathon, lightning talks, white board night, Jenkins problem-solving session… all of these may interest your audience. If you can, switch the venue as well – that way people get to see other interesting companies, and can also choose to attend meetups that may be more convenient to them.\n\nStart and end on time. If things start to run over, you can always break and let people know they can go if they need to, but are welcome to stay if they like.\n\nJoin forces with other groups when you can – this builds up both of your groups! For example, host a joint Jenkins-Selenium group on the topic of Testing with Jenkins.\n\n+\n +\nStill have questions? https://twitter.com/jenkinsci[Give us a holler]! +\n +\n +\n**Special thanks to our friends at https://www.saucelabs.com[Sauce Labs] for some of this content — they wrote https://sauceio.com/index.php/2011/10/so-you-want-to-start-a-selenium-meetup-group-now-what/[a similar guide] for starting Selenium meetups.","title":"Start Your Own Jenkins Meetup in 10 Easy Steps","tags":["general","cia","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"lisawells","html":"","id":"lisawells","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Lisa Wells","slug":"/blog/authors/lisawells","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","id":"63d0593a-8c6c-5de0-8378-c28c4b7c4062","slug":"/blog/2012/09/12/jenkins-user-event-cph/","strippedHtml":"This article was originally posted on my personal blog\n\n+\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U254sLok_CA/UEyaAzMGpYI/AAAAAAAAHuI/--wuCdF0j2Y/s1600/IMAG0397.jpg[image:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U254sLok_CA/UEyaAzMGpYI/AAAAAAAAHuI/--wuCdF0j2Y/s640/IMAG0397.jpg[image,width=640,height=102]]\n\n+\n +\n +\nLast week, https://www.praqma.com/[praqma] was organizing in Copenhague a \"Jenkins User Event\". A User Event, compared to JenkinsConf, is a lighter meeting with (suposed to be) reduced costs organized by volunteers. Praqma got sponsorship from both https://www.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees] and https://www.programmingresearch.com/[Programing Research] so that they can book a high quality conference room and prepare a nice meeting with all commodities. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v4CkSM9Sdog/UEyXZlXwSFI/AAAAAAAAHt4/D8g72T1meas/s1600/IMAG0388.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v4CkSM9Sdog/UEyXZlXwSFI/AAAAAAAAHt4/D8g72T1meas/s320/IMAG0388.jpg[image,width=240,height=320]]\n\n+\nThat was my first travel to Danemark.

I contribute a group to solve an integration issue by https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/558[creating a new extension] point in jenkins-core. Those already confident with jenkins development helped to write this code, some discovered the extension point design as well as way to contribute to jenkins (github pull request, etc), some were looking at jenkins source code for first time so learned a lot. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8aFBYs3PV2I/UEyZp3x53sI/AAAAAAAAHuA/T0_1zOKFVn8/s1600/IMAG0391.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8aFBYs3PV2I/UEyZp3x53sI/AAAAAAAAHuA/T0_1zOKFVn8/s640/IMAG0391.jpg[image,width=640,height=292]]\n\n+\n +\n +\n +\n +\nDay ended with beer then a chinese restaurant (typical Danish food :P), with lots of fun and nice discussions. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://www.praqma.com/sites/default/files/img/event_logo.png[image:https://www.praqma.com/sites/default/files/img/event_logo.png[image,width=320,height=138]]\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\nFriday was the Jenkins User Event. To reduce costs for such an event, compared to other Jenkins Conferences organized by CloudBees this year, lunch was not provided and conference program was \"packed\" into afternoon. This let praqma get a \"reasonable\" cost for this nice event, but still have a high quality conference, with printed programs, goodies, and coffee break. All praqma team was involved to make this event as pleasant as possible for all attendees, thanks a lot to them for contributing ! +\n +\n +\n +\nConference was sold-out on friday morning, with 80 attendees. +\n +\n +\n +\nAfter Lars Kruse welcome speak, and CloudBees to announce partnership with Praqma for DK, the conference started with two options : either an introduction to Jenkins, or an open-space discussion (~barcamp-like) for those that already know it well. I joined a small group first discussing about pre-tested commit, and then we divert speaking about best-practices, job and test performances issues, etc. Was a great exchange with interesting feedback. +\n +\n +\n +\nThe rest of the conference was single-track. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oCA1lQnDBeE/UEybtag0JmI/AAAAAAAAHuY/QSofsZ_ae1M/s1600/IMAG0408.jpg[image:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oCA1lQnDBeE/UEybtag0JmI/AAAAAAAAHuY/QSofsZ_ae1M/s400/IMAG0408.jpg[image,width=400,height=300]]\n\n+\n +\n +\n1rst session was about \"_facilitate strategic reuse of software_\" using jenkins CI. This session exposed how a industrial company changed it's internal software development practices and team organization to share components and be more efficient. This for sure introduced some coordinations and integration costs but resulted in a significant productivity improvement. This talk was interesting as it demonstrate that highly industrial companies (here, a low energy consuming water pumps producer) today follow development practice to share component and use continuous integration practice to help. I just wondered speaker said \"Clearcase facilitated\" sharing components  -I wouldn't expected those two words in same sentence :P +\n +\n +\n +\n\"_Tales from the trenches_\" was a funny session explaining how Nokia came from stone age (manual integration with code freezes) to modern development practices. After reinventing the wheel with ~15 home made, perl-script based CI tools, they switched to Jenkins and Git as common tooling. Explanation on Git selection, evaluating multiple DVCS popularity, then migration from ClearCase, [.underline]#helping a lot# early adopters, and later evaluating benefits (1 day / week / developer) was very interesting. Conclusion was that, \"some tools a radically better\" and \"deep process renewal depends heavily on tools renewal\". +\n +\n +\n +\n\"_Continuous Code Inspection_\" talk explained use of industrial C++ coding standard and normative coding convention, with dedicated analysis tools. After explanation on those rules and tooling, a dedicated jenkins plugin was demonstrated. Such jenkins integration makes QA mostly a single checkbox to enable, and provide history graphs, reports, and external tools integration. Introduction was a little slow imho but content was demonstrating the power of jenkins plugin model to adapt software factory to specific industrial needs. +\n +\n +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vgq2K5JLj30/UEyfE86usmI/AAAAAAAAHuw/q4vbgqguyuY/s1600/IMAG0409.jpg[image:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vgq2K5JLj30/UEyfE86usmI/AAAAAAAAHuw/q4vbgqguyuY/s320/IMAG0409.jpg[image,width=320,height=240]]\n\n+\n +\n +\nCoffee break with delicious Danish chocolates ... +\n +\n +\n +\nSony was presenting its \"_Huge Jenkins Cluster_\", with 4 controllers, some of them handling up to 6000 jobs, 300 agents, 7000 builds a day an executing 175,000 tests a day for android platforms. Development teams use a dedicated agent machine with android devices connected through USB. +\n +\n +\n +\nSuch a build farm requires a dedicated support team and monitoring/maintenance tooling. IT only provides the computer and maintain the OS, but all Jenkins stuff is under the hands of a dedicated team. They evaluate plugins and core upgrades, educate teams, and analyse errors. +\n +\n +\n +\nWith 45Gb for a single full android build, they have to monitor available disk space, and developed maintenance scripts to delete old build artifacts and cleanup /tmp. They also use a local git mirror to speed-up cloning, and integrated with CFEngine-managed infrastructure to ensure no update occurs as a agent is running a build. They also significantly optimized build speed by switching from NFS to SAN, and are now evaluating XFS. +\n +\n +\n +\nRemaining issue is about jenkins build queue (subject discussed on Jenkins Code Camp) because a 9 in the morning, thousand users connect to jenkins controller and the UI widget to expose the queue status hits the queue synchronisation bottleneck. +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\nNext talk was mine, exposing https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb[Jenkins Enterprise] and demonstrating one ouf our Enterprise plugins. I'm not pleased by my talk, both because my english is crappy (maybe you already noticed?) and also because I was not confident with the standard JE slides. Assuming I had more time to prepare this talk, and as a tribute to this Danish event, I'd have used a bunch of lego bricks pictures to present Cloudbee plugins. So I quickly left the slides to run a demo, setting-up Jenkins Enterprise to run https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb[pre-tested commits]. Hope you enjoyed the talk. +\n +\n +\n +\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mnHy9gx9uGw/UEyixY_2Q0I/AAAAAAAAHvI/_KDQbGOTjw8/s1600/IMAG0407.jpg[image:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mnHy9gx9uGw/UEyixY_2Q0I/AAAAAAAAHvI/_KDQbGOTjw8/s320/IMAG0407.jpg[image,width=240,height=320]]Last talk was Lars one, exposing praqma \"_Corporate approach to opensource_\". This light, generalist talk was welcome as last one after a heavy-technical afternoon. Lars exposed reason to switch to open-source : +\n +\n +\n +\n\ncosts - for sure,\n\nbut also open standards and interoperability,\n\nand contribution to public good.\n\n+\nThis last point distinguish \"_innovators_\" that create new content and contribute to the oss project, and \"_free riders_\" that only want to save money and consume other efforts. Lars didn't went deeper into what \"contributing\" can be about, but spending some time joining the mailing lists, exposing detailled bug report, or writing blogs or documentation about the issues you encounter is already a huge contribution to opensource. Organizing such a great user event also is ;) +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\n +\nMeeting ended with a \"socialize\" time, sponsored by Pragmatic Research, with beer and sandwiches. A nice time to discuss with speakers, know a face to match an #irc nickname, discuss about everything geeks like to discuss about, and round off this pleasant day. +","title":"Jenkins User Event CPH","tags":["general","meetup"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"ndeloof","html":"","id":"ndeloof","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Nicolas De Loof","slug":"/blog/authors/ndeloof","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"meetup","limit":8,"skip":64,"numPages":13,"currentPage":9}},
