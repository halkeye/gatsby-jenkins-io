We ended up having 25.\nWe considered having more people, but finally decided that for a first time it would be better to start not too big.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nInfrastructure was sponsored by DigitalOcean.\n\nFor each attendee, we provisioned :\n\nOne Controller, preconfigured to be able to dynamically provision agents.\n\nOne staging environment\n\nOne production environment\n[ 1 ]\n\nOne SonarQube instance\n\nWorkshop content & infrastructure\n\nAfter an initial quick presentation to settle context and remind some general things about Continuous Delivery and Jenkins, we started the workshop per se.\n\nIt is composed of 3 parts, which are readable here [ 2 ], but very few people were able to start the part 3.\n\nHackergarten / Unconference\n\nSo we let people decide what they wanted to work on during the afternoon.\n\nWe decided to use post-its: each attendee would write down what they wanted to work on, one idea per post-it (max 2 per person).\nThen, we dropped those onto a white-board and tried grouping those by theme.\n\nIn the end, overall, the following themes went out:\n\nHack on Jenkins development & Contribute to Jenkins\n\nComplete the workshops\n\nWork on use-case oriented things\n\nWork on Docker & Pipeline join usages\n\nHackergarten\n\nMany Jenkins accounts were created, and many JIRA and pull requests were filed.\nIt was nice to see people asking questions like: \"so, should I create a JIRA issue for this?\" or \"how do I interact with people\".\nPretty generic \"how do I work on open source software\" questions sometimes, but important because you felt like people were genuinely interested and needed not much to start contributing.\n\nHere are the pull requests filed during this afternoon:\n\nblueocean-pipeline-editor-plugin#30\n\njenkins#2785\n\njenkins#2786\n\njenkins#2787\n\njenkins#2788\n\nYou can see that though most of the PRs were typo-related, the one that got merged first was the one about code :-).\n\nSo, Jeremie Violas wins the Bobble Head as promised!\n\nWhy so many typo-related PRs?\n\nSimply because people were somehow encouraged to find some to get used to the\nround trip of: fixing an issue and filing the associated pull request, rinse &\nrepeat.\n\nI do think this is also a pretty nice and simple first step to understand how\nto build Jenkins and start interacting with the community.\n\nThe result\n\nPeople seemed pretty happy and we got some nice comments like \"now I have a clearer vision of what this Pipeline thing is about\".\nSome attendees also dropped nice comments on the meetup page.\nSo it’s cool because when you’re doing such things on your free time, it’s the main reward you can get.\n\nIf you’re an attendee to such events, don’t forget to thank people organizing\nthose, and more importantly to provide constructive feedback.  We are generally\neager to know what could be done better for next time.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall we are very happy with the energy of that day, and we definitely plan to set up a new session in the next few months, probably with a bit more people.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\nInfrastructure: when you plan to have many VM per attendee, double-check the limits your Cloud Provider may have by default. I had bumped it to 250 the day before the workshop, and asked for another one to 500 during the workshop (though in the end, 250 was probably enough, but this’ll give room for the next time with more people :-)).\n\nLogistics: warning, secret ahead: this is very time consuming.\nNot necessarily the amount of work itself, more that it implies very big latency.\nFor instance, give it 2 to 3 weeks minimum to have answers about sponsoring in general. Pinging again in case of no answer after 2 days would probably be seen as rude, and possibly lead to make things worse for obvious reasons, so plan ahead.\n\nThank you\n\nDigitalOcean for sponsoring the Infrastructure\n\nWe got way more than 100 VMs running at the same time during the day thanks to their help!\n\nHarryCow Coworking for hosting the event\n\nTo CloudBees for sponsoring the food for all the participants\n\nAlso for providing a bunch of goodies: stickers and T-Shirts for everybody\n\nGitHub for providing stickers\n\n1. For the sake of the simplicity of the workshop, those environments were actually a single VM: the goal was here to illustrate what we could do using Jenkins Pipeline, discussing scalability or more involved deployment techniques was obviously out of scope.\n\n2. in French only for now, but translating it into English to make it possibly shared and reusable among JAMs is being discussed","title":"Pipeline Workshop & Hackergarten @ ToulouseJAM Feedback","tags":["hackergarten","jam","meetup","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8e8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/ede19/batmat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/bc20c/batmat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/f1e03/batmat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/b691b/batmat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/8ba60/batmat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/a9ea7/batmat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/51559/batmat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/28f98/batmat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":130}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/05e25bcf6699abfce74f0630971e7c78/batmat.jpg"},"blog":"http://batmat.net","github":"batmat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Baptiste has been using and contributing to Jenkins since it was called differently, and is a huge proponent of the Agile, Devops &amp; Continuous Delivery movements.\nHe loves to discuss not only the technical aspects, but also the even more essential cultural aspects of this all, working together to improve the value provided to customers in a great inclusive and blameless environment.</p>\n</div>","id":"batmat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Baptiste Mathus","slug":"/blog/authors/batmat","twitter":"bmathus"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3267c8fe-f10e-530a-9caa-bae9eeb34fb0","slug":"/blog/2016/12/31/what-a-year/","strippedHtml":"I do not think it is an exaggeration to say: 2016 was the best year yet for the\nJenkins project. Since the first commit in 2006, the project has reached a\nnumber of significant milestones in its ten years but we have never experienced\nthe breadth of major milestones in such a short amount of time. From\nJenkins 2\nand\nBlue Ocean\nto the\nGoogle Summer of Code\nand\nJenkins World,\n\nI wanted to take a moment and celebrate the myriad of accomplishments which\ncouldn’t have happened without the help from everybody who participates in the\nJenkins project. The 1,300+ contributors to the\njenkinsci GitHub organization,\nthe 4,000+ members of the\ndevelopers mailing list,\nthe 8,000+ members of the\nusers mailing list,\nand countless others who have reported issues, submitted pull requests, and\npresented at meetups and conferences.\n\nJenkins 2\n\nThrough the course of 2016, the Jenkins project published 16\nLTS releases\nand 54\nWeekly releases.\nOf those 70 releases, the most notable may have been the\nJenkins 2.0 release\nwhich was published in April.\n\nJenkins 2 made Pipeline as Code front-and-center in the user experience,\nintroduced a new \"Getting Started\" experience, and included a number of other\nsmall UI improvements, all while maintaining backwards compatibility with\nexisting Jenkins environments.\n\nSince April, we have released a number of LTS\nreleases using Jenkins 2 as a baseline, meaning the Jenkins project no longer\nmaintains any 1.x release lines.\n\nThe\nPipeline\nefforts have continuted to gain steam since April, covered on this blog with a\nnumber of\nposts tagged \"pipeline\". Closing out 2016 with the\nannouncement of the beta for\nDeclarative Pipeline syntax\nwhich is expected in early 2017.\n\nBlue Ocean\n\nHot on the heels of Jenkins 2 announcement\"Blue Ocean, a new user experience for Jenkins\",\nwas\nopen sourced in May.\nBlue Ocean is a new project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins.\nDesigned from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline and compatible with Freestyle\njobs. The goal for the project is to reduce clutter and increase clarity for\nevery member of a team using Jenkins.\n\nThe Blue Ocean beta can be installed from the Update Center and can be run in\nproduction Jenkins environments alongside the existing UI. It adds the new user experience under\n/blue in the environment but does not disturb the existing UI.\n\nBlue Ocean is expected to reach \"1.0\" in the first half of 2017.\n\nAzure\n\nAlso in May of 2016, the Jenkins project announced an exciting\nPartnership with Microsoft\nto run our project infrastructure on\nAzure. While the migration of Jenkins project\ninfrastructure into Azure is still on-going, there have been some notable\nmilestones reached already:\n\nEnd-to-end TLS encrypted delivery for Debian/openSUSE/Red Hat repositories which are\nconfigured to use https://pkg.jenkins.io by the end-user.\n\nMajor capacity improvements to\nci.jenkins.io\nproviding on-demand Ubuntu and Windows build/test infrastructure.\n\nA full continuous delivery Pipeline for all Azure-based infrastructure using\nTerraform from Jenkins.\n\nThe migration to Azure is expected to complete in 2017.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nFor the first time in the history of the project, Jenkins was accepted into\nGoogle Summer of Code\n2016. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual, international, program\nwhich encourages college-aged students to participate with open source projects\nduring the summer break between classes. Students accepted into the program\nreceive a stipend, paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or\nenhance the Jenkins project.\n\nIn exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteered as \"mentors\" for\nstudents to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed in\ncompleting their summer projects.\n\nA lot was learned during the summer which we look forward to applying to Google\nSummer of Code 2017\n\nJenkins World\n\nIn September, over one thousand people attended\nJenkins World,\nin Santa Clara, California.\n\nFollowing the event,\nLiam\nposted a series of blog posts which highlight some of the fantastic content\nshared by Jenkins users and contributors from around the world, such as:\n\nThe demos from the \"Experts\"\n\nSessions on Scaling Jenkins\n\nUsing Jenkins Pipeline\n\nThe Contributor Summit\n\nJenkins World was the first global event of its kind for Jenkins, it brought users\nand contributors together to exchange ideas on the current state of the\nproject, celebrate accomplishments of the past year, and look ahead at all the\nexiting enhancements coming down the pipe(line).\n\nIt was such a smashing success that\nJenkins World 2017\nis already scheduled for August 30-31st in San Francisco, California.\n\nJAM\n\nFinally, 2016 saw tremendous growth in the number of\nJenkins Area Meetups\n(JAMs) hosted around the world. JAMs are local meetups intended to bring\nJenkins users and contributors together for socializing and learning. JAMs are\norganized by local Jenkins community members who have a passion for sharing new\nJenkins concepts, patterns and tools.\n\nDriven by current Jenkins Events Officer,\nAlyssa Tong,\nand the dozens of passionate organizers, JAMs have become a great way to meet\nother Jenkins users near you.\n\nWhile we don’t yet have JAMs on each of the seven continents, you can always join the\nJenkins Online Meetup.\nThough we’re hoping more groups will be founded near you in 2017!\n\nI am personally grateful for the variety and volume of contributions made by\nthousands of people to the Jenkins project this year. I believe I can speak for\nproject founder,\nKohsuke Kawaguchi,\nin stating that the Jenkins community has grown beyond our anything we could\nhave imagined five years ago, let alone ten!\n\nThere are number of ways to\nparticipate\nin the Jenkins project, so if you didn’t have an opportunity to join in during\n2016, we hope to see you next year!","title":"Thank you for an amazing 2016","tags":["jam","jenkins2","pipeline","blueocean","azure","gsoc","new-year-blogpost"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

We had a number of\nexcellent events hosted around the world this November with plenty of great\nstories and presentations shared by the various members of the world-wide\nJenkins community.\n\nMelbourne, Australia JAM\n\nMelbourne JAM leaders,\nRaisa\nand\nBhuva\nhosted Blue Ocean for the inaugural meeting. Attendees learned the values of\nBlue Ocean, a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modeling\nand presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information that\nis important to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still\nstaying true to the extensibility that Jenkins always has had as a core value.\nThank you James Dumay for stopping by to take part in\nthe inauguration.\n\nSingapore, Singapore JAM\n\nOne of the members  who had several years of experience using Jenkins (since\nHudson days in fact) to present some basics on Continuous Integration with\nGitHub. It was targeted at new members who are starting out with Jenkins. We\nunderstand that we cannot always serve advanced topics to cater to the\nexperienced users and neglect the newbies so this session was targeted to help\ngive new users an introduction to Jenkins. It went well with about 15-20\nattendees and we hope to run some hands-on workshops in 2017. Some members were\nlooking forward to freebies like stickers and T-shirts too!\n\nMoscow, Russia JAM\n\nMoscow JAM leaders,\nKirill Tolkachev\nand\nOleg Nenashev\nled the inaugural meeting with\na packed full agenda. Oleg began the meeting with an update on Jenkins 2 what improvements users can expect and what\nenhancements are in the works within the Jenkins project. Following Oleg, Kirill shared\nhow his team in Alfa Laboratory used Jenkins to improve CD/DevOps in their\nprojects (with Jenkins Pipeline, Job DSL and\nBlue Ocean), the problems they experienced and how they fixed them. Then Oleg talked\nabout Jenkins Pipeline internals, main features and recent changes in the\necosystem. It was followed up by a discussion of large-scale Jenkins instances\nat the after-party.\n\nThe recording of the event can be found\non YouTube.\n\nMilan, Italy JAM\n\nThe first meetup was a great opportunity to meet local Jenkins fans to learn\nand share Jenkins experiences at a local cafe.\n\nSan Francisco, California JAM\n\nR. Tyler Croy\nperformed a 30 minutes live Pipeline coding demo to a relatively novice\naudience (though all had used Jenkins). A good amount of questions from the\naudience  which conveyed an appetite for the content being presented.\nRyan Wallner,\npresenter from ClusterHQ, also gave a demo based around Pipeline talking about\nClusterHQ’s \"Fli\" integration with a delivery pipeline.\n\nWashington, DC JAM\n\nThere was a fantastic 90% showup rate at this month’s meetup - 58 RSVPs and 52\nin attendance was pretty impressive. All this may be due to Fannie Mae’s story\n- the success of how they used Jenkins for CI/CD as part of their DevOps\nadoption. Afterwards, there was a lot of interests and further discussions\ntaking place. Next month’s host will be Freddie Mac.\n\nSeattle, Washington JAM\n\nLong time Jenkins community member and Seattle JAM leader,\nKhai Do showed how OpenStack uses \"Jenkins Job\nBuilder\" to manage and run thousands of Jenkins jobs per day in their\nmulti-controller CI/CD system.  He also compared\nJenkins Job Builder\nwith other Jenkins \"Infrastructure-as-code\" technologies - Jenkins Pipeline and\nJenkins JobDSL. It was followed by an in-depth Q&A and discussion session.\n\nDallas/Forth Worth, Texas (DFW) JAM\n\nThe November DFW JAM was the most strongly attended of the year!
