It was\nan amazing experience getting to meet people from all over world who are trying\nto make the development and release process easier and more efficient. I enjoyed\nlearning more about industry tools, processes, and standards, and meeting CI/CD\nexperts and contributors in the open source community.\n\nBelow is a summary of my experience. Thank you to the Jenkins project and CloudBees for making\n my trip and attendance possible!\n\nDay 1\n\nMonday was the Continuous Delivery Contributor Summit, which focused on projects\nunder the CDF umbrella.  After checking in and grabbing my badge, I was able to\nmeet up with some of the Google Summer of Code org admins. It was great\nbeing able to actually meet them in person after talking to them over video\nconferencing and chats all summer!\n\nTracy Miranda started the summit out by introducing the Continuous Delivery Foundation,\nwhich aims to provide a vendor neutral home to help and sustain open source projects\nfocusing on all aspects of continuous delivery.  Currently, Jenkins, Tekton, Spinnaker,\nand JenkinsX have joined the foundation.  Project updates were given for Jenkins,\nTekton, and JenkinsX.  In the afternoon, attendees split into different groups for\nunconference sessions.  I presented my project to the Jenkins group.  Afterwards,\nthere was free time to chat with other attendees about my project and the other Jenkins\nprojects. Lastly, lightning talks were given before everyone headed to the contributor\nappreciation event to grab some food and drinks.\n\nDay 2\n\nI attended the Jenkins Pipeline Fundamentals Short Course in the morning. Even\nthough I’m working on a project for Jenkins, there’s still a lot I don’t know so\nI just wanted to try to learn more.\n\nA lot of the afternoon sessions filled up, so I spent the afternoon trying to meet\nother people at the conference, before heading to the keynote. The keynote\ntalked more about the CDF and some of the backstory behind its origin.  This year is also a big anniversary for Jenkins - it has now been\naround for 15 years.\n\nAfter the keynote, I checked out a Women in Tech mixer and\nthe opening of the exibition hall. Probably my favorite swag I picked up was the\n\"Will Code for Beer\" stickers and a bottle of hot sauce.\n\nDay 3\n\nThe morning began with another keynote. Shawn Ahmed of CloudBees talked about the\nchallenges of visibility into bottlenecks of the development process and Rajeev Mahajan\ndiscussed how HSBC tackled DevOps.  The rest of the day I attended different sessions\non container tooling, implementing CI/CD in a cloud native environment, running\nJenkins on Jenkins, and database DevOps.\n\nAfter the sessions finished, I wandered\naround the expo until it closed, then joined some of the other conference attendees\nto have some fun at a ping pong bar nearby.\n\nDay 4\n\nThe final and last day of the conference was probably my favorite.  The morning\nkeynote revealed that Zhao Xiaojie had won an award for his work on Jenkins advocacy,\nsome other DevOps award panelists talked about their approaches to different challenges,\nthen David Stanke gave an enjoyable presentation about cloud native CI/CD. I was\nable to present my summer project and attend a few more sessions, including one\nabout DevOps at scale, and another about use cases for machine learning in CI/CD pipelines.\n\nThe last keynote given by James Governor was a thoughtful look into the current and\nfuture states of tech. How does tech look like it will scale in the coming years\nin the U.S. and across the world? How can we make tech more inclusive and accessible?\nWhat can we do to minimize our environmental footprint?  In particular, his points\non welcoming people from a non-traditional computer science background resonated with\nme since I’m currently undergoing my own career transition to tech.\n\nAfter the conference ended, I said goodbye to the remaining GSoC org admins before\nmeeting an old friend for dinner and bringing along some new friends I met at the\nconference.  I spent the remaining part of the night singing karaoke with\nthem before heading out of San Francisco the next morning.\n\nThanks again to everyone who supported me and encouraged me leading up to and during\nmy presentation, patiently answered my questions as I tried to gather more context\nabout CI/CD tools and practices, and made my first DevOps conference so enjoyable!","title":"My DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 Experience","tags":["pluginmanagement","devopsworld2019","gsoc","gsoc2019","community","events"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#280818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/405b9/stopalopa.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7b6be/stopalopa.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/ebcfb/stopalopa.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/0ade5/stopalopa.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/5b0b1/stopalopa.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/96834/stopalopa.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/805f6/stopalopa.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":184}}},"blog":null,"github":"stopalopa","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Natasha is a Master&#8217;s student at Penn State University.

In particular, we’ve been focusing on getting the tool ready to\nincorporate into the Jenkins Docker Image to replace the\ninstall-plugins.sh bash script\nto download plugins.  This work included parsing improvements so that blank lines and comments in the\nplugins.txt file are filtered out, allowing update centers and the plugin download\ndirectory to be set via environment variables or CLI Options, creating Windows\ncompatible defaults, and fixing a bug in which dependencies for specific\nplugin versions were not always getting resolved correctly.\n\nIn parallel to getting the tool ready for Jenkins Docker integration, Phase 2 saw\nthe addition of several new features.\n\nYaml Input\n\nIn addition to specifying the plugins they want to download via the --plugins\nCLI option or through a .txt file, users can now use a Jenkins yaml file with a\nplugins root element.\n\nSay goodbye to the days of specifying incremental\nplugins like incrementals;org.jenkins-ci.plugins.workflow;2.20-rc530.b4f7f7869384 -\n  you can enter the artifactId, groupId, and version to specify an incremental plugin.\n\nMaking the Download Process More Transparent\n\nPreviously, the plugin download process was not very transparent to users - it was\ndifficult to know the final set of plugins that would be downloaded after pulling in\nall the dependencies.  Instead of determing the set of plugins that will be downloaded\nat the time of download, users now have the option to see the full set of plugins\nand their versions that will be downloaded in advance. With the --list CLI\noption, users can see all currently downloaded and bundled plugins, the set of all\nplugins that will be downloaded, and the effective plugin set - the set of all\nplugins that are already downloaded or will be downloaded.\n\nViewing Information About plugins\n\nNow that you know which plugins will be downloaded, wouldn’t it be nice to know\nif these are the latest versions or if any of the versions you want to install have\nsecurity warnings?  You can do that now too.\n\nNext Steps and Additional Information\n\nThe updates mentioned in this blog will be released soon so you can try them out.\nThe focus of Phase 3 will be to continue to iterate upon and improve the library\nand CLI. We hope to release a first version and submit a pull request to Jenkins Docker soon.\nThanks to everyone who has already tried it out and given feedback! I will also be\npresenting my work at DevOps World\nin San Francisco in a few weeks.  You can use the code PREVIEW for a discounted registration\n($799 instead of $1,499).\n\nFeel free to reach out through\nthe Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list. I would love to get your questions, comments, and feedback!\nWe have meetings Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6PM UTC.\n\nPhase 2 Presentation Slides\n\nPhase 2 Recorded Demo\n\nJira Issue Search\n\nRepository","title":"Plugin Management Library and CLI Tool Phase 2 GSoC Updates","tags":["plugins","pluginmanagement","platform-sig","cli","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#280818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/405b9/stopalopa.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7b6be/stopalopa.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/7f211/stopalopa.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/ebcfb/stopalopa.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/0ade5/stopalopa.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/5b0b1/stopalopa.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/96834/stopalopa.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/55656e58d7dc5462c696501b0b08bd16/805f6/stopalopa.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":184}}},"blog":null,"github":"stopalopa","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Natasha is a Master&#8217;s student at Penn State University.

We instead decided to start by converting the\ninstall-plugins.sh bash script in Jenkins Docker to Java.\nThere are several issues with the install-plugins.sh script - namely, that it is a bash script and has limited extensibility.\nFurthermore, it does not retrieve all of the most-up-to-date update center metadata.\n\nAlpha Release Details\n\nMimicking what was done in the install-plugins.sh script from the official Jenkins Docker image, the new plugin management library takes in a list of plugins, their versions,\nand/or urls from which to download the plugins, and downloads the requested plugins and their dependencies. The plugins are downloaded from the update center\nto a specified directory, and can then be loaded into Jenkins. Currently, the plugins to be downloaded can be specified via a plugins.txt file and/or the -plugins cli option, but we plan to further expand the input formats that can be accepted.\nCustom version specifiers for different update centers are also supported.\n\nThe library will first check if any of the requested plugins are currently either installed in the user-specified download location or user-specified Jenkins war file.\nAlready installed plugins will be ignored or upgraded if a higher version is requested or required as a dependency.  After determining the plugin download URL, the library\nwill download the plugins and resolve and download their dependencies.\n\nThis is just the beginning: the plugin manager library and cli tool are very much still a work in progress.\nFor the most up-to-date information on CLI options and how to run the tool, see the repository README.md.\nMore robust input parsing, support for security warnings and available updates, Docker integration, and additional features coming soon!\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nFeel free to reach out through\nthe Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool Gitter chat or through\nthe Jenkins Developer Mailing list.
