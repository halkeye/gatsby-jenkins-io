joint blog post prepared by the Java 11 Support Team: Adrien Lecharpentier, Ashton Treadway, Baptiste Mathus, Jenn Briden, Kevin Earls, María Isabel Vilacides, Mark Waite, Ramón León and Oleg Nenashev.\n\nWe have worked hard for this and it’s now here.\nWe are thrilled to announce full support for Java 11 in Jenkins starting from Jenkins 2.164 (released on Feb 10, 2019) and LTS 2.164.1 (ETA: March 14th).\nThis means you can now run your Jenkins controllers and agents with a Java 11 JVM.\n\nStarting in June 2018, many events were organized to improve Jenkins code base and add Java 11 support.\nBeyond these events, Core/Plugins maintainers and many other contributors have worked hard to make sure they discover and solve as many issues as possible related to Java 11 support.\n\nThe effort to support Java 11 led to the creation of the JEP-211: Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nIt also spurred the creation of the Platform Special Interest Group to coordinate the Java 11 work and other platform support efforts.\n\nCelebration\n\nWe’d like to take a moment to thank everyone involved in these tasks: code contributors, issue reporters, testers, event planners and attendees and all those in the community who have generously lent their time and support to this effort.\nThank you all!\n\nHere are some of the contributors who helped with this task (alphabetical order):\n\nAlex Earl,\nAlyssa Tong,\nAshton Treadway,\nBaptiste Mathus,\nCarlos Sanchez,\nDaniel Beck,\nDavid Aldrich,\nDenis Digtyar,\nDevin Nusbaum,\nEmeric Vernat,\nEvaristo Gutierrez,\nGavin Mogan,\nGianpaolo

Hafner,\nVincent Latombe,\nWadeck Follonier\n\n(We are deeply sorry if we missed anyone in this list.)\n\nGuidelines\n\nIn order to keep it simple, here is how you can start Jenkins on Java 11 using the Docker image.\nYou can select a Java 11 based image by suffixing the tag of the image with -jdk11.\nIf you are upgrading an existing instance please read the Upgrading Jenkins Java version from 8 to 11 page before upgrading.\n\nSo you can run Jenkins on Java 11 with:\n\ndocker run -p 50000:50000 -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:2.164-jdk11\n\nHowever, and as always, you can still start Jenkins with other methods.\nPlease see the more detailed documentation at Running Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nDeveloper guidelines\n\nFor developers involved in Jenkins development, you can find details on developing and testing Jenkins to run on Java 11 on the Java 11 Developer Guidelines.\n\nThis resource regroups the modifications which might need to be done in order to validate the compatibility of plugins for Java 11.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nEven though this is a big achievement, we still have work to do.\n\nOur first priority is adding Java 11 support to JenkinsFile Runner project.\nFrom there, we will move on to port Java 11 support to the Jenkins X project and the Evergreen project.\n\nSo, even if this is a big deal to us, this is not the end of the story.\nIt is a major step that will benefit users, developers, and members of the Jenkins community.\n\nReference links\n\nRunning Jenkins on Java

refer to Running Jenkins on Java 11 documentation to have the up-to-date details on how to run Jenkins on Java 11.\n\nThis is a joint blogpost prepared by the Java 11 Support Team.\nOn Dec 18 (4PM UTC) we will be also presenting the Java 11 Preview Support at the Jenkins Online Meetup\n( link)\n\nJenkins, one of the leading open-source automation servers, still supports only Java 8.\nOn September 25 OpenJDK 11 was released.\nThis is a Long-Term-Support which will stay around for years,\nand in the Jenkins project we are interested to offer a full support of this version.\nOver the last year many contributors have been working towards enabling support for Java 11 in the project (Jenkins JEP-211).\nIt was a thorny path,\nbut now, on behalf of the Jenkins Platform SIG,\nwe are happy to announce preview availability of Java 11 support in Jenkins weekly releases!\n\nWhy do we need preview availability for Java 11?\nIt offers Jenkins contributors and early adopters a way\nto try out the changes before the general availability release happens early next year.\nIt should help us to get more exploratory testing and, hopefully,\nresolve most of the issues before Java 11 is officially supported in Jenkins.\n\nIn this blog post we will describe how to run with Java 11,\nand how to investigate compatibility issues and report them.\n\nBackground\n\nAs you probably remember,\nin June 2018 we had an online hackathon targeting Java 10+ support in Jenkins.\nAs a part of the hackathon,\nwe provided the experimental support of Java 11.\nThis event was a big success for us,\nand we were able to get Jenkins running with Java 10 and 11-ea,\nincluding major features like Jenkins Pipeline, JobDSL, Docker/Kubernetes plugins, Configuration as Code, BlueOcean, etc.\nIt gave us confidence that we can provide Java 11 support in Jenkins without major breaking changes.\nAfter the hackathon, Oleg Nenashev created\njep:211[\"Java 10+ support in Jenkins\"] (was later adjusted to target Java 11 only).\nPlatform Special Interest Group\nhas been also founded to coordinate the Java 11 support work\nand other platform support efforts (packaging, operating system support, etc.).\n\nA group of contributors continued working on Java 11 support,\nmostly focusing on upstreaming functional patches,\nenabling Java 11 support in development tools,\ntesting and addressing known compatibility issues.\nSee the Platform SIG meeting notes for detailed status updates.\nStarting from Jenkins 2.148, Jenkins successfully runs with latest OpenJDK 11 releases on various Linux and Windows platforms.\nWe performed a LOT of automated and exploratory tests, Jenkins plugins appear to work well with some exceptions (see below).\nThere is ongoing test automation effort towards the GA releases,\nbut we were able to successfully run Jenkins core tests,\nfull Acceptance Test Harness,\nand Plugin Compat Tester for recommended plugins.\nWe also deployed a temporary\nExperimental Update Center for Java 11\nwhich allows quickly delivering fixes for Java 11 early adopters.\nJenkins 2.155+ defaults to this update center when running with Java 11,\nand that’s why we announce preview availability for this version.\n\nOn Nov 19, 2018 we presented the current Java 11 support status at the Platform SIG meeting\nslides,\nand we agreed that we would like to proceed with the preview availability so that\nwe can offer something for evaluation to Jenkins users.\nBy the next meeting on Dec 04, all blockers have been addressed,\nand the Platform SIG meeting signed off the Java 11 preview availability.\n\nRunning Jenkins and Java 11 in Docker\n\nStarting from Jenkins 2.155, we provide Docker images for the Jenkins controller and agent.\nAll these images are based on the official\nopenjdk:11-jdk image maintained by the Docker Community.\nThere were discussions about migrating to other base images,\nbut we decided to exclude it from the Preview Availability scope.\nSimilarly, we do not provide Alpine images for now.\n\nJenkins controller image\n\nJava 11 support is now provided as a part of the official\njenkins/jenkins image.\nYou can run the Jenkins with Java 11 simply as:\n\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:jdk11\n\nThe following tags are available:\n\njdk11 - Latest weekly release with Java 11 support\n\n2.155-jdk11 - Weekly releases packaged with Java 11\n\nThe image is fully compatible with\njenkins/jenkins documentation,\ne.g. you can use plugins.txt to install plugins, mount volumes and pass extra options via environment variables.\n\nAgent images\n\nIf you use containerized agents via Docker or Kubernetes plugins,\nwe have also released official Docker images for Jenkins agents:\n\njenkins/agent\n\njenkins/inbound-agent\n\njenkins/ssh-build-agent\n\nAll images use the latest-jdk11 image tag for JDK11 bundles.\nAnd sorry for the obsolete names!\n\nExperimental Jenkins controller images\n\nIn order to simplify testing, we also provide some experimental images on DockerHub.\nWe set up a continuous delivery flow for them,\nso you can get patches without waiting for Jenkins weekly releases.\n\njenkins4eval/blueocean-platform-support -\nEquivalent of jenkinsci/blueocean\n\nTag: latest-jdk11\n\nThe image bundles all Jenkins Pipeline and Blue Ocean patches required to run on Java 11\n\nIf you want to try Pipeline, use this image\n\njenkins/jenkins-experimental -\nEquivalent of jenkins/jenkins\n\nTag: latest-jdk11\n\nThe image is released from the java11-support feature branch in the Jenkins core\n\nThe branch may be slightly ahead or behind the master branch,\nwe may use the branch to quickly deliver patches to Java 11 users\n\nEventually we will move the experimental flow to the new jenkins4eval organization\nbeing created as a part of jep:217[].\n\nRunning jenkins.war with Java 11\n\nRunning without Docker is not that trivial,\nbecause Jenkins depends on some modules which have been removed from Java 11.\nWe plan to address it in the General Availability release somehow (see jira:JENKINS-52186[]),\nbut for now some manual actions are required to run Jenkins WAR with Java 11.\n\nDownload Jenkins WAR for 2.155\n\nDownload the following libraries to the same directory as jenkins.war\n\njaxb-api-2.3.0.jar (save as jaxb-api.jar)\n\njaxb-core-2.3.0.1.jar (save as jaxb-core.jar)\n\njaxb-impl-2.3.0.1.jar (save as jaxb-impl.jar)\n\njavax.activation v.1.2.0 (save as javax.activation.jar)\n\nRun the following command:\n\nRun Jenkins with ${JAVA11_HOME}/bin/java \\\n    -p jaxb-api.jar:javax.activation.jar --add-modules java.xml.bind,java.activation \\\n    -cp jaxb-core.jar:jaxb-impl.jar \\\n    -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java --httpPort=8080 --prefix=/jenkins\n\nKnown compatibility issues\n\nTo help users to track down the compatibility issues,\nwe have created a new Known Java 11 Compatibility Issues Wiki page.\n\nSeveral important issues and obstacles:\n\nPipeline: Support Plugin has a known issue\nwith context persistency when running with Java 11 (jira:JENKINS-51998[])\n\nWe have deployed a temporary fix to the\nExperimental Update Center for Java 11.\n Fix version: 3.0-java11-alpha-1\n\nIf you use Jenkins Pipeline, make sure you run with this fix.\nOtherwise the jobs will fail almost immediately\n\nWhen updating instances to Java 11, make sure there is no running Pipelines\n\njira:JENKINS-54305[] -\nJDK Tool Plugin does not offer installers for JDK 11\n\njira:JENKINS-52282[] -\nJava Web Start is no longer available in Java 11, so it is no longer possible to start agents from Web UI.\nWe do not plan to provide a replacement.\n\nWe also know about some minor incompatibilities in other plugins,\nbut we do not consider them as blockers for preview availability.\n\nReporting compatibility issues\n\nIf you discover any Java 11 incompatibilities, please\nreport issues in our bugtracker.\nPlease set java11-compatibility labels for such issues\nso that they automatically appear on the Wiki page and get triaged.\n\nFor the security issues please use the standard\nvulnerability reporting process.\nAlthough we will be fixing Java 11 specific issues in public while it is in the preview,\nfollowing the security process will help us to investigate impact on Java 8 users.\n\nJava 11 Support Team\n\nOnce Java 11 support is released, we expect reports of regressions in plugins and Jenkins core.\nOne of the concerns are exotic platforms with native libraries, and of course other Java versions.\nThere is also a risk of 3rd-party library incompatibilities with Java 11.\nTo mitigate the risks, we have created a\nJava 11 Support Team.\nThis team will be focusing on triaging the incoming issues,\nhelping to review pull requests and, in some cases, delivering the fixes.\nThe process for this team is documented in JEP-211.\n\nWe do not expect the Java 11 Support Team to be able to fix all discovered issues,\nand we will be working with Jenkins core and plugin maintainers to get the fixes delivered.\nIf you are interested to join the team,\nreach out to us in the Platform SIG Gitter Channel.\n\nContributing\n\nWe will appreciate any kind of contributions in the Java 11 effort,\nincluding trying out Jenkins with Java 11, reporting and fixing compatibility issues.\n\nIf you want to do the exploratory testing,\nwe recommend to try out Java 11 support at one of your test instances.\nSuch testing will be much appreciated,\nespecially if you use some service integration plugins or exotic platforms.\nThe issue reporting guidelines are provided above\n\nIf you are a plugin developer/maintainer,\nwe would appreciate if you could test your plugin with Java 11.\nIn order to help with that, we have created a Wiki page with\nJava 11 Developer guidelines.\nThis page explains how to build and test plugins with Java 11,\nand it also lists known issues in development tools\n\nWhatever you do, please let us know about your experience by sending a message to\nthe Platform SIG mailing list.\nSuch information will help us a lot to track changes and contributions.\nAny other feedback about the migration complexity will be appreciated!\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nOn Dec 18 (4PM UTC) we will be presenting the Java 11 Preview Support at the Jenkins Online Meetup\n( link).\nAt this meetup we will summarize the current Java 11 Preview support status.\nIf you are a plugin developer, we will also organize separate sessions about testing plugins with Java 11 and about common best practices for fixing compatibility issues.\nPlease follow the Platform SIG announcements if you are interested.\n\nIn the next weeks we will focus on addressing feedback from early adopters and\nfixing the discovered compatibility issues.\nWe will also continue working on Java 11 support patches towards the general availability next year (jira:JENKINS-51805[]).\nIn addition to that, we will start working on Java 11 support in subprojects,\nincluding Jenkins X and Jenkins Evergreen.\n\nLinks\n\nJEP-211: Java 11 support in Jenkins\n\nJava requirements in Jenkins\n\nKnown Java 11 Compatibility Issues\n\nJava 11 Developer guidelines\n\nPlatform Special Interest

week I participated in the\nJenkins & Java 10 Online Hackathon.\nIt was my first Jenkins hackathon and I roped in\nJonah Graham to do some pair-programming.\nThe hackathon featured JDK Project Jigsaw committers Mandy Chung and Paul Sandoz,\nas well as Jenkins creator Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\nIt was a great opportunity for me to learn a lot about Jenkins and Java 10.\n\nWhy Java 10?\n\nWith the\nJava 8 EoL data looming,\nthe focus was on the current available version of Java, Java 10.\nJava 10 offers some nice new features and APIs, not least\nimproved docker container integration.\nWe learned from Paul of a number of projects with Java 10 migration success stories including Elasticsearch, Kafka & Netty.\n\nAt the beginning of the hackathon week, the Jenkins Pipeline feature would crash out when using Java 10.\nThis was resolved with a number of fixes including the upgrade of the\nASM library.\nThen it was nice to see things\nup and running with Java 10.\n\nGetting up & running\n\nThe first steps were to do some exploratory testing using\nJenkins with Java 10 via Docker, thanks to\nOleg for providing clear instructions.\nThis was boringly straightforward as most things worked and we only found one\nissue to report.\nNext to try to get some patches in, we needed to set-up a dev environment.\nThe live session gave us what we needed to set up a\nplugin or\ncore dev environment.\nOne open question we had was whether Jenkins has semantic versioning and\nAPI tools\nto help identify when you might be breaking backwards compatibility.\nOverall it was straightforward to get a dev environment up and running.\n\nJava 10 New APIs\n\nThe next step was to find an issue which we could help resolve.\nMany of the Java 10 issues were related to 'Illegal reflective access' from various plugins or third-party libraries.\nHowever after investigating a couple, removing these warnings required a good architectural knowledge of the plugin or core code itself.\nIn the end we decided that messing around with classloaders or attempting to upgrade version of jdom was not one for the newbies.\n\nInstead we looked at\nremoving reflection\nin cases of isAccessible calls.\nWe found the\nProcessHandle\napi very useful and a good replacement for some misuse of reflection, and even better it made the code work on Windows too.\nMandy also pointed us to look at the\nLookup api\nas possible alternate to findClass calls.\n\nMulti-Release JAR Builds\n\nUsing new APIs is all well and good but presents a problem when you want to maintain backwards compatibility with Java 8.\nHence the need for some sort of multi-jar solution -\nNicolas De loof proposed one such solution for\nmulti-release jars with Maven for this case.\n\nsun.misc.Signal\n\nThe Java Signal API is being deprecated, but so far no replacement APIs\nare available for signal handling.\nJenkins makes use of the Signal APIs so a big question for the Jigsaw team was whether this would be replaced going forward.\nKohsuke pointed out how it is important for Java to maintain this UNIX like behaviour as it shouldn’t matter to end users that Jenkins is written in Java.\nIt seems these APIs will be replaced in due course, they just\naren’t there right now.\n\nCollaboration, Collaboration, Collaboration\n\nIt was great to have the discussions with the Jigsaw team.\nThey reminded us how they need to know the Java use cases out there and how their team uses these to feed into their development process.\nIn turn, the hackathon had Jenkins community members participate, for instance\neasy-jenkins was up and running with Java 10 by the end of the week.\nThe hackathon had a great feeling of community spirit and was a reminder why collaborations with communities and also between different communities can be powerful and fun for all involved.\n\nAt the end of the week Jonah and I were both happy that we made our first Jenkins contributions (which were reviewed and merged quickly).\nThanks to all who participated and made it highly enjoyable, especially Oleg for great organization.\nI look forward to the next one!","title":"What I learned from the Jenkins & Java 10+

week we have a\nJenkins & Java 10 Online Hackathon.\nThis is an open online event, where we work together on Jenkins core and plugins in order\nto find and fix compatibility issues, share experiences and have some fun.\nEverybody is welcome to join, independently of their Jenkins experience and amount of time they have available.\n\nAfter the kick off on Monday\nJenkins contributors have been working on Java 10 and Java 11 support in Jenkins.\nWe have already received contributions from 12 hackathon participants, and the number keeps growing.\nThere are still 3 days ahead, but we have already achieved some important results we want to share.\n\nJenkins Pipeline\n\nOne of our major efforts over last 2 days was to get Jenkins Pipeline working on\nJava 10+.\nWhen the hackathon started Jenkins Pipeline was not working at all,\nand it was a major blocker for Java support and for exploratory testing in particular.\nWe’ve been working together with Sam van Oort and Devin Nusbaum to fix the libraries in\nthe Jenkins core, Pipeline: Support plugin and Docker packaging.\n\nJust to summarize the result of two days in one screenshot…​\n\nYes, we have got it running!\nOver two days we have got from the \"Pipeline Crashes Immediately\"\nstate to the situation when the most of key Pipeline features are operational,\nincluding Scripted and Declarative Pipeline, Blue Ocean, shared libraries and\ndozens of plugins being used in the Jenkins plugin build flow.\n\nThere is still a lot of work to do to get the changes finalized,\nbut Jenkins Pipeline is available for testing on Java 10 and 11 now.\nIf you want to try it out, you can use a new jenkins/jenkins-experimental:blueocean-jdk10\nimage we have created.\nIt bundles all the required patches, so you can just run the following command to get started:\n\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins-experimental:blueocean-jdk10\n\nIf you want to try more complex scenarions, see the\nRunning Jenkins with Java 10 and 11 blogpost\nand List of Required patches.\n\nWhat else?\n\nAlthough Pipeline is the most visible change,\nthere are other ongoing activities:\n\nDevin Nusbaum explored plugin startup issues we had with JDK 11ea+17\nand confirmed that we need to upgrade our images to JDK 11ea+18\n\nGianpaolo Macario is working on adopting the Java 10 experimental images in his\neasy-jenkins project\n\nSam van Oort and Devin Nusbaum are working on getting plugin build and test flows\nwhen using JDK 10 with Maven\n\nNicolas de Loof is working on cleaning up Illegal reflective access warnings in Jenkins components,\nusing the new Fields micro-library\n\nOlivier Lamy and Nicolas de Loof are updating the\nAnimal Sniffer plugin for Maven\nto make it compatible with Java 9 and above\n\nKohsuke Kawaguchi has released a repackaged version of ASM 6.2 we use in the project\n\nLast but not least, Liam Newman and Tracy Miranda helped us a lot to run the meetings\nand to get this hackathon organized\n\nThere are also other contributors working on exploratory testing and reporting\ndefects they discover.\nSee our status doc\nfor the full list.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTomorrow we will have 2 sessions:\n\nAt 8AM UTC we will have a sync-up.\nAccording to the requests from hackathon paticipants, we will have an intro session to Jenkins development for newcomers\n\nYouTube link\n\nAt 4PM UTC we will have a meeting with key JDK Project Jigsaw committers\n\nMark Reinhold, Mandy Chung and Paul Sandoz will join us to talk about\nJava 10/11 adoption\n\nYouTube link\n\nWe will also post participant links in our Gitter channel\n15 minutes before the meetings.\nIf you have any questions, please join the meetings or raise questions in the chat during the call.\n\nCan I

achieved the following state:\n\nJenkins 2.127+ starts up successfully with\nOpenJDK 10.0.1 and\nOpenJDK 11+17-Debian-2 (preview)\n\nIt is possible to configure and run simple Freestyle jobs\n\nJenkins agents are able to start on Java 10, to connect to the controller and to execute Freestyle jobs\n\nAgents can be connected using Docker Plugin and Yet Another Docker Plugin\n\nJob DSL plugin works well on demo projects\n\nMaven Integration plugin can build\nplugin-pom -based\nJenkins plugins when running on agents with JDK 8\n\nIt is possible to create Folders and manage items in them\n\nIt is possible to configure Jenkins using Configuration-as-Code plugin\n\nJenkins is able to execute Groovy scripts in Script Console and\nGroovy Hooks\n\nKnown issues\n\nSo far we know about the following issues:\n\nPipeline crashes immediately on Java 10 and 11 ( JENKINS-46602)\n\nWorkaround: Pipeline: Support plugin should be updated to version 3.0-java11-alpha-1-rc684.d802f5d9aeed from the Incrementals repo\n( download)\n\nFIXED - Git Client plugin 2.7.2 cannot be installed when running with Java 11 build 18ea\n\nThere are many warnings about Illegal reflective access during execution\n(linked in JENKINS-40689).\n\nIn current Java 10 and 11 releases it does not lead to failures,\nbut we want to cleanup these warnings anyway\n\nFIXED - Configuration-as-Code plugin fails to export configurations on Java 10\n( JENKINS-51991)\n\nWe anticipate to discover and report more issues during the hackathon this week.\n\nContributing\n\nIf you discover incompatibilities in plugins, please\nreport issues in our bugtracker.\nWe have java10 and java11 labels for such issues.\n\nIf you are interested to try out Jenkins with Java 10 and 11 before June 22nd,\nyou may be interested to sign-up to the Jenkins and Java 10+ online hackathon.\nEverybody is welcome to join, independently of their Jenkins experience and amount of time they have available.\nExploratory testing is also within the hackathon’s scope.\nDuring this event, please also use the java10_hackathon label.\nIt will help us to track contributions and send folks some small \"thank you\" gifts for participating (details will be figured out during the hackathon).\n\nIf you want to contribute patches to the core,\nplease submit pull requests to java10-support or\njava11-support branches.\nIf the patches are compatible with Java 8, we will try to upstream them to weekly releases.\nFor plugin patches please create pull requests against main branches and then follow guidelines from plugin maintainers.\nIf you need additional reviews and you are a member of the jenkinsci organization,\nfeel free to mention the @jenkinsci/java10-support team in your PRs.\n\nLinks:\n\nDocker: jenkins/jenkins-experimental

behalf of the Jenkins Events Team,\nI would like to invite you to the “Jenkins & Java 10 Online Hackathon” which will take place from June 18th to 22nd.\nWe will be working together on Jenkins core and plugins in order\nto find and fix compatibility issues, share experiences and have some fun.\nEverybody is welcome to join, independently of their Jenkins experience and amount of time they have available.\n\nIf you are interested in participating in the hackathon, please sign-up in\nthis form.\n\nBackground\n\nJava 9 has recently been end-of-lifed, Java 10 is in GA, and Java 11 is in early beta.\nJenkins project currently requires Java 8 to run reliably,\nand there are some known compatibility issues with higher Java versions.\n\nDuring the Jenkins World 2017 Hackathon,\nMark Waite and\nBaptiste Mathus spent some time exploring Java 9 compatibility in Jenkins.\nWe are currently tracking compatibility issues in the\nJENKINS-40689 EPIC,\nbut there are likely many unknown issues in Jenkins core, plugins and in libraries we use in the project.\nWe would like to continue their effort and work on Java 10+ support.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nAs I have said above,\nthe goals are to explore/fix compatibility issues, share experiences and have fun.\nWe DO NOT plan to make Jenkins fully compatible with Java 10+\nduring the hackathon,\nbut we will try to integrate fixes and make them available.\n\nSince the announcement of the Hackathon in the mailing list,\nwe have got a number of registrations from contributors working on several project areas.\nWe will split our work to several areas:\n\nJenkins core and Remoting\n\nPipeline Engine\n\nPlugins (e.g. Git plugin or any plugin you want to work on)\n\nExploratory testing for Java 10 and beyond\n\nIn order to organize the effort, we have created a\njava10_hackathon label\nin Jenkins JIRA.\nIf you are interested in particular tasks,\nplease assign them to yourself and add the label.\n\nOrganization\n\nCurrently the event is in the planning stage.\nWe will be using the Developer mailing list\nfor synchronization before the event.\n\nWhat will we have?\n\nCommunications in #jenkins-hackhouse IRC and in the\nJenkins Gitter channel\n\nDaily recorded sync-up calls in Hangouts\n\nKnowledge transfer sessions during the event\n\nWe also want to prepare some special swag for active participants.\nIf you have reached this part of the blogpost,\nyou have probably seen the logo ;)\n\nLinks\n\nRegistration\n\nDeveloper mailing list\n\nHackathon sync-up document\n\nRunning Jenkins with Java 10 and
