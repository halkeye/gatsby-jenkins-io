We’ll be talking about Jenkins, maybe doing some coding, and then heading out for drinks and more talk! You can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA few days later, TNG Technology Consulting is generously hosting a meetup in Munich, on Wednesday, June 30th, starting at 3pm. I’ll be giving a quick talk on the state of the Jenkins project, followed by Ullrich Haffner (the author of the static analysis plugins for Jenkins) giving a quick talk on how those plugins are used. After that, we’ll be having a hackathon, and then more beer! Again, you can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA week later, the London CI meetup group is hosting a meetup as well, on Wednesday, July 6th, starting at 6:30pm. We’ll be meeting up at the Royal Festival Hall for discussion and drinking.

More than half of the total votes were from ineligible voters, but the result would have been the same either way. The final result of all eligible votes is as follows: 214 votes to rename, and 14 for the status quo. You can see the individual votes hudson-jenkins-vote.\nSo what does this mean now? Well, it means Jenkins lives. We’ve registered jenkins-ci.org, though it’s empty at the moment. In the coming days, we will be renaming the existing Google Groups to jenkins-*@googlegroups.com, renaming the Twitter account from @hudsonci to @jenkinsci, and renaming our organization at Github from hudson to jenkinsci. I wanted to make sure everyone had notice ahead of time that this was happening, so that no one gets surprised by changes to their incoming mail, etc. As said before, the initial, interim governance board will consist of me, Kohsuke and, if he and Oracle are willing, Winston. If Winston is unwilling or unable to continue in that role with Jenkins, we will select a replacement interim member. The interim board will work on the details of a more permanent governance process going forward. Discussions on the infrastructure changes (including things like the Maven groupId/artifactIds, etc) will be in public, on these lists. We’re working to get the JIRA and wiki contents migrated over to the Jenkins site, and hope to work with Oracle to get that done in the next couple days.\n\nPutting aside logistics, I want to personally thank everyone for voting, and especially thank everyone who voted for renaming for supporting the Jenkins project and its future.

While talks have been ongoing, the holidays have slowed\nthings down, and we didn’t want to send out information that would later turn\nout not to be true. We’ve been waiting for the talks to reach a resolution -\nand I believe they now have.\n\nSince the java.net migration problems, Oracle and representatives from the\nHudson community have been involved in talks on the future of the project in a\nnumber of areas. The Hudson representatives have been myself, Kohsuke\nKawaguchi, and Sacha Labourey (CEO of CloudBees and Kohsuke’s boss), who was\nbrought in to help provide experience with discussions on a corporate/executive\nlevel which neither Kohsuke nor I have, with Alan Harder and R. Tyler Croy\nadvising on the side.\n\nThese talks have in many ways been fruitful - we came to working agreements\nwith Oracle on the project infrastructure (such as mailing lists and SCM\nrepository location), code review policy for Hudson core, and perhaps most\nsignificantly, a governance structure for the project going forward. Some\nissues are not yet entirely resolved, such as questions on restrictions on\nthird party dependency licenses. But one issue, which we feel is the most\nsignificant issue of all, one for which we now believe no resolution is\npossible: the rights to the name Hudson.\n\nOracle has told us that they have trademark applications filed in both the EU\nand US for Hudson, based on Hudson’s creation by Kohsuke while working at Sun.\nThe problem is that this trademark ownership gives Oracle the ability to revoke\nthe Hudson project’s right to call itself Hudson at any time, and while Oracle\nhas made an attempt to offer some guarantees (most notably, that binary\nreleases of Hudson, once they’ve been released with the name Hudson attached,\nwill always retain the right to the name), they are not offering any binding\nguarantee that the Hudson project will be able to retain its use of the name in\nperpetuity.\n\nTherefore, to continue using the name Hudson means ceding some of the project’s\nindependence to Oracle - if the project and its governance board opted to go in\na direction Oracle disapproved of, Oracle would be able to take away the naming\nrights. Or, in a less dramatic scenario, Oracle could insist on certain changes\nto the code, infrastructure decisions, process, etc, regardless of opposition\nfrom the Hudson development community, in order to retain the rights to the\nname.\n\nIn short, we’d be living under a sword of Damocles, regardless of the goodwill\nof the individuals we’ve been negotiating with at Oracle - Hudson as a project\nwould be beholden to Oracle’s whims for its continued use of its own name, and\nwe believe that’s not viable.\nAs I see it, the only viable option facing the project now is to rename it, in\norder to free it from the burden of Oracle’s ownership of its name. This is not\na first choice, not by a long shot, but I don’t see any other choice available\nto us that would preserve the integrity of the project going forward. Oracle\nwill be presenting their proposal for the project continuing under their\numbrella - I encourage you to read it when it becomes available and weigh it\naccordingly. I’ll just focus on what Kohsuke, other prominent Hudson community\nmembers and I have endorsed.\n\nThe Proposal\n\nFirst, we rename the project - the choice for a new name is Jenkins, which we\nthink evokes the same sort of English butler feel as Hudson. We’ve already\nregistered domains, Twitter users, etc for the new name, and have done our best\nto verify that there are no existing trademarks which would conflict with it.\nKohsuke will be registering the trademark for Jenkins in his name, with the\nintent of transferring ownership of the trademark to the umbrella of the\nSoftware Freedom Conservancy once the Jenkins project has been admitted to it\n(which, I should add, is very much our plan, hopefully in their next round of\nnew projects in a few months - we’ve already had preliminary contacts with\nSFC). We still invite Oracle to remain involved with the project, on equal\nterms with all other contributors, and hope they’ll take us up on this\ninvitation.\n\nSecond, out of respect for Oracle’s trademark claim on Hudson, we will move our\ninfrastructure off of Oracle-owned and hosted servers, and we will rename\nexisting independent components of the infrastructure to no longer use \"Hudson\"\n\ni.e., mailing lists, Github repos, etc. This would be a gradual process,\nobviously.\n\nThird, we will put in place an interim governance board for the project,\nconsisting of three members - myself, Kohsuke and, if Oracle elects to remain\ninvolved, Winston Prakash, the Oracle engineer working on Hudson. The interim\nboard members will serve for the next 3-6 months, until the governance\nstructure can be nailed down securely enough to hold elections for the board\nmembers.\n\nObviously, such a move could not be undertaken without the agreement and\nsupport of the Hudson community. We believe this proposal is the best choice\nfor the project in the situation it’s currently in, but we aren’t closing off\ndiscussion, questions, etc, and we encourage your feedback and comments. If\nthere’s anything you need clarified, please ask and we’ll do our best to\nanswer.\n\nOnce Oracle’s proposal is available later this week (hopefully Wednesday,\npossibly Thursday, from what I’ve been told), which I strongly advise you all to\nread and consider, we’ll be putting up a poll to determine the position of the\ncommunity. Once that vote is done, assuming the consensus is to rename, we’ll\nput the mechanisms in motion and switch over as fast we can.\n\nThere may be some confusion as to whether we’re proposing to fork Hudson, or\nrename the existing project. I firmly believe we are proposing the latter - for\nme, the project’s key component is Kohsuke himself. If the community decides to\nsupport renaming the project to Jenkins, and Oracle chooses to continue\ndevelopment themselves under the name Hudson, they are, obviously, entirely\nwelcome to do so. But with Kohsuke working on Jenkins, that’s the true home and\nthe future of the project for me, regardless of the name.","title":"Hudson's future","tags":["general","core","meta","news","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"abayer","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Andrew was a core committer to Hudson and the author of numerous plugins.</p>\n</div>","id":"abayer","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Andrew Bayer","slug":"/blog/authors/abayer","twitter":"abayer"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"7ffb61d7-07eb-594e-9fb0-5df0fdc4f7ce","slug":"/blog/2010/12/05/weekend-update-with-andrew-bayer/","strippedHtml":"[ Ed. note Andrew was not involved in selecting this post’s title - rtyler ]\n\nI wanted to give the Hudson community a quick update on the current status of the issues Tyler has discussed in the earlier posts here.\n\nFriday afternoon, Kohsuke, CloudBees CEO Sacha Labourey and myself jumped on a conference call with Hudson contributor/Oracle employee Winston Prakash, Oracle manager Denis Tyrell and of course Ted Farrell.\n\nWe discussed a wide range of issues relating to the Hudson project, such as governance, the rights to the name Hudson, and the infrastructure hosting the Hudson project.
