Tyler Croy about Jenkins Wiki stability issues\nand making it read-only as a temporary measure to stabilize the instance\n( mailing list thread).\nAlthough the functionality has been partially restored afterwards,\nthere is a consensus in the Infrastructure team that we should gradually move to alternate solutions.\n\nExamples\n\nSince the announcement in September, more than 50 plugins were moved from Wiki to GitHub.\nFew examples:\n\nConfiguration as Code Plugin\n\nMailer Plugin\n\nGradle Plugin\n\nRole Strategy Plugin\n\nHow to enable GitHub documentation for your plugin?\n\nConvert documentation from Wiki to GitHub Asciidoc or Markdown format if you have not done it yet.\n\nIt can be easily done in a semi-automatic way using Jenkins Wiki Exporter\n\nSee the guidelines\nhere.\n\nChange the field in pom.xml so that it points to GitHub\n( guide).\n Examples of valid links:\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/mailer-plugin - plugin site will use GitHub REST API to extract README\n\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/ssh-credentials-plugin/blob/master/doc/README.md - extraction of a plugin page from a custom location\n\nOptional: Add badges to the page to improve look&feel and to provide quick links for users.\nThere are standard badges for changelogs, chats, plugin site, and installation numbers.\n\nExample for Markdown\n\nExample for Asciidoc\n\nRelease the new plugin version\n\nWait a few hours till the change propagates.\nAfter that, the Jenkins Plugin Site will show the new documentation from GitHub.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe story is tracked as jira:WEBSITE-406[] which is a part of the wider subproject for using GitHub as a source of data for the Jenkins plugin site and update managers (jira:WEBSITE-637[]).\nLater steps include support showing changelogs from GitHub releases, pulling plugin tags from GitHub, showing plugin logos, and using Repository Permission Updater as a source of the maintainer information.\n\nHow to contribute?\n\nOctober is a great time to contribute!\nPlugin documentation is one of the featured projects for Hacktoberfest,\nand we will welcome all contributions to the documentation and to the codebase.\n\nContributing to Documentation\n\nWe are looking for contributors who are interested to improve plugin documentation and to help us with migration from Wiki to GitHub.\nFor dozens of plugins the documentation is already in GitHub,\nand you are welcome to submit pull requests against any repository.\n\nMigrating documentation:\n\nMigrating plugin documentation from Wiki to GitHub\n\nMoving documentation from Jenkins Wiki to jenkins.io\n\njira:JENKINS-59467[Template issue for plugin docs migration]\n\nNewbie-friendly documentation tasks\n\nIf you have any questions about contributing to the documentation,\nplease see this page or reach out to us in the Docs SIG Gitter chat.\n\nCode contributions\n\nWould you like to write some code in Java or JavaScript?\nOr would you like to work on CSS styles and improve Jenkins design?\nIn such case you are welcome to contribute to the Jenkins Plugin Site.\nIt is our own plugin marketplace implementation, and we invite contributions to this area.\nThe plugin site is really easy to develop.\n\njira:WEBSITE-637[] -
