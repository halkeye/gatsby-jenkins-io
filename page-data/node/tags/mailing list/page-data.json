More than half of the total votes were from ineligible voters, but the result would have been the same either way. The final result of all eligible votes is as follows: 214 votes to rename, and 14 for the status quo. You can see the individual votes hudson-jenkins-vote.\nSo what does this mean now? Well, it means Jenkins lives. We’ve registered jenkins-ci.org, though it’s empty at the moment. In the coming days, we will be renaming the existing Google Groups to jenkins-*@googlegroups.com, renaming the Twitter account from @hudsonci to @jenkinsci, and renaming our organization at Github from hudson to jenkinsci. I wanted to make sure everyone had notice ahead of time that this was happening, so that no one gets surprised by changes to their incoming mail, etc. As said before, the initial, interim governance board will consist of me, Kohsuke and, if he and Oracle are willing, Winston. If Winston is unwilling or unable to continue in that role with Jenkins, we will select a replacement interim member. The interim board will work on the details of a more permanent governance process going forward. Discussions on the infrastructure changes (including things like the Maven groupId/artifactIds, etc) will be in public, on these lists. We’re working to get the JIRA and wiki contents migrated over to the Jenkins site, and hope to work with Oracle to get that done in the next couple days.\n\nPutting aside logistics, I want to personally thank everyone for voting, and especially thank everyone who voted for renaming for supporting the Jenkins project and its future. Jenkins is not Oracle’s project, nor CloudBee’s project, nor my project, nor Kohsuke’s project - it’s the community’s project, and it’s going to thrive.","title":"Jenkins!","tags":["general","core","mailing list","meta","news","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"abayer","html":"","id":"abayer","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Andrew Bayer","slug":"/blog/authors/abayer","twitter":"abayer"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2010-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3f0eefca-2731-5b8f-bd42-5ab978ea40ec","slug":"/blog/2010/11/23/new-hudson-mailing-lists/","strippedHtml":"As Kohsuke mentioned in this post, the Java.net migration has caught just about everybody off-guard in the Hudson community.\n\nThe tools we use hosted by Java.net are essentially locked from us until further notice (no ETA on the migration) which is, as you might imagine frustrating both for the core developers but hundreds of plugin developers that make Hudson the best damned CI server on the planet.\n\nFor source code we’re working on getting something in place for contributions on GitHub thanks to some assistance from the GitHub team.\n\nFor mailing lists we’ve gone ahead and dumped Java.net mailing lists in favor of a collection of Google Groups:\n\nhudson-dev\n\nhudson-users\n\nhudson-commits\n\nhudson-issues\n\nContrary to popular belief, you do not need a Google account to subscribe to these lists, else we wouldn’t have chosen Google Groups. All you need to do is send an email to \" hudson-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com\" and you’ll receive a confirmation email from the mailing list server shortly.\n\nSince our issues.hudson-ci.org isn’t actually hosted on Java.net, but rather on a machine provided by Oracle, they should continue to function as per usual. The login for the systems is somewhat tied to Java.net so I am honestly not sure how stable they will be this week.\n\nI apologize sincerely for the confusion and frustration, you can trust that we’re likely ten-times more frustrated with this situation right now.\n---","title":"New Hudson Mailing Lists!","tags":["general","mailing list","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
