It was an experiment to let\nplugins be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main\nJava Virtual Machine runtime with help of JRuby.\nA similar extension was made to allow plugins to be written in Python but still integrated into the Java Virtual Machine with Jython.\n\nOver the years though, the experiments are no longer being maintained and the\nplugins that use the non-Java runtimes take a lot of compatibility effort.\nIn addition, the Jenkins ruby runtime does not support Java 11.\nSpecifically, the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins\ncore developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and\nprocesses to keep the non-Java runtimes barely working.\nExamples of the experienced issues include compatibility with jep:200[Switch Remoting/XStream blocklist to a permitlist] where we had to allow many Ruby Runtime classes in the Jenkins core to support serialization of data.\n\nIn 2018 we discussed the future of the Ruby Runtime based plugins.\nThere was a consensus that we want to deprecate and remove the plugins so that Jenkins users do not experience issues .\nDaniel Beck created jep:7[Deprecation of ruby-runtime] for that.\nOver the years, the functionality provided by Ruby plugins has been largely replaced by other implementations,\nand hence we have decided to proceed with the deprecation\n( discussion).\n\nOne month from now, January 22nd, 2022, the default Jenkins update center will stop distributing\nthe Ruby runtime plugin, the plugins that use the Ruby runtime, the Python runtime plugin, and the plugin that uses the Python runtime.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nIf you are one of the few users who are using the following plugins, there will be no impact on your existing instances. The\nonly change will come for new installs. Suspended plugins will stay\ninstalled, but can not be newly installed without manually downloading\nreleases or using custom update centers.\n\nJenkins plugin management tools and distributions may be affected as well if they use the default update center to download the plugins and/or their metadata.\nIt includes but is not limited to the official Docker images,\nHelm charts,\nJenkinsfile Runner,\nCustom Jenkins WAR Packager,\nand the Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool.\nNote that all these tools allow custom update sites to be configured if required.\n\nThe lists below provide additional information about the plugins based on the Ruby Runtime and the Python Runtime.\nPlease plan your transition away from these plugins.\nThey will be removed from the official Jenkins update centers on January 22, 2022.\n\nAffected plugins\n\nGitlab Hook\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nContains multiple security vulnerabilties.\nSuggestion: Use the GitLab plugin and the GitLab Branch Source plugin.\n\nCucumber\n\nLast released 9 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run cucumber from the command line.\n\npyenv\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run

ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run rbenv from the command line.\n\nChef\n\nLast released 6 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh or bat to run chef from the command line.\n\nCI Skip\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the GitHub Commit Skip SCM Behaviour, Bitbucket Commit Skip SCM Behaviour, or SCM Skip to skip builds based on the content of commit messages.\nAlternately, use sh, bat, or other scripts to read git commit messages and conditionally execute Pipeline steps.\n\nInstallShield\n\nLast released 8 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh, bat, or other scripts to run InstallShield.\n\nMySQL Job Databases\n\nLast released 7 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use Jenkins Job Database Manager Plugin for MySQL.\n\nPathignore\n\nLast released 10 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use the path ignore features of various plugins or use sh, bat, or other scripts to read git commit messages and conditionally execute Pipeline steps.\n\nPerl\n\nLast released 9 years ago.\nSuggestion: Use sh

Ruby Runtime based plugins and the Python Runtime based plugin.\nWe also thank those who participated in development of new plugins replacing the functionality.\nThese contributors helped millions of Jenkins users while the ecosystem was supported over the past 10 years\nand it is not taken for granted.\nNow we need to move on so that we can keep expanding the Jenkins architecture and developers tools.\nWe invite all contributors to participate in this effort and to help us to migrate the plugins to supported JVM-based platforms for plugins.\n\nMy instance is affected, what to do next?\n\nIf you do not use the affected plugins, the recommendation is to remove them.\nOtherwise, it is recommended to start migration out of the plugins to alternatives providing similar functionality.\n\nNot all plugins have alternatives.\nAt the moment the Jenkins core team does not plan to provide a replacement, but any contributions are welcome.\nIf you depend on the functionality,\nwe recommend reaching out to the community in the developer mailing list so that\nyou can coordinate the replacement with other affected users.","title":"Deprecating non-Java

bundles Guava, a core Java library from Google.\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.320 (released on November 10, 2021), Jenkins has upgraded the Guava library from\n11.0.1 (released on January 9, 2012) to\n31.0.1 (released on September 27, 2021).\nPlugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nUse the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\n\nMotivation\n\nMany security-conscious organizations using, or planning to use, Jenkins run off-the-shelf security scanners to look for known vulnerabilities.\nThese commonly flag the obsolete Guava library as susceptible to a serialization-related vulnerability ( CVE-2018-10237) and recommend upgrading.\nWhile Jenkins uses JEP-200 to form an explicit list of allowed classes for deserialization,\nand the two Guava classes affected by CVE-2018-10237 are not and will never be added to the list,\nit is time-consuming for the security team to respond to purported security reports\nand for users to justify exemptions from policy to use Jenkins anyway.\n\nFurthermore, the decade-old version of Guava has long been a maintenance burden for Jenkins developers.\nIn a world where Dependabot offers upgrades to libraries released just hours before,\nit is unpleasant to be working with dependencies that are many years old.\n\nFor more information, see JEP-233.\n\nUpgrading\n\nThe vast majority of plugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nJenkins users need only upgrade plugins to compatible versions as documented in the \"Released As\" field in Jira.\nIt is critical to use the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\nFailure to upgrade plugins to compatible versions may result in ClassNotFoundException, NoClassDefFoundError, or other low-level Java errors.\n\nReporting issues\n\nIf you find a regression in a plugin, please file a bug report in Jira:\n\nOpen JEP-233 issues\n\nWhen reporting an issue, include the following information:\n\nUse the JEP-233 label.\n\nProvide the complete list of installed plugins as suggested in the bug reporting guidelines.\n\nProvide the complete stack trace, if relevant.\n\nProvide steps to reproduce the issue from scratch on a minimal Jenkins installation; the scenario should fail when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.320 or later and pass when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.319 or earlier.\n\nIf you maintain a Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nthen please check if there is a pull request awaiting merge or release.\nIf you use an unmaintained Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nconsider stepping up and adopting the plugin to release a compatible version.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe expect to see a bit of disruption from these changes\nbut hope that in the long run they will save time for core and plugin developers\nand lead to a more secure and stable tool.\nPlease reach out on the developers' list with any questions or suggestions.","title":"Guava library upgrade (breaking

you’ve been following JenkinsIsTheWay.io, you’ve read some fantastic stories from the Jenkins user community about the great stuff they are building with Jenkins.\nWith over 200,000 installations to date, Jenkins remains the most widely used open-source automation server.\nAnd story after story, we hear what a critical role Jenkins plays in building robust, secure CI/CD pipelines.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that in many of the back (and remote) offices of Fortune 500 companies, developers are turning to Jenkins to help make their lives easier with automation while also giving their engineers more time to innovate.\nWith this in mind, I invite you to read the latest ebook focused on the behind-the-scenes development activities underway in large-scale enterprises.\n\nJenkins led\n\nLearn how companies like IBM continue to innovate their software prowess while confidently relying on their custom-built CI/CD pipelines.\nYou’ll also read how Jenkins became the ultimate collaboration tool for thousands of Apple developers.\nAnd we don’t just shine the spotlight on tech companies.\nIn this ebook, Jenkins users span multiple industries across the enterprise.\n\nYou’ll read how Jenkins made it possible to standardize multidisciplinary team procedures so Roche engineers can create innovative healthcare applications with confidence.\nWe also dive into how Telstra’s software team was able to automate the build cycle - across 100,000 microservices - to accelerate the creation of world-class communication tools.\nAnd how Sainsbury’s development team used Jenkins as the way to \"bring a retail giant into the 21st century\".\n\nResults inspired\n\nNo time to dive into this Fortune 500 ebook?\nI thought it’s worth highlighting the real-world results experienced by enterprise developers and engineers who have turned to awesome plugins to help build, deploy and automate their software solutions.\nHere’s what they had to say in their own words!\n\nSoftware acceleration\n\nBuild times are much faster with the new node mechanism\n\nShared build pipelines are consistent and evolve faster\n\nFaster deployment times - from 5 days to several minutes\n\nDeploy multiple server patches 30x faster than normal processes\n\nReduce release time from 7 to 4 days\n\nSimpler, smarter processes\n\nOne-stop-shop for building, deploying, monitoring, testing and even self-managing\n\nEasy onboarding for new applications\n\nCredential management has gotten much simpler and stricter\n\nMade setting up CI/CD really easy\n\nProvides the visibility needed to track the deployment process\n\nLoved and relied on by developers\n\nUltimate collaboration tool for thousands of developers\n\n100% confidence in a consistent and repeatable pipeline\n\nKeeps the DevOps team in the loop\n\nJenkins-as-code has freed teams up to experiment more\n\nTeams are more self-empowered to provision and support their own builds\n\nOne thing to remember is that since Jenkins is a free open source solution, it also means savings across the enterprise.\nThis is highlighted in several of our user stories in this ebook.\nYou’ll discover how peers have \"decreased build server costs\" and have mentioned \"cost-cutting\" as a top Jenkins benefit.\n\nShare your story\n\nWhether working for a large corporation or an emerging tech startup, we relish hearing your experiences and the results you get with a Jenkins assist.\nWhen you’re ready to tell your story, we’re prepared to help you share it.\nFill out our short questionnaire, and we’ll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt

are happy to announce that\nthe Jenkins community has moved all its official IRC channels to Libera chat.\nWe have started our migration on May 26 as a response to the\nhostile takeover\nof hundreds of open source community channel by the new Freenode management.\nAs decided  by the Jenkins governance meeting on June 16th,\nLibera Chat IRC channels are the only official channels going forward.\n\nA more detailed history of the transition is available on the Jenkins developers mailing list.\n\nWhat did we move?\n\nWe have created the following IRC chats:\n\nthat currently live on freenode to libera.chat:\n\n#jenkins - general discussion channel for Jenkins users and developers.\nWe no longer consider it a central chat for all things Jenkins, but we intend to keep it available to users\nwho want to keep using IRC.\n\n#jenkins-hosting - Chat used by the Hosting Team to manage hosting automation\n\n#jenkins-infra - Chat used by the Infrastructure Team to coordinate efforts related to Jenkins project infrastructure and the incident response\n\n#jenkins-release - Chat used for Jenkins core release coordination by the Release Team\n\nAll other channels have NOT been moved to Libera Chat IRC and were replaced by other channels.\nMost notable channels:\n\n#jenkins-meeting - the Jenkins Governance Meeting uses combination of Zoom and Google Docs at the moment. We do not longer use the IRC chat for that purpose.\n\n#jenkins-cert - no private chat going forward. The Security Team will use mailing lists only going forward\n\n#jenkins-community - Replaced by the Advocacy&Outreach Gitter channel.\n\nFreenode concerns and disclaimers\n\nGoing forward, the Jenkins community does not have ANY official channels on Freenode.\nAll channels are either removed or left abandoned.\nWe no longer manage or control our channels.\nMost of the Jenkins IRC channel operators use IRCCloud,\nand hence they were banned by the Freenode team on June 11th.\nOnly a few operators have reconnected since this event.\n\nTaking the takeover of Freenode and hostile actions taken by the new management,\nwe can no longer guarantee any of the following:\n\nAuthenticity of registered users on Freenode.\nAll IRC accounts, cloaked or not, might have been taken over by the new Freenode management.\n Do not trust messages from the Jenkins contributor account IDs there.\n\nConfidentiality of private channels like #jenkins-cert.\nWe performed audit of the conversations there, and we believe there are no undisclosed security vulnerabilities referenced in the channel.\n After all, this IRC has been rather dormant for the last 18 months.\n\nIRC User Passwords.\nAll passwords on Freenode IRC may be compromised in the future.\nWe strongly advise all users to rotate their passwords if they were used on Freenode IRC.\n\nWe have made backups of IRC channel conversations in the abandoned channels.\nIf you need to access the conversation history, please reach out to the Jenkins Infrastructure team.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the entire Libera Chat team and all contributors who have worked on creating\na Freenode replacement for hundreds of open source communities using IRC.\nWithin just a month, a new platform has been created and adopted by almost all active projects.\nWe remember the Hudson to Jenkins renaming days when a similar mobilization happened in the Jenkins community,\nand we appreciate all the effort put by contributors.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels\nand our automation like the IRC Bot used by the Jenkins hosting team.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn the Jenkins community we will keep using Libera Chat IRC and maintaining user and contributor channels there.\nOther Jenkins chat channels like Gitter and Slack are unchanged.\nWe intend to gradually replace many of those channels with community.jenkins.io.\nThis is a new portal powered by Discourse.\nThe service is sponsored by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc..\nIt is

little over a year ago, we launched JenkinsIsTheWay.io, a website whose sole purpose is to share Jenkins user stories with the developers and engineers in our community.  Over a hundred of you have already shared your innovations, and they just keep coming.  It comes as no surprise that many of the submitted stories are from IT consultants and software developers around the world building next-generation DevOps and CI/CD platforms to fuel the modernization of enterprise companies far and wide.\n\nThat’s why we’ve dedicated our latest eBook to focus on Jenkins users in the global Information Technology sector.  We shine the spotlight on these developers and engineers who have solved unique software development and DevOps challenges by turning to the leading open source automation server.  From powering large enterprises needing a better way to manage their inventory to innovative tech firms looking to advance technologies and healthcare initiatives during a pandemic, you’ll read about how teams everywhere solved their unique challenges — with the help of Jenkins.\n\nJenkins is the Way to…\n\nIn our short User Story Survey, we ask Jenkins users to fill in the blank: Jenkins is the way to …​…​\n\nWe’ve seen results-oriented submissions like \"Jenkins is the way to deliver our new releases on time!\" and \"Jenkins is the way to understand and simplify your software workflows.\"  Several submissions riffed off of something like \"Jenkins is the way to completely automate your CI/CD workflow.\"  Meanwhile, others have had a bit more fun and languished praise on Jenkins, stating, \"Jenkins is the way to help teams focus on what is really important, make our life easier\" and, even, \"Jenkins is the way to save the day.\"\n\nIn this new eBook, we focus on the challenges users in the community face, and what they’ve built using Jenkins to achieve their unique goals. For example, Build & Release Manager, Donald Morton, turned to Jenkins to establish a flexible, modern, and more efficient DevOps platform for Graylog, a leading log management platform serving the enterprise.\n\nWith a Jenkins assist, Mark Baumann, DevOps Engineer with ITK Engineering, created “ one CI to rule them all.” He told us that “Jenkins provides a common CI/CD platform for all different kinds of projects and technology domains.”\n\nWhen IBM Lead Software Engineer Alec Rieger sought to simplify the build and testing pipeline for the company’s software engineers and developers, he also turned to Jenkins.  For a company the size of IBM, which services enterprise clients worldwide, Rieger wanted to help his colleagues manage many nodes on a large scale. Now, according to his Jenkins Is The Way user story, IBM uses Jenkins pipelines for each of their builds and relies on the flexibility and countless plugin features to continually improve their processes.\n\nStronger, Smarter, Faster Software Innovation\n\nWhile we all fondly think of Jenkins as a modest butler who has empowered developers with the open-source tools they need to succeed — on JenkinsIsTheWay.io, we liken him to an unpretentious, yet powerful superhero.  And like any great superhero, he (or she!) is sure to save the day.\n\nFor our Jenkins users, that means results — significant, measurable results with a common theme.  Using Jenkins has enabled you — the user — to help the businesses you serve save money, spin up software faster, and automate processes.  In doing so, you’ve freed up developers and engineers from countless hours of mundane tasks.  Thanks to Jenkins, you’re empowering entire IT teams to innovate, focus on what they love to do and, ultimately, build great stuff.\n\nOf course, we devote much of our latest eBook to those victories.  Results like how RedHat’s releases are 5x faster thanks to Jenkins.  The fact that DevOps problem tickets were reduced by over 90% for Electronic Health Solutions.  And why the CTO at Cloudologia was psyched to share that — with a Jenkins at the helm — they were able to shorten onboarding for deployment & build release cycles from one week to a single day.\n\nShare Your User Story, Too!\n\nI am proud to share another common theme from the users who have submitted their story:  you turn to our community for collaboration, guidance, and advice.  A community of a million strong and growing, this eBook and JenkinsIsTheWay.io are other ways to provide you with the insight and lessons learned by developers and engineers, like you, to innovate and build next-generation technologies for companies of all sizes.\n\nWhen you’re ready to tell your story, we’re prepared to help you share it. Fill out our short questionnaire, and we’ll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt as a thank you once it’s published!\n\nLinks\n\nJenkins IsThe Way.
