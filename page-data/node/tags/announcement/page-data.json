Guava, a core Java library from Google.\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.320 (released on November 10, 2021), Jenkins has upgraded the Guava library from\n11.0.1 (released on January 9, 2012) to\n31.0.1 (released on September 27, 2021).\nPlugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nUse the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\n\nMotivation\n\nMany security-conscious organizations using, or planning to use, Jenkins run off-the-shelf security scanners to look for known vulnerabilities.\nThese commonly flag the obsolete Guava library as susceptible to a serialization-related vulnerability ( CVE-2018-10237) and recommend upgrading.\nWhile Jenkins uses JEP-200 to form an explicit list of allowed classes for deserialization,\nand the two Guava classes affected by CVE-2018-10237 are not and will never be added to the list,\nit is time-consuming for the security team to respond to purported security reports\nand for users to justify exemptions from policy to use Jenkins anyway.\n\nFurthermore, the decade-old version of Guava has long been a maintenance burden for Jenkins developers.\nIn a world where Dependabot offers upgrades to libraries released just hours before,\nit is unpleasant to be working with dependencies that are many years old.\n\nFor more information, see JEP-233.\n\nUpgrading\n\nThe vast majority of plugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in JEP-233.\nJenkins users need only upgrade plugins to compatible versions as documented in the \"Released As\" field in Jira.\nIt is critical to use the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.\nFailure to upgrade plugins to compatible versions may result in ClassNotFoundException, NoClassDefFoundError, or other low-level Java errors.\n\nReporting issues\n\nIf you find a regression in a plugin, please file a bug report in Jira:\n\nOpen JEP-233 issues\n\nWhen reporting an issue, include the following information:\n\nUse the JEP-233 label.\n\nProvide the complete list of installed plugins as suggested in the bug reporting guidelines.\n\nProvide the complete stack trace, if relevant.\n\nProvide steps to reproduce the issue from scratch on a minimal Jenkins installation; the scenario should fail when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.320 or later and pass when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.319 or earlier.\n\nIf you maintain a Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nthen please check if there is a pull request awaiting merge or release.\nIf you use an unmaintained Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,\nconsider stepping up and adopting the plugin to release a compatible version.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe expect to see a bit of disruption from these changes\nbut hope that in the long run they will save time for core and plugin developers\nand lead to a more secure and stable tool.\nPlease reach out on the developers' list with any questions or suggestions.","title":"Guava library upgrade (breaking

are happy to announce that\nthe Jenkins community has moved all its official IRC channels to Libera chat.\nWe have started our migration on May 26 as a response to the\nhostile takeover\nof hundreds of open source community channel by the new Freenode management.\nAs decided  by the Jenkins governance meeting on June 16th,\nLibera Chat IRC channels are the only official channels going forward.\n\nA more detailed history of the transition is available on the Jenkins developers mailing list.\n\nWhat did we move?\n\nWe have created the following IRC chats:\n\nthat currently live on freenode to libera.chat:\n\n#jenkins - general discussion channel for Jenkins users and developers.\nWe no longer consider it a central chat for all things Jenkins, but we intend to keep it available to users\nwho want to keep using IRC.\n\n#jenkins-hosting - Chat used by the Hosting Team to manage hosting automation\n\n#jenkins-infra - Chat used by the Infrastructure Team to coordinate efforts related to Jenkins project infrastructure and the incident response\n\n#jenkins-release - Chat used for Jenkins core release coordination by the Release Team\n\nAll other channels have NOT been moved to Libera Chat IRC and were replaced by other channels.\nMost notable channels:\n\n#jenkins-meeting - the Jenkins Governance Meeting uses combination of Zoom and Google Docs at the moment. We do not longer use the IRC chat for that purpose.\n\n#jenkins-cert - no private chat going forward. The Security Team will use mailing lists only going forward\n\n#jenkins-community - Replaced by the Advocacy&Outreach Gitter channel.\n\nFreenode concerns and disclaimers\n\nGoing forward, the Jenkins community does not have ANY official channels on Freenode.\nAll channels are either removed or left abandoned.\nWe no longer manage or control our channels.\nMost of the Jenkins IRC channel operators use IRCCloud,\nand hence they were banned by the Freenode team on June 11th.\nOnly a few operators have reconnected since this event.\n\nTaking the takeover of Freenode and hostile actions taken by the new management,\nwe can no longer guarantee any of the following:\n\nAuthenticity of registered users on Freenode.\nAll IRC accounts, cloaked or not, might have been taken over by the new Freenode management.\n Do not trust messages from the Jenkins contributor account IDs there.\n\nConfidentiality of private channels like #jenkins-cert.\nWe performed audit of the conversations there, and we believe there are no undisclosed security vulnerabilities referenced in the channel.\n After all, this IRC has been rather dormant for the last 18 months.\n\nIRC User Passwords.\nAll passwords on Freenode IRC may be compromised in the future.\nWe strongly advise all users to rotate their passwords if they were used on Freenode IRC.\n\nWe have made backups of IRC channel conversations in the abandoned channels.\nIf you need to access the conversation history, please reach out to the Jenkins Infrastructure team.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the entire Libera Chat team and all contributors who have worked on creating\na Freenode replacement for hundreds of open source communities using IRC.\nWithin just a month, a new platform has been created and adopted by almost all active projects.\nWe remember the Hudson to Jenkins renaming days when a similar mobilization happened in the Jenkins community,\nand we appreciate all the effort put by contributors.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels\nand our automation like the IRC Bot used by the Jenkins hosting team.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn the Jenkins community we will keep using Libera Chat IRC and maintaining user and contributor channels there.\nOther Jenkins chat channels like Gitter and Slack are unchanged.\nWe intend to gradually replace many of those channels with community.jenkins.io.\nThis is a new portal powered by Discourse.\nThe service is sponsored by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc..\nIt is currently in preview, stay tuned for announcements.\nAs always, we will appreciate any suggestions and feedback!","title":"Jenkins IRC moves to Libera

little over a year ago, we launched JenkinsIsTheWay.io, a website whose sole purpose is to share Jenkins user stories with the developers and engineers in our community.  Over a hundred of you have already shared your innovations, and they just keep coming.  It comes as no surprise that many of the submitted stories are from IT consultants and software developers around the world building next-generation DevOps and CI/CD platforms to fuel the modernization of enterprise companies far and wide.\n\nThat’s why we’ve dedicated our latest eBook to focus on Jenkins users in the global Information Technology sector.  We shine the spotlight on these developers and engineers who have solved unique software development and DevOps challenges by turning to the leading open source automation server.  From powering large enterprises needing a better way to manage their inventory to innovative tech firms looking to advance technologies and healthcare initiatives during a pandemic, you’ll read about how teams everywhere solved their unique challenges — with the help of Jenkins.\n\nJenkins is the Way to…\n\nIn our short User Story Survey, we ask Jenkins users to fill in the blank: Jenkins is the way to …​…​\n\nWe’ve seen results-oriented submissions like \"Jenkins is the way to deliver our new releases on time!\" and \"Jenkins is the way to understand and simplify your software workflows.\"  Several submissions riffed off of something like \"Jenkins is the way to completely automate your CI/CD workflow.\"  Meanwhile, others have had a bit more fun and languished praise on Jenkins, stating, \"Jenkins is the way to help teams focus on what is really important, make our life easier\" and, even, \"Jenkins is the way to save the day.\"\n\nIn this new eBook, we focus on the challenges users in the community face, and what they’ve built using Jenkins to achieve their unique goals. For example, Build & Release Manager, Donald Morton, turned to Jenkins to establish a flexible, modern, and more efficient DevOps platform for Graylog, a leading log management platform serving the enterprise.\n\nWith a Jenkins assist, Mark Baumann, DevOps Engineer with ITK Engineering, created “ one CI to rule them all.” He told us that “Jenkins provides a common CI/CD platform for all different kinds of projects and technology domains.”\n\nWhen IBM Lead Software Engineer Alec Rieger sought to simplify the build and testing pipeline for the company’s software engineers and developers, he also turned to Jenkins.  For a company the size of IBM, which services enterprise clients worldwide, Rieger wanted to help his colleagues manage many nodes on a large scale. Now, according to his Jenkins Is The Way user story, IBM uses Jenkins pipelines for each of their builds and relies on the flexibility and countless plugin features to continually improve their processes.\n\nStronger, Smarter, Faster Software Innovation\n\nWhile we all fondly think of Jenkins as a modest butler who has empowered developers with the open-source tools they need to succeed — on JenkinsIsTheWay.io, we liken him to an unpretentious, yet powerful superhero.  And like any great superhero, he (or she!) is sure to save the day.\n\nFor our Jenkins users, that means results — significant, measurable results with a common theme.  Using Jenkins has enabled you — the user — to help the businesses you serve save money, spin up software faster, and automate processes.  In doing so, you’ve freed up developers and engineers from countless hours of mundane tasks.  Thanks to Jenkins, you’re empowering entire IT teams to innovate, focus on what they love to do and, ultimately, build great stuff.\n\nOf course, we devote much of our latest eBook to those victories.  Results like how RedHat’s releases are 5x faster thanks to Jenkins.  The fact that DevOps problem tickets were reduced by over 90% for Electronic Health Solutions.  And why the CTO at Cloudologia was psyched to share that — with a Jenkins at the helm — they were able to shorten onboarding for deployment & build release cycles from one week to a single day.\n\nShare Your User Story, Too!\n\nI am proud to share another common theme from the users who have submitted their story:  you turn to our community for collaboration, guidance, and advice.  A community of a million strong and growing, this eBook and JenkinsIsTheWay.io are other ways to provide you with the insight and lessons learned by developers and engineers, like you, to innovate and build next-generation technologies for companies of all sizes.\n\nWhen you’re ready to tell your story, we’re prepared to help you share it.

the 29th of March 2021, we’ll rotate the Jenkins update center certificate.\nThe existing certificate expires in April 2021.\nWhen the new certificate is installed on March 29, 2021, Jenkins versions older than 2.178 (April 2018), won’t be able to communicate with the default and experimental update centers.\nInstances using alternative update centers (self-hosted or vendor-provided) will not be affected by this change.\nRegarding plugins update, the update-center usually supports up to one-year-old Jenkins core versions with 2.204 being the oldest version supported.\n\nIf you don’t update regularly, please review the Jenkins security advisories and use this change as your motivation to update to a more recent Jenkins version.\n\nWho\n\nJenkins users running Jenkins versions older than 2.178 will not see any further updates after the update center certificate change March 29, 2021.\n\nJenkins developers will not see plugin updates when they use mvn hpi:run to test their plugin if the Jenkins version is older than 2.178.\nPlugin developers can update their minimum Jenkins version to a newer Jenkins version.\nRefer to the guidelines in\"Choosing a Jenkins version\" when selecting the new minimum Jenkins version.\nPlugin developers may also be able to test with a newer Jenkins version using arguments like mvn -Djenkins.version=2.249.1 hpi:run.\n\nJenkins users running versions 2.178 or newer are not affected by this change.\n\nWhat\n\nJenkins uses the update center to identify updates to core and to plugins.\nThe service signs its metadata with a certificate that is cross-signed by a root certificate.\nJenkins is bundled with the root certificate so it can confirm the authenticity of update center data.\nWhen updates are available, an alert is shown to Jenkins users that reminds them to update.\n\nWhy\n\nThe root certificate bundled in Jenkins was created in April 2011 and will expire in April 2021.\nWe prepared for this rotation in April 2018 when we bundled the new root certificate with Jenkins core releases.\nIt’s now time to use the new root certificate with a new update center certificate.\nThe new root certificate will expire in April 2028.\n\nYou can follow the work for this certificate rotation in this ticket INFRA-2902\n\nSo again, keep your instance updated and everything should be fine.\n\nSee you in 2028,\n\nVarious

with Jenkins 2.279 and Jenkins 2.263.4, the Jenkins project is upgrading the base operating system and Java version used in the jenkins/jenkins:latest and jenkins/jenkins:lts images.\nThe update replaces OpenJDK 8u242 with AdoptOpenJDK 8u282 and replaces Debian 9 (\"Stretch\") with Debian 10 (\"Buster\").\n\nWhy?\n\nWe’re changing the base image so that we have a better supported operating system and a more current Java release for Jenkins controllers.\n\nBetter supported operating system\n\nThe Docker images provided by the Jenkins project rely on the operating system security processes of the operating system provider.\n\nOur Docker images have used Debian 9 (\"Stretch\") for multiple years.\nDebian 9 security updates have been discontinued as of July 6, 2020.\nDebian 9 Long Term Support security updates will be discontinued at the end of June 2022.\nThe upgrade to Debian 10 keeps us on an operating system maintained by the operating system security team.\n\nMore current Java release\n\nThe Debian 9 Docker images were based on the openjdk:8-jdk-stretch Docker image.\nThe last update to that image was one year ago with the release of JDK 8u242.\nWe need a maintained Docker base image that keeps pace with JDK releases and operating system updates so that the controller is running the most recent Java updates and most recent operating system updates.\n\nOther Jenkins controller images have already switched from using openjdk base images to instead use base images provided by Eclipse Adoptium.\nEclipse Adoptium is the Eclipse project formed when AdoptOpenJDK joined the Eclipse Foundation.\nThis change adapts the jenkins/jenkins:latest and jenkins/jenkins:lts images to use the Adoptium JDK images in the same pattern as is already used for the Jenkins JDK 11 Docker images like jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11.\nThe Jenkins Platform SIG has enjoyed very good results in our interactions with the Eclipse Adoptium project.\nWe look forward to continuing our collaboration with them.\n\nThanks a lot to Alex Earl and Jim Crowley for the image build restructuring groundwork that made the image upgrade possible!\nAlso thanks to Oleg Nenashev and other contributors for their reviews and testing.\n\nPackaging changes\n\nThe Jenkins Docker image based on Debian 10 (\"Buster\") includes some different packages than Debian 9 (\"Stretch\").\nSome packages have been removed because they are no longer supported by their communities.\nSome packages have been removed due to infrequent and decreasing use.\nUsers of the Jenkins Docker images may need to extend their definition of their Docker image to include packages that are no longer included in the base image.\n\nSCM packages removed\n\nThe following source control management packages are no longer included in the Jenkins controller images for jenkins/jenkins:latest or for jenkins/jenkins:lts :\n\nbzr\n\nmercurial\n\nsubversion\n\nOther packages removed\n\nAdditional packages that are no longer included in the Jenkins controller images include:\n\nbzip2\n\nmime-support\n\npython (the Python project stopped supporting Python 2 January 1, 2020)\n\nxz-utils\n\nA detailed list of the exact package changes is available in the pull request.\n\nUpgrade and compatibility notes\n\nThe Jenkins controller images are designed to be extended to meet user needs.\nCustom Jenkins controller images can be created from the base images and are designed to allow additional Jenkins plugins and additional operating system packages.\n\nFor example, the Installing Docker instructions illustrate a technique to install the Blue Ocean plugins and some operating system packages in a custom Docker image.\n\nDocker image with Subversion\n\nThe following Docker image definition installs the most recent Jenkins Long Term Support release with the subversion plugin and the operating system subversion command:\n\nFROM jenkins/jenkins:lts\nUSER root\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends subversion\nUSER jenkins\nRUN jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins subversion:2.14.0\n\nBuild a new docker image from this Dockerfile and assign the image a meaningful name, e.g. \"myjenkins-subversion:1.1\":\n\ndocker build -t myjenkins-subversion:1.1 .\n\nDocker image with Mercurial\n\nThe following Docker image definition installs the most recent Jenkins Weekly release with the mercurial plugin and the operating system hg command:\n\nFROM jenkins/jenkins:latest\nUSER root\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends mercurial\nUSER jenkins\nRUN jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins mercurial:2.12\n\nBuild a new docker image from this Dockerfile and assign the image a meaningful name, e.g. \"myjenkins-mercurial:1.1\":\n\ndocker build -t myjenkins-mercurial:1.1 .\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe will continue Docker image updates as new Java versions are released.\n\nIf you are interested in new features in Jenkins Docker packaging,\nstay tuned for future announcements!\nThere are multiple ongoing initiatives which you can find on the public Jenkins roadmap.\nSome stories:\n\nSwitching to AdoptOpenJDK.\n\nGeneral availability of Windows images.\n\nSupport for more platforms (AArch64, IBM s390x, PowerPC).\n\nIntroducing multi-platform Docker images.\n\nIf you are interested in any of these projects and would like to contribute,\nplease reach out to the Platform Special Interest Group which coordinates initiatives related to Jenkins in
