The Security Team will use mailing lists only going forward\n\n#jenkins-community - Replaced by the Advocacy&Outreach Gitter channel.\n\nFreenode concerns and disclaimers\n\nGoing forward, the Jenkins community does not have ANY official channels on Freenode.\nAll channels are either removed or left abandoned.\nWe no longer manage or control our channels.\nMost of the Jenkins IRC channel operators use IRCCloud,\nand hence they were banned by the Freenode team on June 11th.\nOnly a few operators have reconnected since this event.\n\nTaking the takeover of Freenode and hostile actions taken by the new management,\nwe can no longer guarantee any of the following:\n\nAuthenticity of registered users on Freenode.\nAll IRC accounts, cloaked or not, might have been taken over by the new Freenode management.\n Do not trust messages from the Jenkins contributor account IDs there.\n\nConfidentiality of private channels like #jenkins-cert.\nWe performed audit of the conversations there, and we believe there are no undisclosed security vulnerabilities referenced in the channel.\n After all, this IRC has been rather dormant for the last 18 months.\n\nIRC User Passwords.\nAll passwords on Freenode IRC may be compromised in the future.\nWe strongly advise all users to rotate their passwords if they were used on Freenode IRC.\n\nWe have made backups of IRC channel conversations in the abandoned channels.\nIf you need to access the conversation history, please reach out to the Jenkins Infrastructure team.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the entire Libera Chat team and all contributors who have worked on creating\na Freenode replacement for hundreds of open source communities using IRC.\nWithin just a month, a new platform has been created and adopted by almost all active projects.\nWe remember the Hudson to Jenkins renaming days when a similar mobilization happened in the Jenkins community,\nand we appreciate all the effort put by contributors.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels\nand our automation like the IRC Bot used by the Jenkins hosting team.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIn the Jenkins community we will keep using Libera Chat IRC and maintaining user and contributor channels there.\nOther Jenkins chat channels like Gitter and Slack are unchanged.\nWe intend to gradually replace many of those channels with community.jenkins.io.\nThis is a new portal powered by Discourse.\nThe service is sponsored by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc..\nIt is currently in preview, stay tuned for announcements.\nAs always, we will appreciate any suggestions and [feedback]( https://community.jenkins.io/c/site-feedback/2)!","title":"Jenkins IRC moves to Libera Chat","tags":["community","announcement","chat"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"markewaite","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Mark is the <a href=\"/project/team-leads/#documentation\">Jenkins Documentation Officer</a>, a long-time Jenkins user and contributor, and maintains the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/git\">git plugin</a> and the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client\">git client plugin</a>.\nHe is active in <a href=\"/sigs/\">Jenkins special interest groups</a> including the <a href=\"/sigs/docs/\">Docs SIG</a>, <a href=\"/sigs/platform\">Platform SIG</a>, and <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach\">Advocacy SIG</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"markewaite","irc":"markewaite","linkedin":"markwaite","name":"Mark Waite","slug":"/blog/author/markewaite","twitter":"MarkEWaite"},{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"/blog/author/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2021-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","id":"4c6e6edc-73d1-5cc5-a069-c6c11dc61c74","slug":"/blog/2021/06/10/jenkins-is-the-way-ebook-2/","strippedHtml":"A little over a year ago, we launched JenkinsIsTheWay.io, a website whose sole purpose is to share Jenkins user stories with the developers and engineers in our community.  Over a hundred of you have already shared your innovations, and they just keep coming.  It comes as no surprise that many of the submitted stories are from IT consultants and software developers around the world building next-generation DevOps and CI/CD platforms to fuel the modernization of enterprise companies far and wide.\n\nThat’s why we’ve dedicated our latest eBook to focus on Jenkins users in the global Information Technology sector.  We shine the spotlight on these developers and engineers who have solved unique software development and DevOps challenges by turning to the leading open source automation server.  From powering large enterprises needing a better way to manage their inventory to innovative tech firms looking to advance technologies and healthcare initiatives during a pandemic, you’ll read about how teams everywhere solved their unique challenges — with the help of Jenkins.\n\nJenkins is the Way to…\n\nIn our short User Story Survey, we ask Jenkins users to fill in the blank: Jenkins is the way to …​…​\n\nWe’ve seen results-oriented submissions like \"Jenkins is the way to deliver our new releases on time!\" and \"Jenkins is the way to understand and simplify your software workflows.\"  Several submissions riffed off of something like \"Jenkins is the way to completely automate your CI/CD workflow.\"  Meanwhile, others have had a bit more fun and languished praise on Jenkins, stating, \"Jenkins is the way to help teams focus on what is really important, make our life easier\" and, even, \"Jenkins is the way to save the day.\"\n\nIn this new eBook, we focus on the challenges users in the community face, and what they’ve built using Jenkins to achieve their unique goals. For example, Build & Release Manager, Donald Morton, turned to Jenkins to establish a flexible, modern, and more efficient DevOps platform for Graylog, a leading log management platform serving the enterprise.\n\nWith a Jenkins assist, Mark Baumann, DevOps Engineer with ITK Engineering, created “ one CI to rule them all.” He told us that “Jenkins provides a common CI/CD platform for all different kinds of projects and technology domains.”\n\nWhen IBM Lead Software Engineer Alec Rieger sought to simplify the build and testing pipeline for the company’s software engineers and developers, he also turned to Jenkins.  For a company the size of IBM, which services enterprise clients worldwide, Rieger wanted to help his colleagues manage many nodes on a large scale. Now, according to his Jenkins Is The Way user story, IBM uses Jenkins pipelines for each of their builds and relies on the flexibility and countless plugin features to continually improve their processes.\n\nStronger, Smarter, Faster Software Innovation\n\nWhile we all fondly think of Jenkins as a modest butler who has empowered developers with the open-source tools they need to succeed — on JenkinsIsTheWay.io, we liken him to an unpretentious, yet powerful superhero.  And like any great superhero, he (or she!) is sure to save the day.\n\nFor our Jenkins users, that means results — significant, measurable results with a common theme.  Using Jenkins has enabled you — the user — to help the businesses you serve save money, spin up software faster, and automate processes.  In doing so, you’ve freed up developers and engineers from countless hours of mundane tasks.  Thanks to Jenkins, you’re empowering entire IT teams to innovate, focus on what they love to do and, ultimately, build great stuff.\n\nOf course, we devote much of our latest eBook to those victories.  Results like how RedHat’s releases are 5x faster thanks to Jenkins.  The fact that DevOps problem tickets were reduced by over 90% for Electronic Health Solutions.  And why the CTO at Cloudologia was psyched to share that — with a Jenkins at the helm — they were able to shorten onboarding for deployment & build release cycles from one week to a single day.\n\nShare Your User Story, Too!\n\nI am proud to share another common theme from the users who have submitted their story:  you turn to our community for collaboration, guidance, and advice.  A community of a million strong and growing, this eBook and JenkinsIsTheWay.io are other ways to provide you with the insight and lessons learned by developers and engineers, like you, to innovate and build next-generation technologies for companies of all sizes.\n\nWhen you’re ready to tell your story, we’re prepared to help you share it. Fill out our short questionnaire, and we’ll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt as a thank you once it’s published!\n\nLinks\n\nJenkins IsThe Way.

with Jenkins 2.279 and Jenkins 2.263.4, the Jenkins project is upgrading the base operating system and Java version used in the jenkins/jenkins:latest and jenkins/jenkins:lts images.\nThe update replaces OpenJDK 8u242 with AdoptOpenJDK 8u282 and replaces Debian 9 (\"Stretch\") with Debian 10 (\"Buster\").\n\nWhy?\n\nWe’re changing the base image so that we have a better supported operating system and a more current Java release for Jenkins controllers.\n\nBetter supported operating system\n\nThe Docker images provided by the Jenkins project rely on the operating system security processes of the operating system provider.\n\nOur Docker images have used Debian 9 (\"Stretch\") for multiple years.\nDebian 9 security updates have been discontinued as of July 6, 2020.\nDebian 9 Long Term Support security updates will be discontinued at the end of June 2022.\nThe upgrade to Debian 10 keeps us on an operating system maintained by the operating system security team.\n\nMore current Java release\n\nThe Debian 9 Docker images were based on the openjdk:8-jdk-stretch Docker image.\nThe last update to that image was one year ago with the release of JDK 8u242.\nWe need a maintained Docker base image that keeps pace with JDK releases and operating system updates so that the controller is running the most recent Java updates and most recent operating system updates.\n\nOther Jenkins controller images have already switched from using openjdk base images to instead use base images provided by Eclipse Adoptium.\nEclipse Adoptium is the Eclipse project formed when AdoptOpenJDK joined the Eclipse Foundation.\nThis change adapts the jenkins/jenkins:latest and jenkins/jenkins:lts images to use the Adoptium JDK images in the same pattern as is already used for the Jenkins JDK 11 Docker images like jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11.\nThe Jenkins Platform SIG has enjoyed very good results in our interactions with the Eclipse Adoptium project.\nWe look forward to continuing our collaboration with them.\n\nThanks a lot to Alex Earl and Jim Crowley for the image build restructuring groundwork that made the image upgrade possible!\nAlso thanks to Oleg Nenashev and other contributors for their reviews and testing.\n\nPackaging changes\n\nThe Jenkins Docker image based on Debian 10 (\"Buster\") includes some different packages than Debian 9 (\"Stretch\").\nSome packages have been removed because they are no longer supported by their communities.\nSome packages have been removed due to infrequent and decreasing use.\nUsers of the Jenkins Docker images may need to extend their definition of their Docker image to include packages that are no longer included in the base image.\n\nSCM packages removed\n\nThe following source control management packages are no longer included in the Jenkins controller images for jenkins/jenkins:latest or for jenkins/jenkins:lts :\n\nbzr\n\nmercurial\n\nsubversion\n\nOther packages removed\n\nAdditional packages that are no longer included in the Jenkins controller images include:\n\nbzip2\n\nmime-support\n\npython (the Python project stopped supporting Python 2 January 1, 2020)\n\nxz-utils\n\nA detailed list of the exact package changes is available in the pull request.\n\nUpgrade and compatibility notes\n\nThe Jenkins controller images are designed to be extended to meet user needs.\nCustom Jenkins controller images can be created from the base images and are designed to allow additional Jenkins plugins and additional operating system packages.\n\nFor example, the Installing Docker instructions illustrate a technique to install the Blue Ocean plugins and some operating system packages in a custom Docker image.\n\nDocker image with Subversion\n\nThe following Docker image definition installs the most recent Jenkins Long Term Support release with the subversion plugin and the operating system subversion command:\n\nFROM jenkins/jenkins:lts\nUSER root\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends subversion\nUSER jenkins\nRUN jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins subversion:2.14.0\n\nBuild a new docker image from this Dockerfile and assign the image a meaningful name, e.g. \"myjenkins-subversion:1.1\":\n\ndocker build -t myjenkins-subversion:1.1 .\n\nDocker image with Mercurial\n\nThe following Docker image definition installs the most recent Jenkins Weekly release with the mercurial plugin and the operating system hg command:\n\nFROM jenkins/jenkins:latest\nUSER root\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n

article describes our observations during Windows testing of the Jenkins 2.249.1 release candidate.\n\nUpgrade testing\n\nJenkins 2.249.1 is a new long term support release with user interface improvements and changes in Windows support.\nIt is the first long term support release to drop support for Microsoft.NET framework 2.0.\nThe end of support for Microsoft.NET framework 2.0 was announced in the Windows Support Updates blog post.\nThe Windows support upgrade guidelines describe major things to consider when upgrading Jenkins controllers and agents on Windows.\n\nAs part of our preparation for the release, we tested several configurations.\nThis article describes our experiences with those configurations.\n\nUpgrade approaches\n\nWe tested controller and agent upgrades from Jenkins 2.235.x to 2.249.1-rc on Windows.\nThe tests included:\n\n32 bit Windows MSI\n\n64 bit Windows MSI\n\nWAR (file) on Windows\n\nUpgrade process\n\nOur upgrade process included:\n\nInstall a previous version of Jenkins controller on Windows\n\nInstall a previous version of Jenkins agent on Windows and configure it as a service\n\nUpgrade Jenkins controller from \"Manage Jenkins\"\n\nRestart the Jenkins Windows service for the controller\n\nUpgrade the Jenkins agent on Windows with the latest agent.jar\n\nRestart the Jenkins Windows service for the agent\n\nTesting results\n\nWe successfully tested\n\nRestarting Windows service for controller ( JENKINS-63198)\n\nRestarting Windows service for agents ( JENKINS-63223)\n\nWe confirmed that we can continue our Level 1 support policy for Jenkins 2.249.1.\n\n32 bit Windows MSI\n\nPrior to Jenkins 2.235.3, the Jenkins LTS Windows installer was provided as a 32 bit MSI and included a bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\nThe Jenkins agent can be downloaded and run through Java web start using the bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\nThe agent can also be configured to run as a service using the bundled Java 8 runtime environment.\n\nJenkins controller\n\nJenkins 2.235.1 installs JRE 8u144 for 32 bit Windows.\nThe installer configures the Jenkins controller to run as the SYSTEM user.\n\nRefer to the Windows Installer Updates blog post for details of the controller installation process with the 32 bit MSI.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent starts the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent\n\nThe downloaded file needs to be opened from a command prompt using the javaws command that is included with the bundled JRE:\n\nC:\\> \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Jenkins\\jre\\bin\\javaws.exe\" -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nThe javaws program has been removed from  the most recent releases of Java 8 and from Java 11.\nRefer to [Jenkins agent and icedtea] for a technique that can help users of the most recent releases of Java 8.\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is adjusted to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nUpgrade the controller\n\nThe Jenkins controller on Windows can be upgraded to Jenkins 2.249.1 from the \"Manage Jenkins\" page.\nThe upgrade process downloads the new jenkins.war file, saves the current version in case of later downgrade, and offers to restart.\n\nUpgrade the agent\n\nThe Jenkins inbound agent is not upgraded automatically.\nThe agent administrator downloads the most recent agent.jar from their Jenkins controller, stops the running agent, and replaces the installed agent.jar with the downloaded version.\nThe agent service will reconnect to the Jenkins controller after the administrator restarts it.\n\n64 bit Windows MSI\n\nBeginning with Jenkins 2.235.3, the Jenkins LTS Windows installer is a 64 bit MSI.\nIt runs Jenkins with the 64 bit JDK (Java 8 or Java 11) selected by the user.\n\nJenkins controller\n\nJenkins 2.235.3 was installed using AdoptOpenJDK Java 8u262 in one test.\nIt was installed using AdoptOpenJDK Java 11.0.8 in another test.\nIn both cases, the installer configured the Jenkins controller to run with the Windows service account we had previously configured.\n\nRefer to the Windows Installer Updates blog post for details of the controller installation process with the 64 bit MSI.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\nOnce the Jenkins TCP port is open for inbound agents, a new agent is configured from the Jenkins \"Nodes\" menu\nThis creates an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent was started the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent with IcedTea-Web\n\nRecent versions of Java 8 and all versions of Java 11 have removed the javaws command.\nJenkins agents for Java 8 can still be started with the javaws command, but it needs to be downloaded separately from the JVM.\nWe open \"slave-agent.jnlp\" from a command prompt using the javaws command that is available from AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea :\n\nC:\\> C:\\icedtea-web-1.8.3.win.bin\\icedtea-web-image\\bin\\javaws.exe -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is installed and configured to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nUpgrading the controller\n\nThe Jenkins controller on Windows was upgraded to Jenkins 2.249.1 from the \"Manage Jenkins\" page.\nThe upgrade process downloads the new jenkins.war file, saves the current version in case of later downgrade, and offers to restart.\n\nUpgrading the agent\n\nThe Jenkins inbound agent is not upgraded automatically or from a Jenkins user interface.\nThe agent administrator downloads the most recent agent.jar from their Jenkins controller and replaces the installed agent.jar with the downloaded version.\n\nWAR (file) on Windows\n\nJenkins allows users to run the Jenkins web archive (WAR) file from a command line and then install it as a service from within Jenkins.\nThis installation technique uses the Jenkins WAR file but does not use a Windows MSI package.\nThe Jenkins WAR file includes the necessary components to install and configure Jenkins as a service.\n\nInstall controller as a service\n\nWhen the Jenkins war file is started from a Windows command prompt, \"Manage Jenkins\" includes \"Install as a service\".\nAn administrator selects that entry and Jenkins will configure itself to run as a service/\nThe installer configures the Jenkins controller to run as the SYSTEM user.\n\nJenkins agent\n\nJenkins agents on Windows are often configured to \"Launch agent by connecting it to the master\".\nThe Jenkins agent configuration correctly warns that the controller must open the TCP port for inbound agents in the \"Configure Global Security\" page.\nIt is easiest to allow Jenkins to choose the port (a \"Random\" port).\nJenkins selects a random available port number and shares that port number with agents during their initial connection to the Jenkins http port.\n\nConfigure the agent\n\nAfter opening the Jenkins TCP port for inbound agents, we configured a new agent from the \"Nodes\" menu\nThis created an \"inbound Jenkins agent\" that uses the Jenkins agent.jar to initiate the connection to the Jenkins controller.\n\nDownload the agent\n\nThe agent was started the first time by clicking the \"Launch\" button on the agent configuration page (only available with Java 8).\nThat downloads the \"slave-agent.jnlp\" file from the web browser.\n\nStart the agent with IcedTea-Web\n\nRecent versions of Java 8 and all versions of Java 11 have removed the javaws command.\nJenkins agents for Java 8 can still be started with the javaws command, but it needs to be downloaded separately from the JVM.\nOpen \"slave-agent.jnlp\" from a command prompt using the javaws command that is available from AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea-Web :\n\nC:\\> C:\\icedtea-web-1.8.3.win.bin\\icedtea-web-image\\bin\\javaws.exe -wait slave-agent.jnlp\n\nJava web start (javaws.exe) prompts for permission to run the program with this dialog:\n\nInstall the agent as a service\n\nThe agent runs and displays a window on the desktop with a single menu entry, \"Install as a service\".\n\nWhen the \"Install as a service\" menu item is clicked, the agent is installed and configured to run as a Windows service using the SYSTEM account.\n\nConclusion\n\nJenkins controller installation is best done with the new 64 bit MSI package.\nPrevious controller installations can be upgraded to the most recent Jenkins release from within Jenkins.\n\nJenkins inbound agent installation is more complicated now that the javaws.exe program is not included in the JDK.\nThe AdoptOpenJDK IcedTea-Web project allows administrators to install and configure Jenkins inbound agents with most of the ease that was available in prior Java releases.","title":"Testing Jenkins 2.249.1 on
