Over 250 people showed up. It was, to be completely honest, a bit shocking to me - that little project I’d gotten involved with less than three years earlier was big enough, interesting enough, important enough for 250 people to travel from around the world to spend a day talking about it? That’s an amazing feeling, and it was an amazing day. Since then, there’ve been three more JUCs in the Bay Area, three in Israel and two in Europe, with more talks on more Jenkins subjects and an ever-increasing number of attendees. This year, there are another four scheduled - three of them for two days each this time! Find out more about the first two, JUC US East and JUC Europe, below!\n\n+\n+\n\nNot only are there enough worthy talks to merit a full day a few times a year - now there are enough to merit two days! At JUC US East 2015 outside Washington, DC on June 18 and 19, you can see talks on the Workflow plugin for Jenkins, test automation, mobile testing, plugin development, and a few talks on new and fascinating ways people are using Jenkins - even driving big data workflows! And then, just a few days later, on June 23 and 24 in London, there’s JUC Europe 2015, with talks covering things like the fantastic Job DSL plugin, reproducible build environments, Jenkins and Docker together, and my personal favorite, the 2015 edition of my Seven Habits of Highly Effective Jenkins Users talk.\n\n+\n+\n\nWhether you’re interested in the latest innovations in continuous integration and delivery, or you’re a Jenkins plugin developer wanting to learn how to make your plugins more mature and useful, or you’re a Jenkins administrator trying to understand how to provide your users with a great platform for their builds and testing, or even if you’ve just heard about CI/CD and you want to find out more, the Jenkins User Conferences are a great opportunity to see all those things and meet with other Jenkins users and developers. I’m excited to attend my fifth JUC in London, and I hope to see you there!\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nimage:https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/smallerme.jpeg[image,width=150,height=188] +\n\n+\n\nThis post is by Andrew Bayer, build and tools architect at Cloudera and longtime Jenkins contributor.

One script is one job, and as you repeatedly execute jobs, it creates builds as records. As the use case of Jenkins gets more sophisticated, people started combining jobs to orchestrate ever more complex activities.\n\nA number of plugins have been developed to enable all sorts of different ways to compose jobs, and many are used quite successfully in production. But this resulted in a certain degree of complexity for users to figure out how to assemble these plugins.\n\nSo we felt the need to develop a single unified solution that subsumes all these different ways to orchestrate activities that may span across multiple build agents, code repositories, etc. Various inputs from users as well as other plugin developers played a key role.\n\nThe result of this is the workflow plugin, which is what a number of us, including Jesse Glick an myself, are focused on in the past few months.\n\nThe plugin approaches the problem by defining a DSL for you to describe an execution of a job. Various convenient primitives are available, such as executing shell scripts, checking out the source code, obtaining an executor or a build workspace, etc. All sorts of classic existing plugins contribute their functionalities into this DSL, such as recording test results, fingerprints, or calling into other existing jobs. This allows you to leverage higher-level functionalities and report comprehension capability into a workflow. Similarly, you can leverage the ability of Groovy, the host language of workflow DSL, to define control flows, abstractions, and reuse.\n\nA key feature of a workflow execution is that it’s suspendable. That is, while the workflow is running your script, you can shut down Jenkins or lose a connectivity to a agent. When it comes back, Jenkins will still remember what it was doing, and your workflow script resumes execution as if it was never interrupted. A technique known as the \" continuation-passing style\" execution plays a key role in achieving this.\n\nI’m very happy to report that the workflow plugin is finally 1.0. This version runs on the latest 1.580-based LTS. and we created a docker image for you to play with too. There’s also a JUC presentation that explains this. We are working toward 1.0 release within this year, and in the meantime, the syntax is stable enough to allow you to start designing workflows today.\n\nWe’ve been hearing a lot of good feedbacks and enthusiasm for this new effort. Please let us know what you think.","title":"Workflow plugin is 1.0","tags":["development","plugins","pipeline","workflow"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","id":"82c1a380-6078-5f29-8221-cf155abbbdb4","slug":"/blog/2014/09/17/jenkins-workflow-summit-rsvp/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/jenkinsci-dev/qY387kOQlW8/vaBxacXYhGwJ[As was discussed some time ago], the workflow summit is being organized, and it's open for RSVP. +\n +\n\n+\nDue to the overwhelming demand, I've increased the capacity this time to 50, but this is an unconference where everyone needs to participate, which means we really cannot have too many people without changing the dynamics of the event. +\n +\n\n+\nSo please make sure you are willing to participate, as in not just listening and watching, but actually willing to speak.
