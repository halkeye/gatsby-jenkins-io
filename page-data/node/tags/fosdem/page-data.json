There will be no user-focused topics (no presentations, no trainings, etc.) but we will focus on defining key priorities for the project, building a roadmap and resolving issues we have in the project at the moment.\nWe’ll end up the day with our now traditional Orval and flemish beef stew at Le Roy d’Espagne\n\nFinally the FOSDEM, the 01 and 02 of February, we’ll all be at FOSDEM. So come and say \"hi\" at the Jenkins/JenkinsX stand, inside the CICD Devroom.\n\nOr just come and share beers\n\nCheers","title":"FOSDEM 2020 is coming","tags":["fosdem","events","community","outreach-programs"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f6d731c7e61ff5c7f0ddc7f2b8a6671e/bf8e1/olblak.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f6d731c7e61ff5c7f0ddc7f2b8a6671e/914ee/olblak.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f6d731c7e61ff5c7f0ddc7f2b8a6671e/1c9ce/olblak.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f6d731c7e61ff5c7f0ddc7f2b8a6671e/bf8e1/olblak.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f6d731c7e61ff5c7f0ddc7f2b8a6671e/acb7c/olblak.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f6d731c7e61ff5c7f0ddc7f2b8a6671e/ef6ff/olblak.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f6d731c7e61ff5c7f0ddc7f2b8a6671e/8257c/olblak.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f6d731c7e61ff5c7f0ddc7f2b8a6671e/6766a/olblak.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f6d731c7e61ff5c7f0ddc7f2b8a6671e/22bfc/olblak.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"olblak","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Olivier is the Jenkins infrastructure officer and Senior Operations Engineer at CloudBees.\nAs a regular contributor to the Jenkins infrastructure projects, he works on a wide range of tasks from services reliability to applications maintenance.</p>\n</div>","id":"olblak","irc":"olblak","linkedin":null,"name":"Olivier Vernin","slug":"/blog/author/olblak","twitter":"0lblak"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2018-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","id":"722f0200-64bd-58bf-8505-41094f0be2dd","slug":"/blog/2018/01/26/fosdem-hackaton/","strippedHtml":"On the first weekend in February, numerous free and open source developers from around the\nworld will travel to Brussels, Belgium, for arguably the largest event of its kind:\nFOSDEM.\nAmong the thousands of hackers in attendance will be a number of Jenkins contributors.\n\nOn the Monday after FOSDEM,\nyou are invited to join a group of those contributors for a full day of hacking on Jenkins.\nFolks of all experience levels are welcome;\nthere will be sessions for everyone from seasoned hackers to new contributors.\n\nAll-day Jenkins Hackfest\n\nThe Hackfest will start at 9:30am on Monday with general introductions and gathering of potential topics/projects.\nBring suggestions for topics that interest you, or just come and choose from the topics others suggest.\nThere will be plenty of topics from which to choose.\nAll the topic suggestions will all be added to a backlog and we will identify and cluster around popular topics.\nThen we’ll divide into smaller groups and work on individual topics in timeboxed sessions.\n\nMeals, snacks, and beverages will be provided throughout the day, wrapping up with dinner around 5pm.\n\nSomething for everyone\n\nHackfests like this one are a great opportunity for contributors of all levels to get invovled, learn from each other, and\nwork together on interesting and high impact areas of the project.\n\nSome long-time contributors already know what areas they’ll work on and are looking for people interested in joining them.\nMark Waite (maintainer of the Jenkins Git and Git Client plugins) and Christian Halstrick (SAP) will be spending the day improving the way Git client plugin uses JGit.\nR.

Among the thousands of hackers in attendance\nwere a dozen or so Jenkins contributors. We have attended the event in the\npast, but this year we had a blizzard of activity spanning four days around the FOSDEM\nweekend.\n\nFigure 1. City Hall, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nOne of our \"accidental traditions\" has become a\nhappy hour\nthe Friday night before FOSDEM truly begins at Cafe Le Roy d’Espagne on Grand\nPlace right in the middle of Brussels. Conveniently located a few hundred meters away from the\nFOSDEM Beer Event\nat Delirium Cafe, each year we are inevitably joined by friends from other open\nsource projects who know they’re welcome to join us for a few drinks.\n\nFigure 2. Cafe Le Roy, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nAfter dinner and drinks, a few of us decided it would be a good idea (it\nwasn’t) to walk over to check out the FOSDEM Beer Event and maybe have just\none more beer. For the uninitiated, Belgian beers tend to be strong, as the FOSDEM organizers warn:\n\nUnlike some other beers, Belgian beer is not just coloured water. Some beers\ncontain significant quantities of alcohol and will give you a pounding\nhangover.\n\nUnfortunately, some of us seem to re-learn this lesson each year at FOSDEM!\n\nBright and early the following day, FOSDEM really kicked off with keynotes and\nthe project tables lining a number of corridors.\n\nFigure 3. A busy hall at FOSDEM, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nAt the Jenkins project’s table we typically spend two full days answering questions,\nshowing off the latest and greatest Jenkins features, and of course handing out\nJenkins stickers. The table is where many contributors, myself included, have\na rare opportunity to talk with dozens of enthusiastic Jenkins users from\nacross the broader open source community. This year we were very fortunate to have a\ntremendous number of contributors available at the table to answer hundreds of\nquestions throughout the two days of FOSDEM.\n\nI would like to thank everybody by name, but the entire weekend was such a blur\nthat I’m not sure I would be able to remember everybody who helped! We couldn’t have\nhad a successful event without their support, so many thanks to all the\ncontributors who helped!\n\nIn addition to the Jenkins project table, we had two contributors present in\nthe\nTesting and Automation\ndevroom, which I helped organize in between answering Jenkins questions.\n\nDeclarative Pipelines in Jenkins\n\nThe first presentation was a stellar introduction to\nDeclarative Pipelines\nin Jenkins, by long-time contributor and primary developer of Declarative\nPipeline support,\nAndrew Bayer.\n\nUsing Containers for Building and Testing\n\nLater in the day,\nCarlos Sanchez,\nanother long-time contributor, maintainer of the\nKubernetes plugin and a number of Jenkins- and Maven-related\nDocker containers, provided a great overview of the current state of using\ncontainers for building and testing in Jenkins.\n\nAfter a very busy two days at FOSDEM, a few contributors remained in Brussels\nfor a day-long\nPost-FOSDEM Contributor Hackathon\nsponsored by CloudBees, Inc. and\nBetacowork Brussels. Trying to cram lots of\nhacking into a single day is challenging, so the day was mostly filled with\ndiscussions, some light prototyping, and a bit of recovery from the hectic\nweekend at FOSDEM. :)\n\nFigure 4. Daniel Beck presenting on CLI prototyping, photo by Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n\nThanks\n\nOf course I would like to extend many thanks to all the contributors who\nparticipated in the various FOSDEM related events, but I would call special\nattention to the logistics and planning work done by contributors Alyssa Tong,\nDamien Duportal, and Olivier Vernin. Thanks to their work coordinating all the\nplans, reservations, and schedules, we had a flawless weekend\nof high-intensity Jenkins discussion, advocacy, and hacking.\n\nI hope to see everybody back in Brussels next year for FOSDEM 2018!","title":"FOSDEM 2017 Wrap-up","tags":["fosdem","event"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
