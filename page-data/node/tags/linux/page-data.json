Done\nW: GPG error: https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ Release:\n    The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:\n        NO_PUBKEY FCEF32E745F2C3D5\nE: The repository 'https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ Release' is not signed.\nN: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.\nN: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.\n\nRed Hat/CentOS\n\nDownloading packages:\nwarning: /var/cache/yum/x86_64/7/jenkins/packages/jenkins-2.235.3-1.1.noarch.rpm:\n    Header V4 RSA/SHA512 Signature, key ID 45f2c3d5: NOKEY\nPublic key for jenkins-2.235.3-1.1.noarch.rpm is not installed\n\nWhy is the repository signing key being updated?\n\nThe original repository GPG signing key is owned by Kohsuke Kawaguchi.\nRather than require that Kohsuke disclose his personal GPG signing key, the core release automation project has used a new repository signing key.\nThe updated GPG repository signing key is used in the weekly repositories and the stable repositories.\n\nWhich operating systems are affected?\n\nOperating systems that use Debian package management (apt) and operating systems that use Red Hat package management (yum and dnf) need the new repository signing key.\n\nOther operating systems like Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and OpenIndiana are not affected.\n\nAre there other signing changes?\n\nYes, there are other signing changes, though they do not need specific action from users.\n\nThe jenkins.war file is signed with a new code signing certificate.\nThe new code signing certificate has been used on weekly releases since April 2020.","title":"Jenkins 2.235.3: New Linux Repository Signing Keys","tags":["announcement","linux","platform"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"markewaite","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Mark is the <a href=\"/project/team-leads/#documentation\">Jenkins Documentation Officer</a>, a long-time Jenkins user and contributor, and maintains the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/git\">git plugin</a> and the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client\">git client plugin</a>.\nHe is active in <a href=\"/sigs/\">Jenkins special interest groups</a> including the <a href=\"/sigs/docs/\">Docs SIG</a>, <a href=\"/sigs/platform\">Platform SIG</a>, and <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach\">Advocacy SIG</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"markewaite","irc":"markewaite","linkedin":"markwaite","name":"Mark Waite","slug":"/blog/author/markewaite","twitter":"MarkEWaite"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"linux","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
