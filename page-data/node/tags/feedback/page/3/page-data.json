The growth in the Jenkins community since the first JUC is astounding.\n\nEvery year we are in search of a larger venue to accommodate the larger crowd. For 2014, the challenge of finding a venue for a capacity of 500+ attendees at a low cost will prove even more daunting. We would love to hear your suggestions for low cost venues (in the Bay Area) so that we may continue to keep entry cost low while providing convenience and the highest level of Jenkins education to attendees. Please send suggestion(s) to events@lists.jenkins-ci.org\n\nWe are proud to launch the call for volunteers to join the JUC organizing committee (OC). If you are interested in shaping the 4th edition of this great event, please send email to events@lists.jenkins-ci.org\n\nWe encourage you to share this blog within your network in case other people\nwould be interested in joining the JUC OC or have ideas for a great JUC 2014 location.","title":"JUC: Call for Volunteers to Join the Organizing Committee (and Venues!)","tags":["general","feedback","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3e06cc8d-87c3-5968-b579-1eed57d37062","slug":"/blog/2013/09/05/extreme-feedback-lamp-switch-gear-style/","strippedHtml":"+\nThis is a guest post by https://twitter.com/dvaske[Aske Olsson] +\n +\n\n+\nExtreme feedback is an incredibly powerful way to drive quality and accelerate your developer fast feedback loop. +\n +\n\n+\nHaving eXtreme Feedback Devices (XFDs) hooked up to your Jenkins jobs gives everyone on your team instant insight into the current software state. At customer after customer we've seen extreme feedback devices drive significant incremental productivity gains, so about a year ago we started talking about taking the concept mainstream and making it easily available to any development team. So, as a small side-project, we've decided to scratch our own itch and developed an easy-to-deploy, Linux-based, laser-cut, extreme feedback device, specifically designed for Jenkins. It infers a feeling of urgency when the build is broken, and a better sense of a achievement once the problem is fixed. Just connect the XFD to your network, install the \"extreme feedback plugin\" on your Jenkins server and configure which jobs to feedback extremely. +\n +\n +\n\n+\nAt the Jenkins Code Camp in Copenhagen today (with Kohsuke) we've made the lamp speak the name of the developer who broke the build :), improved the plugin's UI in Jenkins, and gotten the the lamp's display to list all the developers who contributed to the last change. Of course you can contribute too, just fork the repositories at https://github.com/switchgears/extremefeedbacklamp[here] and https://github.com/switchgears/extreme-feedback-plugin[here] and create a pull request. +\n +\n\n+\nIf you're interested in trying out extreme feedback in your own team you can order https://web.archive.org/web/20180826231109/https://gitgear.com/xfd/[your own XFD lamp] +\n +\n\n+","title":"Extreme Feedback Lamp, Switch Gear style","tags":["development","feedback","guest post","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"ed0ec999-88b5-523c-8e18-21dc59122d1c","slug":"/blog/2013/08/01/2-version-control-plugins-in-beta-testing-before-a-major-release/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Testing22222.jpg[image,width=150,height=160] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nhttps://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Git+plugin+2.0+beta+testing[Git plugin] and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/TFS+plugin+2.0+beta+testing[TFS plugin] are calling for interested parties to try out their 2.0 beta binaries before they get released. +\n +\n\n+\nGit plugin 2.0 contains a major refactoring and UI simplifications, and TFS plugin contains a rewritten polling logic that does not require a workspace. +\n +\n\n+\nIf you think you'd benefit from these changes, please head to their respective beta testing page and try out the new bits, while we can still change them.","title":"2 version control plugins in beta testing before a major release","tags":["development","feedback","releases","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d09b3edf-14fb-5979-adf4-e44e21565cba","slug":"/blog/2013/05/06/giving-back-to-the-community-3-ways-to-keep-jenkins-growing/","strippedHtml":"With more than 600 plugins, Jenkins has a vibrant community and we’re dependent on YOU to keep it that way. Here are 3 ways you can give back to the community to ensure that everyone benefits and Jenkins keeps growing…​\n\nGiving it back to the community #1: vendor+community=win\n\n+\nJenkins is becoming ubiquitous enough that tool vendors and service providers often find their users asking them to provide Jenkins plugins. The challenge for these companies is that they don’t necessarily possess the necessary Jenkins expertise to do one. +\n +\n\n+\nHere at the Jenkins project, what we are trying to do is to work with these people to deliver a plugin. It gets the job done a whole lot more quickly if the vendor brings in their expertise on their tool/services and we bring in our expertise on Jenkins plugin development. +\n +\n\n+\nFor example, we recently worked with https://www.soasta.com/press-releases/soasta-and-cloudbees-partner-to-deliver-first-jenkins-plugin-for-continuous-integration-on-mobile-platforms/[SOASTA] to help them open-source the plugin they developed in house, then help them add a whole bunch of new functionalities. By open-sourcing a plugin in the Jenkins project, vendors win as the community helps fix bugs and improve plugins. The Jenkins project wins by building relationship with vendors. And finally the users win by having more integrations. +\n +\n\n+\nSo the next time you ask your vendor to provide a Jenkins integration, please tell them to drop us a note, and we are happy to talk. +\n +\n\nGiving it back to the community #2: scratch your itch and take credit\n\n+\n\n+\nIf you are working for a company and hacking some Jenkins plugins for your team, then you should definitely consider contributing those changes back. Let’s take https://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/11/22/sony-contributes-to-jenkins-software-tool/[Robert and Tomas] for example, who contributed a number of significant plugins from Sony Mobile. +\n +\n\n+\nThe company wins, because it shows off their technical excellence. Plus the flexibility to let engineers work on these OSS projects helps them retain and attract high-caliber developers. It also lets the community shoulder some of the burdens of maintaining plugins.\n\n+\nYou win, because now you have more things to show to future employers. After all, GitHub is your new resume! And when you aren’t sure how to go about implementing a feature or fixing a bug, open-sourcing your plugin lets us jump in and get you unstuck.\n\n+\nThe community wins, thanks to your new awesome plugin.\n\n+\nBesides all of those pragmatic reasons, when you share something with others and they tell you how much it helped them, even if it’s just one or two people, it’s a deeply moving experience.\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIt just has so many advantages, it’s a no brainer! +\n +\n\nGiving it back to the community #3: contribute by proxy\n\n+\n\n+\nIf you are working for a company, wanting to see particular features/integrations in Jenkins but don’t have time to do it yourself, there’s yet another way, and that’s to contribute by proxy. +\n +\n\n+\nThe idea is that you contract with those who already know how to develop Jenkins plugins, and you have them produce/improve Jenkins plugins in open-source. https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Praqma[Praqma] is a great example of one such company. They are well connected in the community, with lots of experience under their belts, and your company takes the credit for the work. There are also a number of individuals who can do this for you. +\n +\n\n+\nWhy give it away something for free when you paid for it, you might ask. That’s because the code sitting in house rots when it’s not maintained by anybody. In contrast, when the rest of the world can hack on your code, you get occasional random bug fixes by strangers (the worst case), and sometimes it gets its own life (the best case.) +\n +\n\n+\nIf this way of giving back suits you better, feel free to send an e-mail to https://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html[the dev list].","title":"Giving Back to the Community:  3 Ways to Keep Jenkins Growing","tags":["development","core","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","id":"1173321c-3ce3-53dc-b412-a8ab044439ff","slug":"/blog/2013/01/09/2012-jenkins-survey-results-are-in/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://rhetoricalcommons.org/OSAAC/sites/default/files/images/survey.jpg[image] +\n\n+\n\n+\nThe https://jenkins-ci.org/node/403[Jenkins survey] we’ve been running since https://jenkins-ci.org/content/come-join-jenkins-user-conference-san-francisco-september-30th[the Jenkins User Conference in San Francisco] has concluded. All in all we counted 721 responses --- thanks everyone for voicing their thoughts! +\n +\n\n+\nNaturally, it took a while to tally that many responses, but thanks to https://twitter.com/ProductPrincipl[Lisa], we https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb[now have the result] in time for the holiday. +\n +\n\n+\nAs you can see in https://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/total-jenkins.svg[our installation tracking], Jenkins installation base has grown 66% since the last year, so I was naturally very curious if this has affected the area of focus for us the developers. +\n +\n\n+\nHowever, when https://pages.cloudbees.com/Jenkins_Survey_2011_JenkinsSurveyDownloadPage.html[compared to the result from the last year], the first thing I notice is the consistency in many metrics. For example, about 83% of people considers Jenkins mission critical this year, and the last year it was 82%. The distribution between beginner/intermediate/expert users are also quite similar. +\n +\n\n+\nBut this year, we asked a number of questions that we didn’t ask the last year. One of them is the version control systems that people use. Here, we get 61% Subversion, 50% Git, and everything else is within 10%. So clearly we need to start shipping Git plugin pre-bundled! +\n +\n\n+\nAnother interesting question that we asked is the languages people use. There’s a surprising number of C/C++ projects on Jenkins (and good number of Ruby, PHP, Python, and C#!), which made me feel that we need to hear more from those users about the kind of tool integrations we need to be providing. +\n +\n\n+\nOne more gem is that whopping 11% of the respondents said they have written and contributed plugins to the community (that’s 82 people!), and another 9% of the respondents said they wrote one but just not sharing it because it doesn’t make sense (7%), or they couldn’t (2%). That’s about 1 in every 5 respondents writing some plugins, which is amazing, if you ask me. +\n +\n\n+\nAnother big part of the survey was asking respondents what are important in Jenkins --- is it documentation, quality, UI, etc? But I guess I shouldn’t spoil your fun of actually https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb[looking at the result], so please go take a look yourself! Also, if you want to tally the numbers yourself, here’s the anonymized raw data. +\n +\n\n+\nI’ll hopefully do a separate post on the efforts we are taking to answer those points raised in the survey in coming days. +","title":"2012 Jenkins Survey results are in","tags":["general","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","id":"8b87be41-1fcb-53eb-9ced-f72c5ac77bb6","slug":"/blog/2012/11/18/comunidade-verde-amarela-do-jenkins-uni-vos/","strippedHtml":"O Jenkins, servidor de integração favorito de todos, é muito utilizado no Brasil, e agora tem uma lista de e-mails em Português além do primeiro encontro de usuários Jenkins no Brasil.

Obviously, the developers in the project deal with https://issues.jenkins.io[individual bug reports and feature requests] all the time, but sometimes those day-to-day issues distract you from a bigger picture. +\n +\n\n+\nThis year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend. But we also http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2012/jenkins.2012-09-19-18.00.log.html#l-142[discussed what we wanted to ask] among ourselves and revised some more. +\n +\n\n+\nThe tricky thing about being an open-source project is that it's not like some of us can actually decide what we'll be working on — in the end it's up to individual contributors to decide what they want to work on. So I can't make promises, but in a way, that's precisely why we'd like to get these objective, measurable, quantitative feedbacks. It lets us discuss how to solve the problem, instead of spending time discussing what the problem is. +\n +\n\n+\nLast year, we've heard loud and clear that people wanted to see some UI improvements. So a bunch of us sit down at link:/blog/2012/02/21/fosdem-2012-recap/[FOSDEM], picked up several key UI improvements, and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/UI+Enhancements[we've actually delivered on those].
