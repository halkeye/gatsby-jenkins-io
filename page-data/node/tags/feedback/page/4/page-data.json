But this time, we hope to have a good number of users to the meeting, not just project insiders. So if you have things you’d like to get users feedback on, or if you like project insiders to update you on things, please don’t hesitate to add them.\n\nI still need to work on the logistics, but the plan is to do a cross-over with IRC — I’d like to show the IRC client projected in the room, so that people in the room can see the conversation in IRC, and I’d like either real-time transcribing of voice conversations to IRC and/or live broadcasting of the room.","title":"Jenkins project meeting in the meat space / Call for agenda","tags":["general","feedback","meetup","javaone","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3b137401-523e-529a-993b-5811f4a262ab","slug":"/blog/2012/05/28/jenkins-a-besoin-de-vous/","strippedHtml":"[ Editor’s Note : The following is a guest post by Jenkins contributor Baptiste Mathus. For the non-French speakers, we’re looking for French speakers to help translate \"Jenkins: The Definitive Guide\" ]\n\nSi vous vous intéressez à Jenkins et que vous aimeriez pouvoir y contribuer, lisez la suite.\n\nL’année dernière, en août, nous avons attaqué la traduction en français du Jenkins Definitive Guide, écrit en bonne partie par John Ferguson Smart. Le travail a avancé doucement, mais a avancé tout de même. A ce jour, sur la quinzaine de\nchapitres, trois sont traduits et relus, et presque tout le reste est en cours.\n\nMais je ne parle pas bien anglais…​\n\nCe n’est pas grave. Il y a plusieurs chapitres où il faut simplement relire, et donc parler et écrire correctement le français est suffisant. Si éventuellement, vous ne comprenez pas certaines parties traduites, et qu’il faut relire l’original, vous pouvez toujours soulever la question sur la liste de diffusion du projet où on parle français.\n\nJe ne suis pas développeur, ou je ne connais pas Git, ou les deux\n\nSi vous voulez vous former à Git, c’est l’occasion. On se fera un plaisir de répondre à vos questions sur la liste de diffusion, même si elles sont exclusivement liées à Git, et pas (encore) à la traduction :-).\n\nMais si vous ne le sentez pas ou n’avez pas le temps, ce n’est pas grave. Vous devez simplement savoir éditer un fichier XML. Il y en a un pour chaque chapitre.\n\nSuper ! Par où je commence alors ?\n\nComment se signaler :\n\nIl y a une page wiki qui récapitule l’état de la traduction, chapitre par chapitre. Indiquez votre nom en tant que relecteur, et c’est parti.\n\nSi vous le souhaitez, mais ce n’est pas une obligation, vous pouvez vous présenter sur la liste de diffusion du projet.\n\nComment relire les chapitres ?\n\nLe plus simple est de lire la version HTML publiée en continu grâce à CloudBees.\n\nComment faire part de mes corrections ? Deux solutions :\n\nGit : vous forkez le projet GitHub : Jenkins - Le Guide Complet, vous créez une branche pour la relecture, vous committez vos vos corrections, et vous faites une pull-request.\n\nCopiez le fichier XML du chapitre qui vous intéresse à partir de la page du projet puis vous l’envoyez sur la liste de diffusion lorsque vous avez fini.\n\nSi vous êtes intéressé, mais que vous avez des questions, surtout n’hésitez pas à les poser.\n\nOn vous attend ! :-)","title":"Jenkins a besoin de vous","tags":["general","feedback","guest post"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
