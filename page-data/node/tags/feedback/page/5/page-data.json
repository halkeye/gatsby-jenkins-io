Behold, the first release of Hudson ever made by a not-employed-by-Sun Kohsuke (as we covered last week). This iteration of Hudson contains only bug fixes, check the listing below for the specifics on which bugs have been fixed (1.355 is looking like it will contain a number of fixes as well). The release of 1.354 comes slightly later than usual given some of the logistics that needed to, or still need to be resolved.\n\nOne of the infrastructure issues that’s half-way resolved is the question of Debian/Ubuntu packages. Kohuske has packages uploaded in an experimental apt repository on hudson-labs.org which you can try out. That said, it’s not entirely clear whether this is going to be the preferred means of distributing native Debian/Ubuntu packages in the future (your mileage may vary).\n\nBugs fixed\n\nPOM parsing was still using the module root as the base for relative paths for alternate settings files. ( issue 6080)\n\nFix dynamic updates of build history table when CSRF protection is turned on. ( issue 6072)\n\nImproved the error reporting mechanism in LDAP setting.\n\nRaw console output contains garbage. ( issue 6034)\n\nFixed a file handle leak in the agents connection. ( issue 6137)\n\nQuiet period wasn’t taking effect properly when doing parameterized builds.\n\nContributors\n\nThe release of 1.354 contains a total of 51 commits to the \"core\" part of the tree, from 9 different contributors\n\nabayer\n\ndrulli\n\nkohsuke\n\nmanuel_carrasco\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nswiest\n\nvlatombe\n\nwyukawa\n+\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.354 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links","releases"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

One of the positive changes that came out shortly after the meet up was the support for \"Concurrent Builds\", allowing a job to be executed concurrently on different agents, a precursor to pre-tested commit support. Fervor for the pre-tested commit feature lowered as time went on, the feature being too dependent on the SCM itself was generally accepted as the reasoning behind the feature languishing.\n\nChances are the feature is in fact too large for Hudson to support alone. It requires Hudson, the SCM and likely a third tool to work in concert together to perform such a feat.\n\nWith Git, and the phenomenal code review tool Gerrit, and the Gerrit plugin by intrepid plugin developer, Jyrki Puttonen, pre-tested commits with Hudson, Git and Gerrit are possible.\nFor Git users more familiar with the distributed Git workflows, working with Gerrit should seem familiar. Gerrit has JGit, a Java implementation of Git embedded within it, along with an sshd stack, meaning Gerrit can masquerade as a \"regular\" Git remote repository. Developers can push and pull to the repository just as they can with any other Git repository (provided they have permissions of course). I won’t delve too much into using Gerrit specifically here, but the pre-tested workflow with Gerrit and Hudson would look something like this:\n\nDev creates a topic branch to work on a change\n\nCode is written (and hopefully tested) and committed locally\n\nDev pushes commit(s) to Gerrit\n\nHudson job (set to Poll SCM) picks up the patch, runs the job and marks it as \"+1 Verified\" or \"-1 Fails\"\n\nIf the job fails or is unstable, the change should be reworked or corrected (typically with git-rebase(1))\n\nIf Hudson says the change is good to go, it can be cherry-picked or pulled directly from Gerrit.\n\nFor example: image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/gerrit_patch.png\n\nTo learn more about Gerrit, check out the project page on Google Code; information on the Gerrit plugin can be found on the wiki.","title":"Pre-tested commits with Git","tags":["infrastructure","feedback","jobs","tutorial"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

I say that he is leaving Sun, instead of leaving Oracle as Kohsuke worked at Sun for nine years and Oracle only a few months. In those nine years at Sun, Kohsuke has worked on some great products, the most notable of them being Hudson.\n\nPer Kohsuke’s post:\n\nWhere am I heading next? I’m actually starting my own company to take Hudson to the next stage.\n\nWhat this means for Hudson still isn’t certain yet, fortunately it means that Hudson will continue to have at least one full-time developer. It remains to be seen where KohsukeCorp (the name has not yet been disclosed) will focus within the Hudson code-base. For the greater user-base of Hudson, this means that the schedule for releases may slow down during this transitional period, there are some logistics to work out with Oracle regarding some of the hardware Hudson has traditionally used to host JIRA, this blog, and a number of other machines helping support the Hudson project in one fashion or another.\n\nThe next couple of months will be interesting for the Hudson community; as per usual you’ll be able to get the latest updates from this blog or the @hudsonci twitter account. I’ll let Kohsuke finish this post off:\n\nAnd finally, big thank you to everyone in the Hudson community, and in a broader java.net community.

( issue 5899)\n\nReplace '>' with '_' in username, as already done for '<'. ( issue 5833)\n\nFix editableComboBox to select item when mouse click takes more than 100ms. ( issue 2722)\n\nFixed NPE when configuring a view without \"Regular expression\".\n\nPage shouldn’t scroll up when the user opens/closes a stack trace in the test failure report.\n\nFixed a bug where Hudson can put a wrong help file link. ( report)\n\nFixed Maven site goal archiving from agents. ( issue 5943)\n\nFixed a regression with NetBeans Hudson plugin progressive console output. ( issue 5941)\n\nFixed a situation where a failure in plugin start up can prevent massive number of job loss.\n\nEnhancements\n\nSupported JBoss EAP 5.0.0 GA. ( issue 5922)\n\nCLI commands on protected Hudson now asks a password interactively, if run on Java6.\n\nAdded CLI 'login' and 'logout' commands so that you don’t have to specify a credential for individual CLI invocation.\n\nURLs in the console output are now hyperlinks.\n\nImproved the URL annotation logic.\n\nAdd drag&drop support for f:repeatable lists and use this for the JDK/Ant/Maven installations in global config so these can be reordered.\n\nIntegrated a new round of community-contributed localizations (ca, es, fi, fr, hi_IN, it, nl, ru, and sv_SE locales.)\n\nContributors\n\nThis release contains 63 commits, from six different contributors including our very own Subversion-loving Mike Rooney (mcrooney).\n\nabayer\n\njglick\n\nkohsuke\n\nmcrooney\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.352 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
