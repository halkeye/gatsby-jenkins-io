Most of these plugins are developed by third party developers or companies and can assist the user in a range of ways. They can extend the core functions, they can offer solutions to repetitive tasks or they can help with using a service. For example, they could help with publishing to an artifact store or spinning up cloud instances. However, before a plugin can use a network based service that requires credentials to connect, those credentials have to be typed in and saved somewhere. This raises the question, are those credentials stored securely? Or not?\nWhen I started looking at different plugins this was one of the first areas I investigated. I found a Jenkins security advisory describing this issue and came to the conclusion that this could be a problem in some plugins, albeit one that could be fixed easily. I found an example of weakly stored credentials in the Publish Over Dropbox Plugin; this plugin used a simple web form with a textbox element to display the token in the plugin’s settings page. This token was stored in plaintext:\n\nThe following Jelly code was behind the web form and shows that a password field wasn’t used:\n\nThe related plugin .xml file contained the secret key in plaintext:\n\nGLOBAL\nwoodspeed\n\nlYD2VnNz\nlYD2VnNz\n\nJenkins offers at least two ways to store credentials in an encrypted format:\n\nUsing a Secret type offered by Jenkins\n\nThird party plugin called Credentials Plugin\n\nThe first case is the easiest solution, because Jenkins will automatically handle the encryption and decryption.\n\nDevelopers should also use the password field tag instead of the textbox field, as shown in the following Jelly control example:\n\nIf you would like to know what other vulnerabilities I discovered and how to fix them, come and join us for the presentation in Lisbon!\nIn case you are unable to attend the conference, you can read more at Story of a Hundred Vulnerable Jenkins Plugins.","title":"Do Plugins Store Credentials In A Secure Way? - DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019","tags":["jenkins world","jenkinsworld","devopsworld2019","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"woodspeed","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Viktor is a security consultant and the 2019 Jenkins Security MVP.</p>\n</div>","id":"woodspeed","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Viktor Gazdag","slug":"/blog/author/woodspeed","twitter":"wucpi"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"63c960fe-cb12-5cdb-8985-10457666b67d","slug":"/blog/2019/10/24/jenkins-performance-avoiding-pitfalls/","strippedHtml":"This is a speaker blogpost for a DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 talk in Lisbon, Portugal\n\nWith Halloween upon us, there’s no better time to discuss Jenkinstein!\nAre you suffering from Jenkins performance issues?\nAre users complaining about a slow UI or even scarier, is Jenkins going down frequently?\n\nCome join me at DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 for \" Jenkins Performance: Avoiding Pitfalls, Diagnosing Issues, and Scaling for Growth \", a talk about JVM administration and best practices from the front lines of supporting thousands of Jenkins installations worldwide.\nDuring this talk we’ll cover how to prevent your Jenkins instance from becoming a Jenkinstein!\n\nTopics we will be discussing:\n\nJVM administration best practices\n\nHorizontal scaling\n\nAnalyzing thread dumps, GC logs, and heap dumps\n\nReal world data showing 3500% performance increases\n\nGarbage collection\n\nWe’ll be discussing how you can forecast for growth, and baseline using key performance indicators like application throughput and latency, by analyzing spooky data like Garbage Collection logs!\n\nCome join me for the presentation in Lisbon!

As a global event, users from all over the world are encouraged to\nsubmit a talk between now and May 1st, 2016 (11:59pm PST).\n\nWe look forward to receiving your amazing submission, and seeing you in Santa\nClara this fall.\n\nSubmit a\nproposal today!","title":"Jenkins World 2016: Call For Papers Is Open!","tags":["jenkins world","event","jenkins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"/blog/author/alyssat","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"jenkins world","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
