We invited a number\nof Jenkins contributors to present brief 10-15 minute demos on something they\nwere working on, or considered themselves experts in. Continuing the\npost-Jenkins World tradition, we also just hosted a \"Jenkins Online Meetup\"\nfeaturing a selection of those lunch-time demos.\n\nI would like to thank Alyssa Tong for organizing this online meetup, Liam Newman for acting as the host, and our speakers:\n\nOleg Nenashev\n\nMichael Hüttermann\n\nThorsten Scherler\n\nStephen Donner\n\nMark Waite\n\nKeith Zantow\n\nBelow are some links from the sample projects demonstrated and the direct links\nto each session.\n\nDeveloping Pipeline Libraries Locally\n\nVideo link\n\nIf you have ever tried developing Pipeline Libraries, you may have noticed how\nlong it takes to deploy a new version to server to discover just another syntax\nerror. I will show how to edit and test Pipeline libraries locally before\ncommitting to the repository (with Configuration-as-Code and Docker).\n\nSlides\n\nSource Code\n\nDemo container\n\nDelivery Pipelines with Jenkins\n\nVideo link\n\nShowing off how to set up holistic Delivery Pipelines with the DevOps enabler tool Jenkins.\n\nDemo application\n\nPimp my Blue Ocean\n\nVideo link\n\nHow to customize Blue Ocean, where I create a custom plugin and extending Blue\nOcean with custom theme and custom components.\n\nPresentation and demo code\n\nDeliver Blue Ocean Components at the Speed of Light\n\nVideo link\n\nUsing storybook.js.org for Blue Ocean frontend to speed up the delivery process\n- validate with PM and designer the UX. Showing how quickly you develop your\ncomponents.\n\nPresentation and demo code\n\nMozilla’s Declarative + Shared Libraries Setup\n\nVideo link\n\nHow Mozilla is using Declarative Pipelines and shared libraries together.\n\nGoogle Doc with links\n\nShared Library source code\n\nDocumentation for the shared library\n\nSee also the #fx-test IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org\n\nGit Tips and Tricks\n\nVideo link\n\nLatest capabilities in the git plugin, like large file support, reference\nrepositories and some reminders of existing tips that can reduce server load,\ndecrease job time, and decrease disc use.\n\nVisual Pipeline Creation in Blue Ocean\n\nVideo link\n\nWe will show how to use Blue Ocean to build a real-world continuous delivery\npipeline using the visual pipeline editor. We will coordinate multiple\ncomponents of a web application across test and production environments,\nsimulating a modern development and deployment workflow.","title":"Pipeline and Blue Ocean Demos from Jenkins World","tags":["jam","jenkinsonlinemeetup","jenkinsworld","events"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"jenkinsonlinemeetup","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
