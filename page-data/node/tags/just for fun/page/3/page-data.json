Jenkins is starting to get to be that age, having been started over 6 years ago.\n\nOne of the most commonly asked questions, is about Jenkins' use of \"blue balls\" to indicate success by default. This is enough of an \"issue\" for some users that the Green Balls plugin is in the list of top 10 installed plugins.\n\nThe reason behind our use of blue to indicate success has its basis in Kohsuke’s Japanese upbringing. The cultural differences were enumerated in a bug report comically titled \"s/blue/green/g\" ( JENKINS-369):\n\nThis response Kohsuke cited was taken from this Q&A thread\n\nQ.\" Why do Japanese people say that they have blue traffic lights when they are really green?\" --Question submitted by John Sypal\n\nA: According to the book, Japan From A to Z: Mysteries of Everyday\nLife Explained by James and Michiko Vardaman, the first traffic\nsignals in Japan were blue instead of green, but the blue lights were difficult to see from a long distance away so they were replaced with green ones. Vardaman says that the custom of referring to traffic lights is a holdover from those days.\n\nThis sounds like a good explanation, but the problem with it is that you will hear Japanese people refer to other green things (like\ncucumbers, spinach, and sometimes grass) as being blue as well. This\nis because historically, Japanese people considered green to be a\nshade of blue. For example, the Chinese character for blue,\npronounced ao is made up of two characters, iki (life) and i (well)\nand refers to the colour of plants which grow around a well, a colour between green and blue. When Chinese people see the character, they say it means green, but Japanese people say it means blue.\n\nJapanese books on colours tell us that there are four tertiary colours: red, blue, white and black, and that all others are shades of those four main ones. Ao, therefore, is a sort of ideal blue, halfway between green and blue. The sky is said to be blue, but it is a different shade of ao than a traffic light is. Tree leaves are said to be green, but green is a shade of ao, like crimson is a shade of red.\n\nIn another interesting cultural difference relating\nto colour, Japanese children always colour the sun red instead of\nyellow.\n\n( here’s a direct link to Kohsuke’s comment )\n\nUnfortunately it’s not for color blind users, although that’s a pretty convincing explanation. Jenkins has blue balls because in Japan, red means stop and blue means go!\n\nImage courtesy of this site","title":"Why does Jenkins have blue balls?","tags":["general","just for fun","jenkinsci"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2011-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","id":"0322997d-f592-516b-a936-503036d0c397","slug":"/blog/2011/10/05/ci-dinner-wednesday-at-630/","strippedHtml":"Apologies for the late notice, I think most of us have been pre-occupied with that fantastic Jenkins User Conference.

Conveniently, they are all events I’ll be attending while traveling around Western Europe!\n\nThe Cologne JUG is having a meetup on Saturday, June 25th, starting at 2pm. We’ll be talking about Jenkins, maybe doing some coding, and then heading out for drinks and more talk! You can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA few days later, TNG Technology Consulting is generously hosting a meetup in Munich, on Wednesday, June 30th, starting at 3pm. I’ll be giving a quick talk on the state of the Jenkins project, followed by Ullrich Haffner (the author of the static analysis plugins for Jenkins) giving a quick talk on how those plugins are used. After that, we’ll be having a hackathon, and then more beer! Again, you can find more information and sign up at Xing.\n\nA week later, the London CI meetup group is hosting a meetup as well, on Wednesday, July 6th, starting at 6:30pm. We’ll be meeting up at the Royal Festival Hall for discussion and drinking. You can find more information and sign up at Meetup.\n\nDo you have a Jenkins event you’d like to have added to our calendar?
