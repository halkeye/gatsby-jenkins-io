Thanks to a huge amuont of help by my future wife, the first shipment of Hudson stickers went into the mail last week. This first shipment was only to United States addresses! If you live outside of the U.S., or if you requested more than 50-ish stickers, I’ve not yet been able to send you stickers. I expect to start sending out international shipments later this week and early next week.\nTo those of you that have received your stickers, I’d like to remind you of the terms of our agreement:\n\nConferences : The only condition being that you tell me all about the event and how Hudson was received after the fact (this may involve an interview).\n\nCompanies : I always appreciate stickers, pens, branded bouncy balls, etc (see: swag) in return!\n\nNice People : If you’re just a fan of Hudson, stickers, or both, I’ll still gladly mail you a few stickers with the condition that you take pictures of where the stickers end up (and maybe of your Hudson install) and either email me some cool pictures or post them to  Flickr (tagged: \"hudsonstickers\")\n\nTo be honest, I really just want to see some pictures of Hudson stickers slapped all over cool stuff: laptops, bosses, servers, desks, stop signs, coworkers, cats, you name it.\n\nIf you did not request stickers, but want some now: please refer to the original post for directions. I do still have stickers left, but there are some \"bulk requests\" I’ve not yet filled. I will do my best to send out as many stickers as I can.","title":"Stickers starting to arrive","tags":["general","just for fun","meta"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Of course, the work never stops on Hudson so we almost have 1.356 ready to roll out the door, but then Kohsuke tweeted this:\n\nBecause of the data center migration going on, I won’t be able to release #hudsonci today.\n\nI won’t go into details on some of the infrastructure changes we have lined up just yet, so here’s the breakdown of 1.355\n\nBugs fixed\n\nColored ball image at top of build pages was broken for Hudson in some web containers (fixed by removing workaround for a Firefox bug fixed since 3.0.5/Dec2008). ( issue 2341)\n\nConsole page while build is running did not wrap lines when viewed in IE. ( issue 5869)\n\nFixed build history to indicate test failure for MavenBuild and MavenModuleSetBuild.\n\nMake dropdownList work in repeatable content, such as a build step.\n\nEnhancements\n\nAdded the agent retention strategy based on a schedule.\n\nAdded to configure charset option of Mailer.\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.355 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links","releases"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Behold, the first release of Hudson ever made by a not-employed-by-Sun Kohsuke (as we covered last week). This iteration of Hudson contains only bug fixes, check the listing below for the specifics on which bugs have been fixed (1.355 is looking like it will contain a number of fixes as well). The release of 1.354 comes slightly later than usual given some of the logistics that needed to, or still need to be resolved.\n\nOne of the infrastructure issues that’s half-way resolved is the question of Debian/Ubuntu packages. Kohuske has packages uploaded in an experimental apt repository on hudson-labs.org which you can try out. That said, it’s not entirely clear whether this is going to be the preferred means of distributing native Debian/Ubuntu packages in the future (your mileage may vary).\n\nBugs fixed\n\nPOM parsing was still using the module root as the base for relative paths for alternate settings files. ( issue 6080)\n\nFix dynamic updates of build history table when CSRF protection is turned on. ( issue 6072)\n\nImproved the error reporting mechanism in LDAP setting.\n\nRaw console output contains garbage. ( issue 6034)\n\nFixed a file handle leak in the agents connection. ( issue 6137)\n\nQuiet period wasn’t taking effect properly when doing parameterized builds.\n\nContributors\n\nThe release of 1.354 contains a total of 51 commits to the \"core\" part of the tree, from 9 different contributors\n\nabayer\n\ndrulli\n\nkohsuke\n\nmanuel_carrasco\n\nmindless\n\nsogabe\n\nswiest\n\nvlatombe\n\nwyukawa\n+\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from hudson-ci.org or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Hudson 1.354 Released","tags":["development","feedback","just for fun","links","releases"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

I say that he is leaving Sun, instead of leaving Oracle as Kohsuke worked at Sun for nine years and Oracle only a few months. In those nine years at Sun, Kohsuke has worked on some great products, the most notable of them being Hudson.\n\nPer Kohsuke’s post:\n\nWhere am I heading next? I’m actually starting my own company to take Hudson to the next stage.\n\nWhat this means for Hudson still isn’t certain yet, fortunately it means that Hudson will continue to have at least one full-time developer. It remains to be seen where KohsukeCorp (the name has not yet been disclosed) will focus within the Hudson code-base. For the greater user-base of Hudson, this means that the schedule for releases may slow down during this transitional period, there are some logistics to work out with Oracle regarding some of the hardware Hudson has traditionally used to host JIRA, this blog, and a number of other machines helping support the Hudson project in one fashion or another.\n\nThe next couple of months will be interesting for the Hudson community; as per usual you’ll be able to get the latest updates from this blog or the @hudsonci twitter account. I’ll let Kohsuke finish this post off:\n\nAnd finally, big thank you to everyone in the Hudson community, and in a broader java.net community. I wouldn’t be here without you guys, and I feel very proud that I’m a part of it.","title":"Kohsuke leaves Sun","tags":["core","feedback","just for fun"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

In an effort to address these concerns, the Hudson core team has https://web.archive.org/web/ /https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/just-kidding.jpg[announced] a roadmap for Hudson 2.0.\n\nIn a message to the dev@ mailing list, Kohsuke said of Hudson 2.0:\n\nAs it stands now Hudson 1.0 is a good proof of concept, it’s time to take the lessons learned and build a truly solid enterprise-ready continuous integration server\nSome notable points from Kohsuke’s announcement with regards to the Hudson 2.0 roadmap, which is expected to ship late Q4 2011, are:\n\nImplementation of core in portable C for greater speed and code readability\n\nSelection of a better license, namely the WTFPL\n\nRevamped storage architecture around the Oracle 11g Database to provide more optimal synergy over flat XML files.\n\nEmbedding the Mono, Python, V8 and Lua engines allowing plugins to be written in C#, Python, JavaScript or Lua.\n\nAdoption of the Hudson Eagle as a mascot instead of the butler\n\n\"Social\" support will be merged into core, integrating Hudson directly with Facebook so you can share test failures with your friends.\n\nHudson 2.0 is expected to follow in the intrepid footsteps of other major revamps such as Netscape 5 and Perl 6 in its ambitiousness and innovation.","title":"Announcing the Hudson 2.0 Roadmap","tags":["just for fun","meta"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
