For many software developers the Thanksgiving holiday also represents a lull in project schedules, freeing up some time to hack on pet projects or even contribute to open source projects.\n\nTaking a cue from the Adopt a Plugin program that Daniel wrote about earlier this month, we thought it would be fun to organize a \"virtual hackathon\" to coincide with that gap in project schedules. Thus Hacksgiving 2015 was created!\n\nWe’ll be hosting Hacksgiving Nov 23rd and Nov 24 from 7:00PST - 15:00PST (10:00EST - 18:00EST) and would love for you to join! ( RSVP here)\n\nYou don’t need to know Java to help! We will have documentation and design hacking going on as well.\n\nWe have a few goals for Hacksgiving:\n\nIntroduce new contributors to the process of writing code and/or documentation ( documentation hacking details here).\n\nFind some plugins which are up for adoption new maintainers.\n\nClean up or merge some existing plugins which need some care ( listed here).\n\n=== Sessions to note\n\nHere are some of the sessions scheduled that will be hosted by members of community that may interest you:\n\nDay One\n\n7:00PST/10:00EST ( 15-30min) - rtyler will host a welcome and introduction to contribution to the Jenkins project (walking through our contributors guide)\n\n10:00PST/13:00EST ( 60min) - schristou will host a workshop titled \"Introduction to plugin development for Jenkins\"\n\nDay Two\n\n10:00PST/13:00EST ( 60min) - abayer will be hosting a \"Plugin Developer Open Q&A\" session, so bring your questions!\n\nHacksgiving is very unconference structured right now, so if you’re interested in hosting a session please let us know in the #jenkins-community channel or by signing up for a session on the schedule\n\nHow to participate\n\nSince this is a virtual hackathon, we’ll be congregating and chatting in a couple of ways:\n\nOn the #jenkins IRC channel as per usual\n\nWe’ll be hosting sessions and tutorials via Google Hangouts, see the \" hacker hangout * section on the wiki page up to date details\n\nVia the #hacksgiving hashtag on Twitter\n\nYou can also RSVP on our meetup page!\n\nWe hope you can join in the festivities!","title":"Celebrating Hacksgiving!","tags":["general","cia","just for fun"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

The introduction of Java 8 last year brought performance improvements and highly desirable API changes, which make developing Java-based applications (arguably) much easier than before. The release was followed earlier this year by the end-of-life announcement for Java 7; the writing is on the wall: upgrade to Java 8.\n\nI wanted to answer the question \"does it even make sense to force an upgrade to Java 8?\" There are plenty of technical discussions that we can have in the community on whether or not this is the right approach, but my goal was to try and measure the current Jenkins install base for Java 8 preparedness.\n\nWhile we do not currently (to my knowledge) collect Java runtime versions in our anonymous usage statistics, we do have access logs from our mirror redirector which might provide some insight.\n\nWith some access logs data, I went through the millions of requests made to Jenkins infrastructure in 2015 and started filtering out the user agent which made those requests.\n\nNOTE: This data is totally not scientific and is only meant to provide a coarse insight into what versions of Java access Jenkins web infrastructure.\n\nWhen Jenkins hits the mirror network, it’s not overriding the default user agent from the Java runtime, so many of the user agents for the HTTP request are something like Java/1.7.0_75. This indicates that the request came from a Java Runtime version 1.7.0 (update 75).\n\nLooking at the major JVM versions making (non-unique) requests to Jenkins infrastructure we have:\n\n1.8.0 : 21,278,960\n\n1.7.0 : 27,340,214\n\n1.6.0 : 4,148,833\n\nThis breaks down across various updates as well, which is also particularly interesting to me because many of these Java versions have long since had security advisories posted against them. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/jvm-versions-with-updates.png\n\nAs I mentioned before, this is not a rigorous analysis of the access log data and is also not filtered by unique IP addresses. What I found most interesting though is that the Java 8 upgrade numbers are actually fairly strong, which I didn’t expect. I expect that piece of the pie will continue to grow. Hopefully so much so that we’re able to move over to Java 8 before the end of 2016!","title":"What JVM versions are running Jenkins?","tags":["general","just for fun"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

If you are a long-time user, you might even view the configuration page with that same reassuring nostalgia seeing a Facebook post from your ugly room mate induces. ‘Yup,he is still ugly and backwards, but we had some good times, back then.’ If you are a newer Jenkins user, it may well send you off to search the web for a viable alternative tool. +\n\n+\nThe good news is that CloudBees, in cooperation with the greater Jenkins community, is looking to make some long overdue progress sorting through this user interaction in a way that is both approachable to new users and amenable to existing users who have grown comfortable with a great tool and a ‘stalwart friend’ in a world of otherwise clunky world of IT tools. ( that really is the swiss army knife of build automation.) +\n\n+\n\nIf you happen to have had the opportunity to have attended any of the recent Jenkins User Conferences in Washington, DC, or London, you may have seen Tom and my presentation, which served as our initial introduction of this effort to the Jenkins Community. In this article and the associated video, I will be focusing specifically on the Create and Configuration screens in Jenkins, discussing some of the larger proposed changes, providing some context for the changes and examining their possible repercussions on existing plugins and future plugin development.\n\n+\n+\n\nHistory of Jenkins\n\n+\n\n+\nFor newer Jenkins users, I have found the following visual a helpful guide to understanding the history of Jenkins and how its graphical user interfaces has evolved:\n\n+\n +\nimage:/sites/default/files/images/history-jenkins_590.jpg[Jenkins timeline: a long history] +\n\n+\nThe first thing to notice here, is that Jenkins has been around for a long time and in a lot of ways is really fundamental to the art of creating software. Back in 2005, the then Hudson project was using pretty much the same cave chalk as everyone else. 6 years later, the code and community underwent its most substantial transformation to date, as Jenkins emerged as the dominant fork of the Hudson project. If you look closely, you will see the GUI reflected that transformation by….. changing the picture of the butler. In recent times, the interface has taken a few additional steps forward, most notably by moving to a responsive CSS driven layout from its table based origin, but the pace of these changes has been very much akin to the pace of evolution. Slow. +\n\n+\nIn our next phase of graphic interface development, however, Tom and I are looking to be a little more directed in our efforts and push the GUI toward a blend of strategic and tactical advancements that will help Jenkins take advantage of some of the advances in web design and browser technologies that have happened over the last 10 years. Our first major push will be in the job creation and configuration tasks. +\n\n+\n\nCreating and Configuring\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nIn addition to a bit of a refresh of the look of these forms, this new effort focuses on the importance of dividing information and presentation into clear categories that ideally are meaningful to both new and veteran users of Jenkins alike.\n\n+\n+\n\nIn some cases, Jenkins has these categories already in the GUI, but misses the mark in clarification and emphasis. In other cases, additional categorizing concepts will need to be added. Compare the above screens to the existing screens.\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\nThe first thing you are likely to notice when comparing these two sets of screens is that in the existing screens, there is very little in the way of visual markers segmenting the form input choices on either the item type selection screens (fig 4 vs 2) or the configuration pages (fig 5 vs 3). Adding each new plugin progressively aggravates the situation, and consequently, as your Jenkins installation grows in sophistication and robustness, the average users ability to find the fundamental configuration settings in the sea of ad-hoc options diminishes. While adding functionality typically adds some amount of additional complexity to a UI, by giving each configuration option a visually distinguishable space in the form, the challenge can be greatly diminished and the pattern of creating an ever growing scrolling of toilet paper list of form elements can be avoided.\n\n+\n\nFor figures 2 and 4, you might also notice that I have chosen Jenkins instances that already have several plugins installed as the basis for my example screens. You might rightly argue that for a basic install, there are not a lot of item types to create, so categorizing them adds a needless layer of complexity. Fair enough. It is my belief, though, that our software can be smart enough to count the item types available for creation and count the number within each category and handle the categorization as necessary. Counting and sorting is something that computers do incredibly well and is not the sort of thing busy people need to be overly burdened with.\n\n+\n\nIn addition to the code being intelligent about when to present grouping categories to the user, The screen interaction can be similarly intelligent in how it enables the user to selectively show and hide the categories of interest. The following screenshot shows the configuration page focused in on CVS a particular option configuration in the source code management section of the configuration page. It, in turn, has its own sub settings for additional modules and locations (see fig 6).\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\n…​and wait for it…​ …​for comparison, here is today’s CVS settings page…​\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\nDespite some serious indentation, the existing page offers significantly less clarity about which settings pertain specifically to CVS instead of other aspects of a Jenkins job.\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\nIdentifying which settings go with which segment becomes all the more confusing when sub-sections can be re-ordered. To show you what I mean and fit the screen on a single printed page, I am needing to muck with the aspect ratio of today’s screen.\n\n+\n\nThe image on the left (fig 7) shows a 2 step build process, each with sub parameters.\n\n+\n\nThere are some fascinating looking red delete buttons in here, I hope I know exactly what part of the build step I am about to blow away…​. Did I mention these segments can be re-ordered? Care to guess which form inputs will move with which steps?\n\n+\n\n[image]\n\n+\n\nBy contrast, the above screen shows the same 2 build steps with the same parameters. We still have our friend, Mr. Red Delete button, but now it is a good bit clearer who will get blown away.\nAlso, it is considerably clearer which block will be reordered, should I choose to do so.\n\n+\n\nWhat about plugins?\n\n+\n\nIf you are a long-time Jenkins user, you may have a guess as to why some of these changes have been slow in coming, and if you are a plugin developer, you definitely know. These input controls have a lot of extension points in them that allow plugins to influence the content of this configuration screen. As a result, how plugins will respond to even the most minor layout changes is somewhat of a mystery. Further, the GUI control elements that make up the form are available to plugin authors to embed as they see fit in their own GUI elements. As a consequence, we have some serious compatibility issues ahead. These challenges are not at all trivial.\n\n+\n\nFortunately, however, I believe with some careful manipulation and diligent testing we can overcome these challenges. The first set of changes are likely to revolve around a file called “hudson-behavior.js”. This file does most of the Jenkins client-side UI magic. If there is data to be bound to a control, this is the file that is likely to handle it. The difficulty with this file stems from two factors, its age (it is written following Yahoo UI framework patterns which have since been abandoned by Yahoo and the rest of the industry), and a presumption that the page layout will be governed by a single giant HTML table (likely due to the table renaissance happening around the same time, thanks to the emergence of GWT). Regardless of this bit of history trivia, these two issues combine to make changes to the HTML DOM structure of any Jenkins page problematic. Methods such as “findFollowingTR” assume a very rigid parent-child element positioning based on page layout rather than on the logical relationship between the data elements. The good news here is that despite some of their unfortunate names, can be refactored to both find the relevant element based on today’s table structure as well as a future logical nesting of related elements. With that change in place, Jenkins will continue to function as it always has and a future configuration DOM structure can share the same infrastructure.\n\n+\n\n+\nThe second step here will be finding efficient ways to integrate more modern Javascript libraries, such as JQuery and Bootstrap into the Jenkins GUI. We will want these libraries to be easier and cleaner for plugin authors to access than PrototypeJS and Yahoo UI are today. Likely this will involve using a Browserify/Requirejs like pattern to control script inclusion in page to avoid naming conflicts, excessively file attachment and global space pollution.\n\n+\n\nThe final step would then be to begin amending, replacing and augmenting the Jelly based form control set, and thus, transforming the look and behavior of the Jenkins UI. As always, Jenkins is an open community, and we at CloudBees view that as a cherished cornerstone of our own corporate culture. Thus, at every phase of this undertaking we are eager to solicit feedback from and encourage participation by you the members of the community. Feel free to comment directly on this article. Additionally, I am maintaining and active thread on the Jenkins Developer group ( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/6BdWZt35dTQ). I am looking forward to hearing from you.","title":"Advancing the Jenkins GUI: Configuring Items in Jenkins","tags":["video","screencast","juc","core","releases","feedback","development","just for fun","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"gusreiber","html":"","id":"gusreiber","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Gus Reiber","slug":"/blog/authors/gusreiber","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2015-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","id":"1c1ae65c-aeae-5855-bc4e-cc4d328eb58f","slug":"/blog/2015/02/25/100k-celebration-podcast/","strippedHtml":"+\nAs a part of https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-celebration-day-february-26[the Jenkins 100K celebration], Dean Yu, Andrew Bayer, R.

YOU are one of the 100K active users!\n\nAs discussed on a couple recent project meetings, we have designated February 26 as Jenkins Celebration Day.\nTo make some noise, here is what we are doing starting NOW:\n\nWrite a blog about anything related to Jenkins. Post your blog and Tweet out a link to it. Include the hashtag #Jenkins100K in your post.\n\nOn February 26, we will hold a raffle and pick four names at random. The grand prize winner will get a 3D Jenkins Butler model. Five others will get their pick of Jenkins swag (up to $20) from the Jenkins online store.\n\nOTHER WAYS TO CELEBRATE\n\nThere are a number of other things planned and we want YOU to be involved. This blog post is the central place to come for all things related to the celebration.\n\nRecording – Jenkins Governance Board\nDean, Tyler, Andrew and I will get together this month and record some thoughts about the Jenkins project. We will share that recording with you from this page on February 26.\n\nTwitter Badge\nFor those of us on social media that want to proudly celebrate our community, we will have a special badge that you can use for your profile image on Twitter or any of the other social media forums. Feel free to use the badge as long as you want – but let’s get as many of us using it as possible between now and February 27.\n\nSocial Media Images\n\nCloudBees is donating a series of images that we can all push out on social media (whatever platform(s) you use).\n\nPick your favorite(s) and push them out on Twitter, Facebook, G+\n\nCertificate (available on this blog post soon)\nDownload your very own “I am part of the Jenkins 100K” certificate. Print it out and proudly display it on the wall of your cube or office.\n\nVisibility\nThe Community will also issue a press release on February 26 announcing our milestone news.\n\nSign the “card”\nConsider this blog a Congratulations card to the entire community. Share your thoughts in a comment on this blog about anything Jenkins-related that you wish!\n\nThis is a big milestone for the Community and one you should be proud to be part of!
