Who is it for? What are the highlights of your plugin?* +\n +\n\n+\nA: https://loader.io[Loader.io] is a simple-to-use cloud-based load testing service. The service is designed for developers and people who need to ensure applications are performing as they should. It allows developers to perform large-scale load tests on demand, which lets them understand the scalability and performance of their applications. We realize Jenkins is the preferred build service for a lot of our users, and we know providing a way for them to implement, measure and improve application performance during the continuous build cycle is important. So we wrote a Jenkins plugin that allows load testing to be brought into the continuous build and deployment process with ease. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: Did you have to convince your boss/lawyers to open-source your plugin? What was the pitch?*\n\n+\nA: No, at SendGrid our focus is always to help make developers’ lives easier, and when we can, we like to provide tools that they can hack on. Since the Jenkins platform is itself an open source project, following the same model to provide our plugin made perfect sense. In addition, we encourage others to build on our work, help improve it and ultimately make it better for everyone using it. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: How did you learn how to write a plugin?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: We use the Jenkins platform ourselves, and we leverage a number of the plugins available. Having access to these and the Jenkins documentation gave us a great head start. It was an easy decision to write the Jenkins plugin for loader.io, and the Jenkins community provided both detailed instructions as well as support when we needed it. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: Any gotchas in the experience of developing a plugin that you want to share?\n\n*\n\n+\nA: The overall process of developing the plugin was straightforward and simple, but we did run into some scope creep in the middle of the dev process. We found that since the platform was so easy to write for, it made us keep adding more and more features. Usually this is good, but in the case of our project, we wanted to provide the most value as quickly as possible. So we scaled back, focused on solid execution for the most important features, and are already preparing to launch a new version with the things we reserved for post v1 availability. +\n +\n +\n\n+\nQ: What is the reaction from users so far?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: The users we’ve spoken with love the plugin. In addition we’ve already gotten great feedback from some community members on “nice to have’s” in the plugin, some of which we’re already working on. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: What tips do you share to those who are interested in writing plugins?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: If you have a service that provides value in the build, deployment and post deployment process, then you should be writing a Jenkins plugin. Two things are important for anyone writing a plugin: 1) be sure the plugin you’re writing is going to provide true value (if you need it yourself this is a good sign), and 2) make sure you understand the scope of the project and deliver core features and value first, then focus on some extra things. Providing a valuable plugin sooner than later will help you identify all the right additional features to include, especially when collecting live community feedback. +\n +\n\n+\nSome of the things we focused on early in the process were to identify the core features, and more importantly to make it very easy for users of Jenkins to install, use and interpret the loader.io plugin and results. We wanted to allow users to leverage our plugin for multiple environments and builds with system and global credentials. To do this, we decided to make use of the Credentials plugin (https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin), which is a heavily-adopted plugin that provides a standardized API for plugins to store and retrieve credentials. This plugin allows our users to add and use different credentials in one single Jenkins environment. In addition, we created a new re-run feature which, when used with continuous build and testing, provides a deep view into the performance of an application over time. Finally, we wanted to bring the same UI experience users have in our environment into Jenkins, which we did by preserving the load test report model and making it function the same in the Jenkins UI. Doing this makes it easy for users to have consistency between the UIs and more easily understand the results regardless of where they’re viewing them. +\n +\n\n+\nIt’s very easy to write a Jenkins plugin - I hope these insights will encourage you to write your own. +\n +\n\n+\nps - We’d love your feedback too.

The SIGAR API implements a portable interface in C for gathering system information related to memory, processors, file systems, network interfaces, network connection tables, the process table and more.  We support dozens of OS + version + architecture combinations, along with several language bindings.  SIGAR is a key component of the Hyperic HQ agent and is used in other projects including Hypertable, Terracotta, GridGain and MySQL enterprise.\n\nHudson Was SpringSource using continuous integration before Hudson? If so, what caused you guys to switch?\n\nDoug The SIGAR project actually started back in late 2002 and our initial CI system for the project was a good old-fashioned Perl script / ssh for-loop.  It was good enough to get by in the early years, but a proper replacement was long overdue.  We were (and still are) using Bamboo to build and test Hyperic HQ.  We looked at using Bamboo for SIGAR, but at the time the \"Remote Agent\" feature was new to Bamboo and was not in the version we were running. Rather than disrupt HQ’s CI along with taking on an additional licensing cost, we gave Hudson a shot and haven’t looked back.\n\nHudson Might be a bit of personal bias, but I think you guys made the right choice there! Checking out the public Hudson server, I see that SpringSource is building/testing products on AIX, the BSDs, various flavors of Linux, Solaris, Windows and Mac OS X, what kinds of languages/build systems are being built by Hudson? How varied are the environments that Hudson executes jobs in?\n\nDoug And HP-UX! The matrix of SIGAR’s supported OS + kernel version + architecture + distribution is north of 100 combinations.  So, Hudson is covering a very heterogeneous collection of systems with most jobs tied to a specific node.  Our primary focus has been the C API and Java JNI bindings, using an Ant based build system and a JUnit test suite.  SIGAR also has language bindings for Perl, Ruby, Python, Erlang, PHP, C# and Lua.  So, Hudson is also driving each language’s extension build system of choice, respectively: MakeMaker, Rake, distutils, emake, phpize, Nant and autotools.\n\nHudson What do you consider to be noteworthy about your Hudson implementation? Besides, clearly, that you’re running Hudson agents on just about every OS that will run Java :)\n\nDoug The majority of our x86/x64 nodes are virtualized on VMware ESX and VMware Server.  We also have a fine collection of PPC, PA-RISC and Sparc hardware in house, with IA-64 and s390x hosted elsewhere by third parties.  Some of these systems are too old to support Java 1.5 and/or Git.  As a simple work-around, the nodes share an NFS workspace where the agent node takes care of 'SCM' and 'Post-build Actions', but the 'Build' step in between is invoked via ssh. The SIGAR distribution includes about two dozen native binaries that are compatible with most of the supported platform matrix.  There’s a Hudson job for each Git branch that rolls these binaries into a release bundle. Another job flavor uses the Hudson URL SCM plugin to download and unit test the binary releases on the rest of the platform matrix.  This is key to testing binary compatibility.  Similar for the collectd project, each Git branch has a job that runs automake, autoconf, etc. and 'make dist' into the collectd release flavor tarball.  So a push to git.verplant.org by octo in Germany triggers an update of the collectd release artifact, which in turn triggers the URL SCM jobs to download the tarball, unpack and build over here at our west coast locations. We have four Hudson servers in different locations, three of which are managing most of the jobs behind firewalls.  Select jobs use the Build Publisher plugin to post the job and its artifacts to our public Hudson server. This makes it easy for us to provide platform specific bug fixes in binary form, share build logs with external projects and host a central repository of artifacts reachable by all of the URL SCM based jobs. Our public Hudson server also provides CI for the HQApi project and jobs to build HQ plugins, again making it easier to distribute patch fixes in binary form between releases.\n\nHudson I’ve very impressed! I’m glad the fact that Java won’t run on some of the platforms you want to support hasn’t stopped you from testing anyways. Clearly you folks have written some addition tools behind the scenes, mind discussing them a bit?\n\nDoug Other than some Hudson plugin tweaks and additions, the Perl script I mentioned earlier was converted to generate the majority of our Hudson jobs and includes a simple templating system.  The same script generates jobs to build collectd and a few other projects.  We’ve outgrown this flavor of the script and have started working on integrating Opscode Chef to automate our Hudson configration along with the systems we build and test on. And of course, we’re using Hyperic HQ to monitor our Hudson server instances, agent and node machines.\n\nHudson But of course, I’d say dog-fooding is an important part of any continuous testing set up. It appears that SpringSource has bought in pretty deeply to a Hudson-oriented workflow, given the amount of time and resources you all have invested in getting the massive farm set up that you have. That said, on a scale from 1-10, how important would you rate Hudson to your day-to-day workflow?\n\nDoug I’d say at least an 8, although my daily workflow doesn’t always directly involve Hudson.  Most of those points go to Hudson for automating what otherwise would be interrupting my workflow on a daily basis.\n\nI'd like to thank Doug again for giving us a peek behind the curtains at SpringSource and how they're using Hudson.

This project turned into Hyperic HQ which shifted his focus to systems and application management for the past ~7 years and counting.
