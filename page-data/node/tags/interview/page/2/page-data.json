This being our second \"spotlight\" on a particular company, the format can still be considered beta; if you have any additional questions for Rasheed, feel free to ask them in the comments and I’ll try to get Rasheed to answer.\n\nSimilar to the spotlight on ITA Software from last week, VisFleet builds business software helping their customers operate their businesses more effectively through web applications in tandem with mobile applications. While I could endlessly discuss the power and flexibility of Hudson, particularly for building web software, I’ll let Rasheed do the majority of the talking, so let’s get to it.\nintroducing VisFleet, would you mind explaining a bit more of what you guys do and some of the challenges it presents?\n\nRasheed It’s a pleasure. VisFleet has changed it’s direction somewhat, moving from\nservices into product development. As we move into product, we want to be\nresponsive to our customers. Agile development is becoming core to how we\noperate, and as such, continuous builds and integration became a major\nfactor. We now plan to offer two products for work planning and and vehicle\ntracking. We want to present these systems with a SaaS model. The world of\nonline, pay as you go software, has a culture of frequent improvements and\nresponsiveness to user feedback. If we want to do well in this space, it’s\nimportant that we can code, test, release and feed back in\ntight iterations.\n\nHudson How long has VisFleet been using Hudson?\n\nRasheed About 14 months now.\n\nHudson Did you guys work with continuous integration prior to starting to use\nHudson? If so, what system was VisFleet using and what compelled the switch\nto\nHudson?\n\nRasheed We didn’t actually, but certainly everyone I knew who was doing continuous\nintegration recommended Hudson.\n\nHudson That’s good to hear! How lucky you are to know so many smart people :)\nWhat kinds of projects is VisFleet building with Hudson?\n\nRasheed We build and test Ruby On Rails service layer applications. We also build Flex applications using the Flex SDK for our web-deployed RIA offering. Lastly, we build our iPhone applications using Hudson.\n\nHudson I’d say building and testing web applications alone with Hudson would be quite notable, but to add Flex and iPhone applications into the mix as well is certainly interesting! Anything specific that’s interesting about VisFleet’s use of Hudson?\n\nRasheed It runs multiple agent types, and automates deploys to different cloud\ninfrastructures. At the moment we have 2 Flex build agents running Ubuntu, A\nMac Mini building our iPhone app, and several Ubuntu Servers testing our web\ntier. We currently deploy to Citrix Xen servers, and soon to Rackspace Cloud as well.\n\nIn the near future, we will automate integration by first updating an\nintegration system on the cloud, deploying our system and then running our\ntests. All very quickly.\n\nWe have very little metric and reporting output from Hudson, and this is\nnoteworthy in it’s absence. It’s very important  to use to provide clear\ndevelopment metrics and integrate those into our Scrum / Kanban approach. What\nHudson has done for us is educate us about the possibilities in\nvisualisation and reporting, and is informing the way we structure our\ncodebase going forward. Soon, we expect to have a premium test driven\ndevelopment environment and workflow.\n\nHudson We all know Hudson isn’t perfect but there’s a lot of room for extending it to meet your demands if need be, what additional tools have you written to glue everything together behind\nthe scenes?\n\nRasheed We are using ' Vlad the Deployer ' and in legacy, ' Capistrano ' for a lot of\nour deployment and build tasks. These are merely infrastructure specific\nscripts to ensure we can bring up live environments in the shortest amount\nof time possible.\n\nHudson So it sounds like you guys are all on board with Hudson, on a 1-10 scale, how important would you rate Hudson’s importance to VisFleet’s workflow?\n\nRasheed 7, aiming at 10. The missing points are just a matter of time :)\n\nThanks again to Rasheed for chatting with me about how Hudson helps VisFleet keep cranking on what they do best.

When I sent out a message asking for users of Hudson in the corporate space to ping me about doing a \"spotlight\" on them, ITA Software stuck out in particular; they’re hiring a Hudson expert!\n\nThe format for the \"spotlight\" series isn’t entirely nailed down yet so feel free to ask questions in the comments section and I’ll follow-up with Matt after the fact if need be. That said, without further delay, Matt Girard from ITA Software, on Hudson.\n--- Hudson Matt, appreciate you taking the time to answer some questions about Hudson at ITA Software, let’s start with a simple one: How long has ITA been using Hudson?\n\nMatt My pleasure, glad to be a part of the community. We have been using Hudson in some form since early 2008. Predictably our usage has increased over time and now encompasses the majority of our automated build and test infrastructure.\n\nHudson Was continuous integration a part of ITA’s workflow prior to adopting Hudson? If so: what did ITA switch to Hudson from, and why?\n\nMatt Yes, though not to the degree that we have now. Prior to Hudson we were reliant on BuildBot for our automated builds, but we were not doing continuous integration\n across our components until after the transition to Hudson. The easy to understand UI and flexibility were primary features that compelled our switch. I should mention\n that when we decided to switch we also evaluated CruiseControl but Hudson came out on top for our needs.\n\nHudson What kind of projects are you typically using Hudson for? What\nlanguages/build system(s)? What platforms is Hudson performing builds? What kinds of jobs primarily run on ITA’s Hudson cluster?\n\nMatt Our Hudson environments (yes, we have more than one) have been optimized for building C++, Java (all maven based), Lisp (a surprise to some to be sure more about that here), and Python on Linux build agents (Fedora and CentOS).\n\nOur jobs are (loosely) grouped into one of three categories: rpm (we are primarily RedHat based), tests, and tools. The rpm jobs are the actual code builds and individual component unit tests. The test jobs (thank you parameterized trigger plugin!) are part of a larger cross-component integration testing and promotion scheme. The (handful of) tools jobs support us in tasks such as cleaning up stale sandbox database connections.\n\nHudson Given the flexibility of Hudson, it’s safe to say that not everybody is using it in the exact same fashion, is there anything you would consider interesting or noteworthy about the use of Hudson at ITA?\n\nMatt I think that our most interesting usage of Hudson has to be how we have combined parameterized builds with the parameterized trigger plugin in order to do cross-component testing of trunk code. More specifically, we pass a properties file (to us a \"scoreboard\" that tells the jobs what exact revisions of which projects to\n test together) to several jobs and only build a final promotion job if ALL of downstream jobs (with the same scoreboard) passed. In this way we create a hurdle that all of our code must clear before we even consider deploying it anywhere else.\n\nThe next most interesting thing we are doing is using Hudson for continuous deployment of monitoring changes into our staging environment. It’s quite rewarding to watch a check-in makes it’s way through Hudson, into and rpm, and out to a server without a human being involved.\n\nHudson Are there any additional tools ITA has written to better integrate things \"behind the scenes\"?\n\nMatt We evolved what became a very large build script (mostly derived from what we had for BuildBot) that handles all of the nitty-gritty details involved in the building, packaging, and testing of our software. Recently we have been working to refactor this into several smaller build tools each with a more focused purpose. The first of these is designed (largely as a wrapper to rpmbuild) to standardize our package building while leaving the .spec files (with the real specifics) living alongside the code where they belong.\n\nHudson On a scale from 1-10, how important would you rate Hudson for ITA’s\nday-to-day workflow?\n\nMatt ITA is a decent size company and there is plenty of work that goes on that does not involve Hudson in any way. Still since we rely on the building and testing that Hudson does in order to promote new code to production, I would say that we are somewhere around an 8.\n\nI’d like to thank Matt again for being a good sport as the very first in what I hope will be a long line of \"spotlights\" on companies using Hudson to help them work smart, better and faster.
