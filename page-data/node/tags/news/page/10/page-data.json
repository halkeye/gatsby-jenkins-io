A security advisory released yesterday by InfraDNA goes on to explain the hole with more detail:\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files in the\nserver file system whose path names are known, by sending malicious\nHTTP GET requests. While such access is still subject to the normal\naccess control enforced by the operating system, Hudson can still leak\n\"secrets\" possessed by Hudson\n\nThe vulnerability inside of Hudson affects Hudson instances running inside the embedded Winstone container, instances behind Glasshfish or Jetty (for example) are not subject to this vulnerability. Instances running behind a reverse proxy such as mod_proxy or Nginx.\n\nHudson system administrators should subscribe to either the security advisories RSS feed or the advisories@ mailing list\n\nYou can go grab the latest .war file straight from our OSL mirror or if you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.","title":"Security Fix!

It’s been a long time since I’ve written for the Hudson community, but now I’m back and ready to tackle some of the latest developments in the Hudson community.\n\nWhat is Hudson Labs?\n\nAs you may have read in April, Kohsuke left Oracle to found InfraDNA, a company specializing around Hudson. The departure meant the Hudson community would no longer have access to some of the hardware and services that Kohsuke had accumulated over the years working on Hudson at Sun Microsystems. While we are still happily part of the Java.net community, we’ve recognized the need for some community-owned resources and Hudson Labs was born.\n\nOver the past couple months, a group within the Hudson community, \"infra\" (short for \"infrastructure\"), has been working to get machines set up and build the foundation for a more open Hudson project infrastructure.\n\nWhat does Hudson Labs provide?\nBuilds\n\nOne of the first tasks we set upon when building out Hudson Labs was to start improving the build and release process of Hudson by moving as much of it into a public Hudson instance. Building Hudson itself, plugins and dependencies of the Hudson project, the Hudson Labs instance will help improve the reliability of the Hudson ecosystem across the board, and should serve as a useful tool for core and plugin developers.\n\nMirroring\n\nThanks to the great team over at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab ( OSUOSL), we’ve been able to build out mirroring infrastructure for Hudson to provide fast access to native packages and wars alike. Currently the OSUOSL only has mirrors inside the continental United States, so we’re reaching out to friends in Asia and Europe to extend the mirroring system.\n\nInformation\n\nI’m currently working on re-working some of the blog posts you may have read over four months as more structured tutorials. I hope to provide an easily accessible knowledge-base for developing Hudson along with configuring Hudson for various platforms and development environments; this is a more difficult task so all the pieces aren’t entirely in place for this just yet.\n\nTo be honest, I’m very enthusiastic about Hudson’s future. Now that InfraDNA is up and running, Kohsuke’s renewed focus combined with the foundation of Hudson Labs and the uncommonly hospitable Hudson developer and user communities, the future is looking bright!","title":"Welcome to Hudson Labs!","tags":["general","meta","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

I use Hudson to build and test a number of pure Python modules and C extensions across numerous Python versions (covering 2.4 - 3.1). For most beginners, or those simply looking to get started with Python on Hudson, starting with my job configurations is too much at once, so instead I wanted to start at the \"beginning\" so to speak.\n\nThe trouble with getting people started with Hudson, given how simple and visual it is to use, is that articles with sample configurations are not particularly useful; a screencast however is a good medium for visually walking somebody through Hudson. The screencast below ( also on YouTube) is the first in a series of screencasts I’ll be doing, not only for Python on Hudson, but for Hudson overall.
