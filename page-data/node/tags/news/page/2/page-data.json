The goal is to make Confluence upgrade more manageable and testable. In the proces, I've not only containerized Confluence, but also containerized https://github.com/jenkins-infra/confluence-cache[some other services], including https://github.com/jenkins-infra/mock-ldap[mock LDAP server], to be able to test the copy of the production Confluence dataset against newer versions of Confluence before upgrading production. +\n +\n\n+\nThe infra team is currently http://lists.jenkins-ci.org/pipermail/jenkins-infra/2015-April/000292.html[targeting this weekend] to migrate our current Confluence instance to this new container, and use the opportunity to move the service to a bigger system. Currently JIRA and Confluence has to live within 2.5GB RAM from the same host, and it's really stretching both services. The new box has 4GB of RAM, and we are splitting JIRA and Confluence to two different servers. So there's a lot of head room. +\n +\n\n+\nSo please expect some Wiki outage over the next weekend. +\n +\n\n+\nAs always, our sincere thank you to https://osuosl.org/[Oregon State University Open Source Lab] for generously hosting our servers.

Full service. As your right arm, Jenkins is the reliable and trustworthy guy you want on your team! +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nhttps://ow.ly/FdEBD[Check out the contest rules] and participate. Let's raise the visibility of Jenkins and have some fun in the process! +\n +\n\nRead Sacha’s blog\n\nLearn more about the contest and how to win Jenkins prizes\n\nGo directly to the #BreakingBuilds images\n\n+","title":"#BreakingBuilds","tags":["general","just for fun","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/kohsuke.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3c6859a9-1166-5f94-931c-b104a18061b1","slug":"/blog/2014/10/20/mobile-app-for-jenkins-user-conference-bay-area/","strippedHtml":"+\nJenkins User Conference in Bay Area is this Thursday, and one of the new things this year is the mobile app. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://doubledutch.me/download/jenkins-user-conference[ +\nimage:https://dl.doubledutch.me/images/downloadiphone.png[image,width=253,height=532] +\n] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThere's an Android version as well as an iPhone version.
