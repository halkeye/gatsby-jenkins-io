We had our share of updates to do for various *.jenkins-ci.org servers. +\n +\n\n+\nJava application servers in general (including one that ships in Jenkins) do not fork off processes like Apache does to serve requests, so the kind of CGI attacks you see on Apache does not apply. We are currently unaware of any vulnerabilities in Jenkins related to CVE-2014-6271, and no plan to issue a patch for that. +\n +\n\n+\nThat said, we did come up with one possible way attackers can exploit vulnerable bash through Jenkins, that you might want to be aware of. +\n +\n\n+\nWhen a build is parameterized, parameters are passed to the processes Jenkins launch as environment variables. So if you have a shell step (which uses `+bash+` by default), and if Eve only has a BUILD permission but not CONFIGURE permission, then Eve can exploit this vulnerability by carefully crafting parameter values, and have the bash runs arbitrary processes on the agent that run the build. +\n +\n\n+\nIn most such scenarios, Eve would have to be an authenticated user on Jenkins. Jenkins also leaves the record of who triggered what build with what parameters, so there's an audit trail. But if your Jenkins fits this description, hopefully this serves as one more reason to update your bash. +\n +\n\n+\nFinally, to get notified of future security advisories from Jenkins, see https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Security+Advisories[this Wiki page].","title":"CVE-2014-6271 impact on Jenkins","tags":["general","news"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/kohsuke.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","id":"328f055c-7ec7-56fc-a626-7b047790e7e1","slug":"/blog/2014/09/24/more-jenkins-related-continuous-delivery-events-in-chicago-washington-dc-and-san-francisco/","strippedHtml":"+\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nThe usual suspects, such as CloudBees, XebiaLabs, SOASTA, PuppetLabs, et al are https://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/[doing a Jenkins-themed continuous delivery event series] called \"cdSummit.\" The event is free, has a nice mix of user/vendor talks, and has an appeal to managers and team leads who are working on and struggling with continuous delivery and automation. +\n +\n\n+\nI've spoken in the past events, and I enjoyed the high-level pitches from various speakers. +\nThe last two events at Paris and London filled up completely, so I suspect others have liked them, too. +\n +\n\n+\nIf you live near Chicago, Washington DC, or San Francisco, check out the date and see if you can make it. https://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/[RSVP is from here].

The degree of adoption of Jenkins is amazing in this part of the world, and we might have to find a bigger venue next year to accomodate everyone who wants to come. +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/12508267@N00/14497395798[image:https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5562/14497395798_52a7c92866_n.jpg[IMG_9716,width=320,height=213]] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nIt turns out most of the talks were in Hebrew, so it was difficult for me to really understand what's going on, but the talks ranged from highly technical ones like how to provision Jenkins from configuration management (the server as welll as jobs), all the way to more culture focused one like how to deploy CD practice in an organization. Companies large and small were well represented, and I met with a number of folks who actively contribute to the community. +\n +\n\n+\nThere were a lot of hall way conversations, and those of us at the booth had busy time. +\n +\n\n+\nThanks everyone who came, thanks JFrog for being on the ground for the event (and congratulations for the new round of funding) and CloudBees for hosting the event. Please let us know if there are things we can do better, and see you again next year! +\n +\n\n+\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/12508267@N00/14680851721[image:https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3903/14680851721_fd36aac023_n.jpg[IMG_9777,width=320,height=213]]\n\n+","title":"JUC Israel report","tags":["general","meetup","news","juc"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/kohsuke.jpeg"},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2014-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"e53918cc-d157-5758-9dd4-f3ea6a301cf8","slug":"/blog/2014/07/01/jenkins-office-hours-dotci/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Hangouts_Icon.png[image] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nTomorrow in Jenkins office hours, Surya Gaddipati will be going over https://github.com/jenkinsci/dotci[DotCi], a package of features that integrates Jenkins closely with GitHub, configuration via .ci.yml file in source tree, built-in Docker support and MongoDB backend. +\n +\n\n+\nI think there's a number of interesting pieces here that could be split into individual plugins for reuse, and possible alignment with existing efforts like https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Script+Security+Plugin[Script Security plugin] or https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Literate+Plugin[Literate plugin]. +\n +\n\n+\nTo record the show, https://plus.google.com/events/cmatf87mb6cfo090e063l10709g[this event will be in a different hangout from the usual one], but https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&iso=20140702T11&p1=224&ah=1&sort=1[the time is the same].
