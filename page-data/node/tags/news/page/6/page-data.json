On Linux, each thread occupies 2MB just for its stack size, so if we can eliminate some of them, it'd be a good saving. +\n +\n\n+\nSo this morning, I tackled one source of such waste. +\n +\n\n+\nJenkins has https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin[the ability to launch agent on a remote server via SSH] for the longest time, and to simplify this, we've been using a https://github.com/jenkinsci/trilead-ssh2[pure-Java implementation of SSH client]. +\n +\n\n+\nTo cut the long story short, I was able to eliminate two pump threads per every SSH connection. Furthermore, when it runs on the upcoming Jenkins 1.521, it'll save one more thread per every SSH connection. So if you have 100 agents connected through SSH, this alone saves up 600MB of memory. That's pretty good for a few hours work! +\n +\n\n+\nIf you run a lot of agents, be sure to pick up version 0.27 of https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin[the SSH agents plugin] to take advantages of this! +","title":"Reducing the # of threads in Jenkins: SSH agents","tags":["development","news","plugins","releases"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","id":"705feeb0-19df-50df-9707-c5368ab86dcb","slug":"/blog/2013/05/22/jenkins-user-conference-israel-coming-june-6/","strippedHtml":"Your favorite Butler will visit Israel on June 6 for the Jenkins User Conference Israel.

So naturally these folks tend to keep things to themselves. +\n +\n\n+\nThat's why I've been wanting to do a meet-up in Seoul for some time, yet I didn't know anyone there to get one going. That changed in Jenkins User Conferene in San Francisco last year. I pitched this to someone who worked for Samsung, and he introduced me to folks in Seoul, and the ball started rolling from there. +\n +\n\n+\nThe meet-up was held Friday, at Samsung headquarter in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0&list=PLEC422D53B7588DC7&index=10[Gangnam], Seoul. +\n +\n\n+\nimage:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Samsung_headquarters.jpg/320px-Samsung_headquarters.jpg[image] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI kicked off the meet-up with a short presentation on why I think local communities are important, especially in Korea. Jang Seung-heui from Samsung then talked about Groovy scripting in Jenkins, and how it helps him manage a large installation of Jenkins (the slides and the talk were in Korean, so this is my guess based on the occasional English words that appeared in slides.) Junho Yoon from NHN talked about his simple update site plugin to show how he helps teams run their own Jenkins instances. I've done another presentation showing various Jenkins plugins for workflow-ish things. +\n +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI wasn't sure how many people would actually come, since I really didn't have any reach in the Korean software developer community. But somehow the words must have spread, as I counted more than 50 people in the room. +\n +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nUnfortunately, due to the rules in the building, I wasn't allowed to record the talks. So no videos from this meet-up — if you missed this one, you'd have to come to the next one! +\n +\n\n+\nAfter the meet-up, a dozen of us headed to the busy night scene in Gangnam. There were so many people that we had to form a line to get to the street! +\n +\n\n+\nEventually we found ourselves in a German-style pub. I say German \"style\" because everything from beer to foods were Korean, except the name of the pub and the wall paper. +\n +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nI've pitched my hope that we keep it going, and that there'll be the next meet-up.

Overall the event was a major success and we’re very happy we were able to take part in it!\n\nFor FOSDEM 2013, we’ll be back in Brussels and participating in a major way. The first day of FOSDEM (February 2, 2013) will be the 2nd birthday for the Jenkins project, and seems appropriate that project founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi will be giving a keynote session titled: \" How we made the Jenkins community \"\n\nHere’s an excerpt from Kohsuke’s talk proposal:\n\nJenkins project has an interesting history. It started from scratch on my spare time, and grow over time to boast 600+ open-source plugins developed by 300+ contributors from all around the world.\n\nThere are several key ingredients, both technical and social, that enabled this model, and I think those ingredients are useful to other projects. In this talk, I’ll discuss how Jenkins project and the community works, what these ingredients are, why they help you attract more developers into your projects, and why it matters.\n\nYou can read more about Kohsuke’s keynote here\n\nIn addition to the keynote, I ( R. Tyler Croy), and a number of members of the Jenkins, Cucumber and Selenium communities are hosting the first ever Testing and Automation devroom at FOSDEM.\n\nIf you’re interested in submitting a talk proposal for the dev room the deadline is 23:59 UTC on December 21st 2012! The Call for Proposals can be found here, and the proposal submission form can can be found here.\n\nWe are very likely going to have a table in the hall again this year, but the FOSDEM committee hasn’t yet confirmed whether or not we will have a table.\n\nRegardless, a lot of Jenkins community members will be at FOSDEM in February in addition to hundreds of other open source contributors and users from around the world.\n\nIf you’re interested in participating and/or meeting up with the Jenkins crowd, there’s details coming together on the FOSDEM wiki page .\n\nWe hope to see you there!","title":"Jenkins keynote at FOSDEM 2013","tags":["general","cia","meetup","news"],"authors":[]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","id":"1759b910-aa31-5ef1-89c7-7ffbe58d9d18","slug":"/blog/2012/09/28/take-the-jenkins-survey/","strippedHtml":"+\nimage:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Paid-surveys.jpg[image,width=200] +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nJust like https://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/12/jenkins-community-survey-results-82.html[the last year], link:/survey[we are running a survey this year], to get some objective insights into what our users would like to see in the project. Obviously, the developers in the project deal with https://issues.jenkins.io[individual bug reports and feature requests] all the time, but sometimes those day-to-day issues distract you from a bigger picture. +\n +\n\n+\nThis year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend. But we also http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2012/jenkins.2012-09-19-18.00.log.html#l-142[discussed what we wanted to ask] among ourselves and revised some more. +\n +\n\n+\nThe tricky thing about being an open-source project is that it's not like some of us can actually decide what we'll be working on — in the end it's up to individual contributors to decide what they want to work on. So I can't make promises, but in a way, that's precisely why we'd like to get these objective, measurable, quantitative feedbacks. It lets us discuss how to solve the problem, instead of spending time discussing what the problem is. +\n +\n\n+\nLast year, we've heard loud and clear that people wanted to see some UI improvements. So a bunch of us sit down at link:/blog/2012/02/21/fosdem-2012-recap/[FOSDEM], picked up several key UI improvements, and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/UI+Enhancements[we've actually delivered on those].
