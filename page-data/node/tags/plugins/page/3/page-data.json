We are working this new Machine Learning Plugin for this GSoC 2020.\nThis is my story about the community bonding of GSoC 2020. I am happy to share my journey with you.\n\nIntroducing Myself and my Fantastic 4 Mentors\n\nI am Loghi Perinpanayagam from University of Moratuwa. I was selected for GSoC 2020 for Machine Learning Plugin in Jenkins. I am glad to introduce my mentors to this project. I was assigned with four mentors who are really enthusiastic to help me on kicking off this summer of code.\n\nStudent\n\nLoghi Perinpanayagam\n\nMentors\n\nBruno P. Kinoshita\n\nIoannis Moutsatsos\n\nMarky Jackson\n\nShivay Lamba\n\nHow was my preparation last year ?\n\nI learned about this open source program in my second year. But atleast I tried last year on a different organization’s project that was related to Data Visualization Recommendation for Data Science. But the problem was I did not contribute as much as this year and was too late in the application process. As usual Machine learning related projects have a lot of competition compared to other projects. I prepared on learning Data visualization in Machine Learning and existing Models for the recommendation system. Finally I wrote a proposal with the SeqToSeq model without much knowledge on neural networks at that time. And I did not communicate much through the dedicated slack channel.  That may be one of the reasons for the failure. But the main reason was my latency for GSoC 2019.\n\nHow did I hurdle GSoC 2020 ?\n\nSince the time I realized how open source is needed and helpful for the community, I have been passionate about contributing to open source projects. At the instance, I finished my internship in Bangalore, India in 2019, I immediately focused on participating in GSoC. This is my last year (2020) as a student of my BSc Computer Science life, I wanted to get selected this year as a student.\n\nThere was a guidance seminar organized by our department, I got to know that Jenkins had opened their project ideas. That was an extremely impressive beginning of my GSoC 2020 journey. I walked through all the draft and accepted projects in the Jenkins.io page. As I am already interested in Machine Learning and I am familiar with Java, I picked the most impressive idea for me that does not have an initial repo. That means I wanted to use my knowledge to think and research a lot with this project. But I had to contribute and want to know about the infrastructure of Jenkins codebase. Because that makes the selection panel easy to pick up the student for the project.  Then I repeatedly searched to contribute to Jenkins. I found issues that were easy for me to work from the git plugin and git client plugin. I started to contribute some test issues on git plugin and git client plugin. After I got a clear knowledge on how a plugin works in Jenkins, I started working on the POC with the hint provided in the project idea page. Actually, that was fun to code.\n\nMentors have helped many students during the application process. I was able to do a working POC that had a minimum capability to do the task of the project. Finally mentors opened for proposal submission. I hurried to prepare a draft proposal. After I got reviews from mentors, I started to improve the proposal. At the end of the proposal submission, I was able to deliver a good proposal for this project. As I was curious about this plugin, I dug into more on how to integrate Jupyter notebook with this plugin. I published an medium article as a result of my research during the acceptance waiting period.\n\nResults released\n\nThe result was going to be announced on 4th May, I believed in my project proposal and POC and I got selected for this GSoC 2020. Whoa ! That was a goosebumping moment in my entire life. The feeling was like Something I achieved. As a result of my hard work, I deserved that.\nFor example, I spent 7 days continuously making the POC work without any collision between maven artifacts.\n\nCommunity Bonding\n\nAfter the release of results, I was preparing myself for the community bonding. There are lots of interactions happening between me and mentors than before.I had to update my project page and my profile in Jenkins.io. We had our first meeting with lots of excitement and love on 10th of May. Mentors and I introduced ourselves even though we know each other. We discussed the high level view of GSoC and I asked some questions that I had in my mind. As my plugin was a new repository, most of the discussion was related to the repository and its name. I had  to find a name for the new plugin. We had regular conversations about the blogpost and presentations at the end.\n\nIn the second meeting, We discussed the process for hosting a new plugin in Jenkins, tracking issues with JIRA, blog posts and high level road map for the project. And I suggested some interesting plugin names but they were not matching to the goal of the project, mentors told me to try other names which perfectly describe the project. I was advised to read all the research guidelines and plugin naming conventions. We discussed how code reviews will be done and source code management through the git. After this meeting, our meeting has shifted to the official Jenkins Zoom account.\n\nOur third meeting was quite serious about our project planning. I had been preparing my design document for the project with the help of mentors before the meeting day. Hence I got lots of reviews and useful examples for my future work on phase 1. At this point, we decided with the plugin name Machine Learning Plugin which was accepted by all mentors and I created the repo and requested a Jira ticket for the plugin hosting request. We were planning to remind the Jira ticket within the next 3 days. Mentors want me to make sure I updated the Jenkins GSoC page before the community period ends. Lots of discussion carried about the design document that I had been preparing last week before the meeting. Some important points from the meeting notes follows :\n\nDefine features in the design document\n\nDiagrams for the operations\n\nHow plugin works in distributed environment\n\nCode editor library\n\nRequirements for the first Plugin release\n\nBlog post draft document\n\nToDo works for me for next week\n\nTherefore, I had to work hard after this meeting, this made me involved in the project more. I have to put my huge effort to make this opportunity golden. Our team has the willingness to complete this project and will definitely help the Data Science community with this plugin.\nKudos to my team for the amazing work so far!!!\n\nThis was my entire journey until now. Hope you enjoyed it and hope you learned the mistakes I made last year and corrected in this summer.\nThanks for reading, and Stay tuned I will be uploading blog posts for those of you interested.\n\nResources and Links\n\nProject page\n\nDesign document","title":"Machine Learning Plugin project - community bonding blog post","tags":["machinelearning","datascience","plugins","communitybonding","gsoc","gsoc2020"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/9b030/loghijiaha.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/f38b5/loghijiaha.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/63ad2/loghijiaha.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/bcd2b/loghijiaha.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/ceea6/loghijiaha.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/45b82/loghijiaha.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/933cd/loghijiaha.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/75c9c309d675728b2e2735d64a019887/6c13d/loghijiaha.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":158}}},"blog":null,"github":"loghijiaha","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Computer Science and Engineering Student at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

There\nare plugins available to render the test results, the code coverage, the static analysis and so on. All of these plugins\ntypically pick up the build results of a given build step and show them in the user interface. In order to render these\ndetails most of the plugins use static HTML pages, since this type of user interface is the standard visualization in\nJenkins since its inception in 2007.\n\nIn order to improve the look and feel and the user experience of these plugins it makes sense to move forward and\nincorporate some modern Java Script libraries and components. Since development of Blue Ocean has been stopped (see\nJenkins mailing list post)\nplugin authors need to decide on their own, which UI technologies are helpful for that task. However, the universe of\nmodern UI components is so overwhelming that it makes sense to pick up only a small set of components that are proven\nto be useful and compatible with Jenkins underlying web technologies. Moreover, the initial setup of\nincorporating such a new component is quite large so it would be helpful if that work needs to be done only once.\n\nThis guide introduces a few UI components\nthat make sense to be used by all plugin authors in the future to provide a rich user interface for reports in Jenkins.\nIn order to simplify the usage of these libraries in the context of Jenkins as a Java based web application, these\nJava Script libraries and components have been packaged as ordinary Jenkins plugins.\n\nIn the following sections, these new components will be introduced step by step. In order to see how these components\ncan be used a plugin, I demonstrate the new features while enhancing the existing\nForensics Plugin with a new user\ninterface. Since the Warnings Next Generation Plugin also uses these new components, you can see additional examples\nin the documentation of the warnings plugin\nor in our public ci.jenkins.io instance, that\nalready is using these components in the detail views of the warnings plugin.\n\n1. New user interface plugins\n\nThe following UI components are provided as new Jenkins plugins:\n\njquery3-api-plugin :\nProvides jQuery 3 for Jenkins Plugins.\njQuery is — as described on their home page — a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things\nlike HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API\nthat works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the\nway that millions of people write JavaScript.\n\nbootstrap4-api-plugin :\nProvides Bootstrap 4 for Jenkins Plugins. Bootstrap is — according to their self-perception — the world’s most popular front-end component library to build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. It is\nan open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Developers can quickly prototype their ideas or\nbuild entire apps with their Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins\nbuilt on jQuery.\n\ndata-tables-api-plugin :\nProvides DataTables for Jenkins Plugins.\nDataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library. It is a highly flexible tool, built upon the foundations\nof progressive enhancement, that adds all of these advanced features to any HTML table:\n\nPrevious, next and page navigation\n\nFilter results by text search\n\nSort data by multiple columns at once\n\nDOM, Javascript, Ajax and server-side processing\n\nEasily theme-able\n\nMobile friendly\n\necharts-api-plugin :\nProvides ECharts for Jenkins Plugins. ECharts is an open-sourced\nJavaScript visualization tool to create intuitive, interactive, and highly-customizable charts. It\ncan run fluently on PC and mobile devices and it is compatible with most modern\nWeb Browsers.\n\nfont-awesome-api-plugin :\nProvides Font Awesome for Jenkins Plugins. Font Awesome has vector icons and social logos,\naccording to their self-perception it is the web’s most popular icon set and toolkit. Currently, it contains more than\n1,500 free icons.\n\npopper-api-plugin\nProvides Popper.js for Jenkins Plugins. Popper can\neasily position tooltips, popovers or anything else with just a line of code.\n\nplugin-util-api-plugin : This small plugin provides\nsome helper and base classes to simplify the creation of reporters in Jenkins. This plugin also\nprovides a set of architecture rules that can be included in an architecture test suite of your plugin.\n\n2. Required changes for a plugin POM\n\nIn order to use these plugins you need to add them as dependencies in your plugin pom. You can use the following snippet\nto add them all:\n\npom.xml\n\n[...]\n\n1.0.2\n5.12.0-7\n4.4.1-10\n4.6.0-8\n1.10.20-13\n[...]\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\nplugin-util-api\n${plugin-util-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\nfont-awesome-api\n${font-awesome-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\nbootstrap4-api\n${bootstrap4-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\necharts-api\n${echarts-api.version}\n\nio.jenkins.plugins\ndata-tables-api\n${data-tables-api.version}\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\nAlternatively, you have a look at the POM files of the\nWarnings Next Generation Plugin or the\nForensics API Plugin which already use these\nplugins.\n\n3. General structure of a reporter\n\nIn this section I will explain some fundamentals of the design of Jenkins, i.e. the Java model and the associated\nuser interface elements. If you are already familiar on how to implement the corresponding extension points of a\nreporter plugin (see section Extensibility in Jenkins'\ndeveloper guide), then you can skip this section and head directly to Section 3.1.\n\nJenkins organizes projects using the static object model structure shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Jenkins design - high level view of the Java model\n\nThe top level items in Jenkins user interface are jobs (at least the top level items\nwe are interested in). Jenkins contains several jobs of different types (Freestyle jobs, Maven Jobs, Pipelines, etc.).\n\nEach of these jobs contains an arbitrary number of builds (or more technically, runs). Each build is identified by its\nunique build number. Jenkins plugins can attach results to these builds, e.g. build artifacts, test results,\nanalysis reports, etc. In order to attach such a result, a plugin technically needs to implement and create an action\nthat stores these results.\n\nThese Java objects are visualized in several different views, which are described in more detail in the following\nsections. The top-level view that shows all available Jobs is shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Jenkins view showing all available jobs\n\nPlugins can also contribute UI elements in these views, but this is out of scope of this guide.\n\nEach job has a detail view, where plugins can extend corresponding extension points and provide summary boxes and\ntrend charts. Typically, summary boxes for reporters are not required on the job level, so I describe only trend charts\nin more detail, see section Section 5.5.2.\n\nFigure 3. Jenkins view showing details about a job\n\nEach build has a detail view as well. Here plugins can provide summary boxes similar to the boxes for the job details\nview. Typically, plugins show here only a short summary and provide a link to detailed results, see Figure 4 for\nan example.\n\nFigure 4. Jenkins view showing details about a build\n\nThe last element in the view hierarchy actually is a dedicated view that shows the results of a specific plugin. E.g.,\nthere are views to show the test results, the analysis results, and so on. It is totally up to a given plugin what\nelements should be shown there. In the next few sections I will introduce some new UI components that can be used\nto show the corresponding results in a pleasant way.\n\n3.1. Extending Jenkins object model\n\nSince reporters typically are composed in a similar way, I extended Jenkins' original object model\n(see Figure 1) with some additional elements, so it will be much simpler to create or implement\na new reporter plugin. This new model is shown in Figure 5. The central element is a build action that\nwill store the results of a plugin reporter. This action will be attached to each build and will hold (and persist) the\nresults for a reporter. The detail data of each action will be automatically stored in an additional file, so the\nmemory footprint of Jenkins can be kept small if the details are never requested by users. Additionally, this\naction is also used to simplify the creation of project actions and trend charts, see Section 5.5.2.\n\nFigure 5. Jenkins reporter design - high level view of the model for reporter plugins\n\n4. Git Forensics plugin\n\nThe elements in this tutorial will be all used in the new\nForensics API Plugin (actually the plugin is not new, it is a dependency of the\nWarnings Next Generation Plugin). You can download the plugin content\nand see in more detail how these new components can be used in practice. Or you can change this plugin just to see\nhow these new components can be parametrized.\n\nIf you are using Git as source code management system then this plugin will mine\nthe repository in the style of\nCode as a Crime Scene\n(Adam Tornhill, November 2013) to determine statistics of the contained source code files:\n\ntotal number of commits\n\ntotal number of different authors\n\ncreation time\n\nlast modification time\n\nThe plugin provides a new step (or post build publisher) that starts the repository mining and stores\nthe collected information in a Jenkins action (see Figure 5). Afterwards you get a new\nbuild summary that shows the total number of scanned files (as trend and as build result). From\nhere you can navigate to the details view that shows the scanned files in a table that can be\nsimply sorted and filtered. You also will get some pie charts that show important aspects of the\ncommit history.\n\nPlease note that this functionality of the plugin still is a proof of concept: the performance of this step heavily\ndepends on the size and the number of commits of your Git repository. Currently it scans the whole repository in each\nbuild. In the near future I hope to find a volunteer who is interested in replacing this dumb algorithm with an incremental scanner.\n\n5. Introducing the new  UI components\n\nAs already mentioned in Section 3, a details view is plugin specific. What is shown and how these\nelements are presented is up to the individual plugin author. So in the next sections I provide some examples\nand new concepts that plugins can use as building blocks for their own content.\n\n5.1. Modern icons\n\nJenkins plugins typically do not use icons very frequently. Most plugins provide an icon for the actions and that’s it.\nIf you intend to use icons in other places, plugin authors are left on their own: the recommended Tango icon set is more\nthan 10 years old and too limited nowadays. There are several options available, but the most popular is the\nFont Awesome Icon Set. It provides more than 1500 free icons that follow the same\ndesign guidelines:\n\nFigure 6. Font Awesome icons in Jenkins plugins\n\nIn order to use Font Awesome icons in a plugin you simply need a dependency to the corresponding\nfont-awesome-api-plugin. Then you can use any of the solid icons\nby using the new tag svg-icon in your jelly view:\n\nindex.jelly\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\nIf you are generating views using Java code, then you also can use the class SvgTag to generate the\nHTML markup for such an icon.\n\n5.2. Grid layout\n\nJenkins currently includes in all views an old and patched version of Boostrap’s grid system (with 24 columns). This version\nis not compatible with Boostrap 4 or any of the JS libraries that depend on Bootstrap4. In order to use Bootstrap 4\nfeatures we need to replace the Jenkins provided layout.jelly file with a patched version, that does not load\nthe broken grid system. I’m planning to create a PR that fixes the grid in Jenkins core, but that will take some time.\nUntil then you will need to use the provided layout.jelly of the Boostrap4 plugin, see below.\n\nThe first thing to decide is, which elements should be shown on a plugin page and how much space each element\nshould occupy. Typically, all visible components are mapped on the available space using a simple grid.\nIn a Jenkins view we have a fixed header and footer and a navigation bar on the left\n(20 percent of the horizontal space). The rest of a screen can be used by\na details view. In order to simplify the distribution of elements in that remaining space we use\nBootstrap’s grid system.\n\nFigure 7. Jenkins layout with a details view that contains a grid system\n\nThat means, a view is split into 12 columns and and arbitrary number of rows. This grid system is simple to use\n(but complex enough to also support fancy screen layouts) - I won’t go into\ndetails here, please refer to the Bootstrap documentation\nfor details.\n\nFor the forensics detail view we use a simple grid of two rows and two columns. Since the number of columns always is 12\nwe need to create two \"fat\" columns that fill 6 of the standard columns.\nIn order to create such a view in our\nplugin we need to create a view given as a jelly file and a corresponding Java view model object. A view with this layout\nis shown in the following snippet:\n\nindex.jelly\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n(4)\n(5)\nContent of column 1 in row 1\n\n(6)\nContent of column 2 in row 1\n\n(7)\n(8)\nContent of row 2\n\n1\nUse a custom layout based on Bootstrap: since Jenkins core contains an old version of Bootstrap,\nwe need to replace the standard layout.jelly file.\n\n2\nImport Bootstrap 4: Importing of JS and CSS components is done using the adjunct concept,\nwhich is the preferred way of referencing static resources within Jenkins' Stapler Web framework.\n\n3\nThe whole view will be placed into a fluid container that fills up the whole screen (100% width).\n\n4\nA new row of the view is specified with class row. The additional class py-3 defines the padding to use for\nthis row, see Bootstrap Spacing for more details.\n\n5\nSince Bootstrap automatically splits up a row into 12 equal sized columns we define here\nthat the first column should occupy 6 of these 12 columns. You can also leave off the detailed numbers, then Bootstrap will\nautomatically distribute the content in the available space. Just be aware that this not what you want in most of the times.\n\n6\nThe second column uses the remaining space, i.e. 6 of the 12 columns.\n\n7\nThe second row uses the same layout as row 1.\n\n8\nThere is only one column for row 1, it will fill the whole available space.\n\nYou can also specify different column layouts for one row, based on the actual visible size of the screen.\nThis helps to improve the layout for larger screens. In the warnings plugin you will find\nan example: on small devices, there is one card visible that shows one pie chart in a carousel. If you are\nopening the same page on a larger device, then two of the pie charts are shown side by side and the carousel is hidden.\n\n5.3. Cards\n\nWhen presenting information of a plugin as a block, typically plain text elements are shown. This will normally result\nin some kind of boring web pages. In order to create a more appealing interface, it makes sense to present such information\nin a card, that has a border, a header, an icon, and so on. In order to create such a\nBootstrap card a small jelly tag has been provided by the new\nBootstrap plugin that simplifies this task for a plugin.\nSuch a card can be easily created in a jelly view in the following way:\n\nContent of the card\n\nIn Figure 8 examples of such cards are shown. The cards in the upper row contain pie charts that show the\ndistribution of the number of authors and commits in the whole repository. The card at the bottom shows the detail\ninformation in a DataTable. The visualization is not limited to charts or tables, you can\nshow any kind of HTML content in there. You can show any icon of your\nplugin in these cards, but it is recommended to use one of the existing Font Awesome icons\nto get a consistent look and feel in Jenkins' plugin ecosystem.\n\nFigure 8. Bootstraps cards in Jenkins plugins\n\nNote that the size of the cards is determined by the grid configuration, see Section 5.2.\n\n5.4. Tables\n\nA common UI element to show plugin details is a table control. Most plugins (and Jenkins core) typically use\nplain HTML tables. However, if the table should show a large number of rows then using a more sophisticated control\nlike DataTables makes more sense. Using this JS based table control provides additional\nfeatures at no cost:\n\nfilter results by text search\n\nprovide pagination of the result set\n\nsort data by multiple columns at once\n\nobtain table rows using Ajax calls\n\nshow and hide columns based on the screen resolution\n\nIn order to use DataTables in a view there are two options, you can either decorate existing\nstatic HTML tables (see Section 5.4.1) or populate the table content using Ajax (see Section 5.4.2).\n\n5.4.1. Tables with static HTML content\n\nThe easiest way of using DataTables is by creating a static HTML table that will be decorated by simply calling the\nconstructor of the datatable. This approach involves no special handling on the Java and Jelly side, so I think it is\nsufficient to follow the example in the DataTables\ndocumentation. Just make sure that after building the table in your Jelly file you need to decorate the table\nwith the following piece of code:\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\n1\nreplace id with the ID of your HTML table element\n\nIn the Forensics plugin no such static table is used so far, but you can have a look at the\ntable that shows fixed warnings\nin the warnings plugin to see how such a table can be decorated.\n\n5.4.2. Tables with dynamic model based content\n\nWhile static HTML tables are easy to implement, they have several limitations. So it makes sense to follow a more\nsophisticated approach. Typically, tables in user interfaces are defined by using a corresponding table (and row) model.\nJava Swing successfully provides such a\ntable model concept since the early days of Java.\nI adapted these concepts for Jenkins and DataTables as well. In order to create a table in a Jenkins view a plugin\nneeds to provide a table model class, that provides the following information:\n\nthe ID of the table (since there might be several tables in the view)\n\nthe model of the columns (i.e., the number, type, and header labels of the columns)\n\nthe content of the table (i.e. the individual row objects)\n\nYou will find an example of such a table in the Forensics plugin: here a table lists\nthe files in your Git repository combined with the corresponding commit statistics (number of authors,\nnumber of commits, last modification, first commit). A screenshot of that table is shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9. Dynamic Table in the Forensics plugin\n\nIn order to create such a table in Jenkins, you need to create a table model class that derives from TableModel.\nIn Figure 10 a diagram of the corresponding classes in the Forensics plugin is shown.\n\nFigure 10. Table model of the Forensics plugin\n\nTable column model\n\nThis first thing a table model class defines is a model of the available columns by creating corresponding\nTableColumn instances. For each column you need to specify a header label and the name of the bean property that\nshould be shown in the corresponding column (the row elements are actually Java beans: each column will\nshow one distinct property of such a bean, see next section). You can\nuse any of the supported column types by simply providing a\nString or Integer based column.\n\nTable rows content\n\nAdditionally, a table model class provides the content of the rows. This getRows() method\nwill be invoked asynchronously using an Ajax call. Typically, this method simply returns a list of Java Bean instances,\nthat provide the properties of each column (see previous section). These objects will be converted automatically\nto an array of JSON objects, the basic data structure required for the DataTables API.\nYou will find a fully working example table model\nimplementation in the Git repository of the forensics plugin in the class\nForensicsTableModel.\n\nIn order to use such a table in your plugin view you need to create the table in the associated\nJelly file using the new table tag:\n\nindex.jelly\n\n[...]\n\n(1)\n[...]\n\n1\nreplace id with the id of your table\n\nThe only parameter you need to provide for the table is the model — it is typically part of the corresponding\nJenkins view model class (this object is referenced with ${it} in the view).\nIn order to connect the corresponding Jenkins view model class with the table, the view model class needs to\nimplement the AsyncTableContentProvider interface. Or even simpler, let your view model class derive from\nDefaultAsyncTableContentProvider. This relationship is required, so that Jenkins can automatically create\nand bind a proxy for the Ajax calls that will automatically fill the table content after the HTML page has been created.\n\nIf we put all those pieces together, we are required to define a model similar to the model of the Forensics plugin,\nthat is shown in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11. Jenkins reporter design - high level view of the model for reporter plugins\n\nAs already described in Figure 5 the plugin needs to attach a BuildAction to each build. The\nForensics plugin attaches a ForensicBuildAction to the build. This action stores a RepositoryStatistics instance,\nthat contains the repository results for a given build. This action delegates all Stapler requests to a new\nstaplerdoc:org.kohsuke.stapler.StaplerProxy[Stapler proxy instance] so we can keep the\naction clean of user interface code. This ForensicsViewModel class then acts as view model that provides the server\nside model for the corresponding Jelly view given by the file index.jelly.\n\nWhile this approach looks quite complex at a first view, you will see that the actual implementation part\nis quite small. Most of the boilerplate code is already provided by the base classes and you need to implement\nonly a few methods. Using this concept also provides some additional features, that are part of the DataTables plugin:\n\nOrdering of columns is persisted automatically in the browser local storage.\n\nPaging size is persisted automatically in the browser local storage.\n\nThe Ajax calls are actually invoked only if a table will become visible. So if you have\nseveral tables hidden in tabs then the content will be loaded on demand only, reducing the amount of data\nto be transferred.\n\nThere is an option available to provide an additional details row that can be expanded with a + symbol,\nsee warnings plugin table for details.\n\n5.5. Charts\n\nA plugin reporter typically also reports some kind of trend from build to build. Up to now Jenkins core provides only a\nquite limited concept of rendering such trends as trend charts. The\nJFreeChart framework offered by Jenkins core is a server\nside rendering engine that creates charts as static PNG images that will be included on the job and details pages.\nNowadays, several powerful JS based charting libraries are available, that do the same job\n(well actually an even better job) on the client side. That has the advantage that these charts can be customized\non each client without affecting the server performance. Moreover, you get a lot of additional\nfeatures (like zooming, animation, etc.) for free. Additionally, these charting libraries not only support the typical\nbuild trend charts but also a lot of additional charts types that can be used to improve the user experience of\na plugin.\nOne of those charting libraries is ECharts : this library has a powerful API\nand supports literally every chart type one can image of. You can get some impressions of the features on the\nexamples page of the library.\n\nIn order to use these charts one can embed charts that use this library by importing the corresponding JS files and by\ndefining the chart in the corresponding Jelly file. While that already works quite well it\nwill be still somewhat cumbersome to provide the corresponding model for these charts from Jenkins build results. So\nI added a powerful Java API that helps to create the model for these charts on the Java side. This API provides the\nfollowing features:\n\nCreate trend charts based on a collection of build results.\n\nSeparate the chart type from the aggregation in order to simplify unit testing of the chart model.\n\nToggle the type of the X-Axis between build number or build date (with automatic aggregation of results that\nhave been recorded at the same day).\n\nAutomatic conversion of the Java model to the required JSON model for the JS side.\n\nSupport for pie and line charts (more to come soon).\n\nThose charts can be used as trend chart in the project page (see Figure 3) or as information chart in the details\nview of a plugin (see Section 5).\n\n5.5.1. Pie charts\n\nA simple but still informative chart is a pie chart that illustrates numerical proportions of plugin data. In the Forensics\nplugin I am using this chart to show the numerical proportions of the number of authors or commits for the\nsource code files in the Git repository (see Figure 8). In the warnings plugin I use this chart to show the\nnumerical proportions of the new, outstanding, or fixed warnings, see Figure 12.\n\nFigure 12. Pie chart in the Warnings plugin\n\nIn order to include such a chart in your details view, you can use the provided pie-chart tag.\nIn the following snippet you see this tag in action (embedded in a Bootstrap card, see Section 5.3):\n\nindex.jelly\n\n[...]\n<c:pie-chart id=\"authors\" model=\"${it.authorsModel}\" height=\"256\" />\n\n[...]\n\nYou need to provide a unique ID for this chart and the corresponding model value. The model must be the JSON\nrepresentation of a corresponding PieChartModel instance. Such a model can be created with a couple of lines:\n\nViewModel.java\n\n[...]\n    PieChartModel model = new PieChartModel(\"Title\");\n\n    model.add(new PieData(\"Segment 1 name\", 10), Palette.RED);\n    model.add(new PieData(\"Segment 2 name\", 15), Palette.GREEN);\n    model.add(new PieData(\"Segment 3 name\", 20), Palette.YELLOW);\n\n    String json = new JacksonFacade().toJson(model);\n    [...]\n\n5.5.2. Trend charts on the job level view\n\nIn order to show a trend that renders a line chart on the job page (see Figure 3) you need to provide a so called\nfloating box (stored in the file floatingBox.jelly of your job action (see Section 3)).\nThe content of this file is quite simple and contains just a trend-chart tag:\n\nfloatingBox.jelly\n\n<c:trend-chart it=\"${from}\" title=\"${%SCM Files Count Trend}\" enableLinks=\"true\"/>\n\nOn the Java side the model for the chart needs to be provided in the corresponding sub class of JobAction (which is\nthe owner of the floating box). Since the computation of trend charts is quite expensive on the server side as well\n(several builds need to be read from disk and the interesting data points need to be computed) this process has been\nput into a separate background job. Once the computation is done the result is shown via an Ajax call. In order to\nhide these details for plugin authors you should simply derive your JobAction class from the corresponding\nAsyncTrendJobAction class, that already contains the boilerplate code. So your static plugin object model will actually\nbecome a little bit more complex:\n\nFigure 13. Jenkins chart model design\n\nBasically, you need to implement the method LinesChartModel createChartModel() to create the line\nchart. This method is quite simple to implement, since most of the hard work is provided by the library: you will\ninvoke with an iterator of your build actions, starting with the latest build. The iterator advances from build to build\nuntil no more results are available (or the maximum number of builds to consider has been reached). The most important\nthing to implement in your plugin is the way how data points are computed for a given BuildAction. Here is an example of\nsuch a SeriesBuilder implementation in the Forensics Plugin:\n\nFilesCountSeriesBuilder.java\n\npackage io.jenkins.plugins.forensics.miner;\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\nimport edu.hm.hafner.echarts.SeriesBuilder;\n\n/**\n * Builds one x-axis point for the series of a line chart showing the number of files in the repository.\n *\n * @author Ullrich Hafner\n */\npublic class FilesCountSeriesBuilder extends SeriesBuilder {\n    static final String TOTALS_KEY = \"total\";\n\n    @Override\n    protected Map computeSeries(final ForensicsBuildAction current) {\n        Map series = new HashMap<>();\n        series.put(TOTALS_KEY, current.getNumberOfFiles());\n        return series;\n    }\n}\n\nYou are not limited to a single line chart. You can show several lines in a single chart, you can show stacked values,\nor even the delta between some values. You can also have a look at the\ncharts of the warnings plugin\nto see some of these features in detail.\n\nFigure 14. Trend chart with several lines in the Warnings plugin\n\nFigure 15.

In this post I’ll show how the new AWS Secrets Manager Credentials Provider plugin allows you to marshal your secrets into one place, and use them securely from Jenkins.\n\nWhen CI/CD pipelines moved to the public cloud, credential management did not evolve with them. If you’re in this situation, you may have seen a number of tactical workarounds to keep Jenkins builds talking to the services they depend on. The workarounds range from bad (hardcoding plaintext secrets into Git) to merely painful (wrangling Hiera EYAML), but their common feature is that they tend to make copies of secrets beyond the reach of automation. This increases their attack surface, makes routine key rotation impractical, and makes remediation difficult after a breach.\n\nThe good news is that there is a better way!\n\nAWS Secrets Manager is a comprehensive solution for secure secret storage. You define a secret just once for your whole AWS account, then you give your consumers permission to use the secrets. Secrets Manager lets you manage a secret entry (name and metadata) separately from its value, and it integrates with other AWS services that you already use:\n\nSecret entry management: Manual (Web console, AWS CLI) or with an infrastructure management tool ( Terraform, CloudFormation etc.)\n\nSecret value management: Manual (Web console, AWS CLI) or automatic (secret rotation Lambda function).\n\nAccess control: AWS IAM policies (for both applications and human operators).\n\nSecret encryption: Amazon KMS automatically encrypts the secret value. Use either the account’s default KMS key, or a customer-managed KMS key.\n\nAuditing: AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Events.\n\nA couple of teams in my company started to use Secrets Manager from Jenkins jobs by calling the AWS CLI, but this remained a niche approach as it was quite unwieldy. There was clearly an appetite to integrate key developer apps with a centralised secrets store, but production-ready integrations were needed for wider adoption. So this year I created the AWS Secrets Manager Credentials Provider plugin for Jenkins, with help from friends in the Jenkins community, to do exactly that.\n\nThis is how you set it up…​\n\nInstall the plugin from the Jenkins update center.\n\nGive Jenkins read-only access to Secrets Manager with an IAM policy.\n\n(Optional) Configure the plugin, either through the Global Configuration screen or Jenkins Configuration As Code.\n\nThis is how you use it…​\n\nCreate your build secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. (You can start by uploading secrets via the AWS CLI. More sophisticated methods of secret creation are also available.)\n\nView the credentials in the Jenkins UI, to check that Jenkins can see them.\n\nBind the credentials by ID in your Jenkins job.\n\nThe provider supports the following standard Jenkins credential types:\n\nSecret Text\n\nUsername With Password\n\nSSH User Private Key\n\nPKCS#12 Certificate\n\nAnd it has powerful advantages over quick-fix tactical solutions:\n\nYour Jenkins jobs consume the credentials with no knowledge of Secrets Manager, so they stay vendor-independent.\n\nThe provider caches relevant Secrets Manager API calls, for a quicker and more reliable experience.\n\nThe provider integrates with the ecosystem of existing Jenkins credential consumers, such as the Git and SSH Agent plugins.\n\nThe provider records credential usage in the central Jenkins credentials tracking log.\n\nJenkins can use multiple credentials providers concurrently, so you can incrementally migrate credentials to Secrets Manager while consuming other credentials from your existing providers.\n\nAfter the plugin’s first public release, developers at other companies adopted it too. It has had contributions so far from people at Elsevier, GoDaddy, and Northeastern University, as well as the fantastic Jenkins core team. We even got fan mail for our work!\n\nIn enterprise security, \"The important things are always simple. The simple things are always hard. The easy way is always mined.\" ( @thegrugq) It’s easy to buy a shiny ‘next generation' security appliance and drop it into your network. But it’s hard to embed the security fundamentals (like secrets management, OS patching, secure development) across your organisation. This Jenkins plugin is part of the effort [ 1 ] to take one of the persistent hard problems in security, and make it easier for everyone.\n\n1.

The examples in this post are modeled after the declarative pipeline\nmatrix examples.\n\nMatrix building with scripted pipeline\n\nThe following Jenkins scripted pipeline will build combinations across two\nmatrix axes.

The node\nexpression os:linux && browser:firefox will search for Jenkins agents which\nhave both labels.\n\nScreenshot of matrix pipeline\n\nThe following is a screenshot of the pipeline code above running in a sandbox\nJenkins environment.\n\nAdding static choices\n\nIt is useful for users to be able to customize building matrices when a build\nis triggered.  Adding static choices requires only a few changes to the above\nscript.  Static choices as in we hard code the question and matrix filters.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\n(response['PLATFORM'] == 'all' || response['PLATFORM'] == axis['PLATFORM']) &&\n    (response['BROWSER'] == 'all' || response['BROWSER'] == axis['BROWSER']) &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'safari' && axis['PLATFORM'] == 'linux') &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'edge' && axis['PLATFORM'] != 'windows')\n}\n\nThe pipeline code then renders the following choice dialog.\n\nWhen a user chooses the customized options, the pipeline reacts to the\nrequested options.\n\nAdding dynamic choices\n\nDynamic choices means the choice dialog for users to customize the build is\ngenerated from the Map matrix_axes rather than being something a pipeline\ndeveloper hard codes.\n\nFor user experience (UX), you’ll want your choices to automatically reflect the\nmatrix axis options you have available.  For example, let’s say you want to add\na new dimension for Java to the matrix.\n\n// you can add more axes and this will still work\nMap matrix_axes = [\n    PLATFORM: ['linux', 'windows', 'mac'],\n    JAVA: ['openjdk8', 'openjdk10', 'openjdk11'],\n    BROWSER: ['firefox', 'chrome', 'safari', 'edge']\n]\n\nTo support dynamic choices, your choice and matrix axis filter needs to be\nupdated to the following.\n\nchoice(\n                choices: ['all'] + options.sort(),\n                description: \"Choose a single ${key.toLowerCase()} or all to run tests.\",\n                name: key)\n        })\n}\n\n// filter the matrix axes since\n// Safari is not available on Linux and\n// Edge is only available on Windows\nList axes = getMatrixAxes(matrix_axes).findAll { axis ->\n    response.every { key, choice ->\n        choice == 'all' || choice == axis[key]\n    } &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'safari' && axis['PLATFORM'] == 'linux') &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'edge' && axis['PLATFORM'] != 'windows')\n}\n\nIt will dynamically generate choices based on available matrix axes and will\nautomatically filter if users customize it.

Take two simple lists\nand create combinations.\n\nList a = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nList b = [1, 2, 3]\n\n[a, b].combinations()\n\nThe result of [a, b].combinations() is the following.\n\n[\n    ['a', 1],\n    ['b', 1],\n    ['c', 1],\n    ['a', 2],\n    ['b', 2],\n    ['c', 2],\n    ['a', 3],\n    ['b', 3],\n    ['c', 3]\n]\n\nInstead of a, b, c and 1, 2, 3 let’s do the same example again but instead using matrix maps.\n\nList java = [[java: 8], [java: 10]]\nList os = [[os: 'linux'], [os: 'freebsd']]\n\n[java, os].combinations()\n\nThe result of [java, os].combinations() is the following.\n\n[\n    [ [java:8],  [os:linux]   ],\n    [ [java:10], [os:linux]   ],\n    [ [java:8],  [os:freebsd] ],\n    [ [java:10], [os:freebsd] ]\n]\n\nIn order for us to easily use this as a single map we must add the maps\ntogether to create a single map.  For example, adding\n[java: 8] + [os: 'linux'] will render a single hashmap\n[java: 8, os: 'linux'].  This means we need our list of lists of maps to\nbecome a simple list of maps so that we can use them effectively in pipelines.\n\nTo accomplish this we make use of the\nGroovy spread\noperator ( *. in axes.combinations()*.sum()).\n\nLet’s see the same java / os example again but with the spread operator being\nused.\n\nList java = [[java: 8], [java: 10]]\nList os = [[os: 'linux'], [os: 'freebsd']]\n\n[java, os].combinations()*.sum()\n\nThe result is the following.\n\n[\n    [ java: 8,  os: 'linux'],\n    [ java: 10, os: 'linux'],\n    [ java: 8,  os: 'freebsd'],\n    [ java: 10, os: 'freebsd']\n]\n\nWith the spread operator the end result of a list of maps which we can\neffectively use as matrix axes.  It also allows us to do neat matrix filtering\nwith the findAll {} Groovy List method.\n\nExposing a shared library pipeline step\n\nThe best user experience is to expose the above code as a shared library\npipeline step.  As an example, I have added\nvars/getMatrixAxes.groovy\nto Jervis.  This provides a flexible shared library step which you can copy\ninto your own shared pipeline libraries.\n\nThe step becomes easy to use in the following way with a simple one dimension matrix.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\nMap matrix_axes = [\n    PLATFORM: ['linux', 'windows', 'mac'],\n]\n\nList axes = getMatrixAxes(matrix_axes)\n\n// alternately with a user prompt\n//List axes = getMatrixAxes(matrix_axes, user_prompt: true)\n\nHere’s a more complex example using a two dimensional matrix with filtering.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\n!(axis['BROWSER'] == 'safari' && axis['PLATFORM'] == 'linux') &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'edge' && axis['PLATFORM'] != 'windows')\n}\n\nAnd again with a three dimensional matrix with filtering and prompting for user\ninput.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\n!(axis['BROWSER'] == 'safari' && axis['PLATFORM'] == 'linux') &&\n    !(axis['BROWSER'] == 'edge' && axis['PLATFORM'] != 'windows')\n}\n\nThe script approval is not necessary for\nShared Libraries.\n\nIf you don’t want to provide a shared step.  In order to expose matrix building\nto end-users, you must allow the following method approval in the script\napproval configuration.\n\nScript approval\n\nstaticMethod org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.DefaultGroovyMethods combinations java.util.Collection\n\nSummary\n\nWe covered how to perform matrix builds using scripted pipeline as well as how\nto prompt users for customizing the matrix build.  Additionally, an example was\nprovided where we exposed getting buildable matrix axes to users as an easy to\nuse Shared Library\nstep via vars/getMatrixAxes.groovy.  Using a shared library step is\ndefinitely the recommended way for admins to support users rather than trying\nto whitelist groovy methods.\n\nJervis shared pipeline library has supported matrix building since 2017 in Jenkins scripted pipelines.\n( see here and\nhere\nfor an example).","title":"Matrix building in scripted pipeline","tags":["matrix","pipeline","plugins","scripted"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/bf8e1/sgleske.png","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/914ee/sgleske.png 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/1c9ce/sgleske.png 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/bf8e1/sgleske.png 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/acb7c/sgleske.png 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/ef6ff/sgleske.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/8257c/sgleske.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/6766a/sgleske.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/383551e873ffc7c72da8547e3d05f878/22bfc/sgleske.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"samrocketman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A Senior Software Engineer at <a href=\"https://integralads.com/\">Integral Ad\nScience</a>, he develops a Jenkins solution to scale CI/CD onboarding for the\nentire company.

Each exclude has one or more axis directives with name and values.\nThe axis directives inside an exclude generate a set of combinations (similar to generating the matrix cells).\nThe matrix cells that match all the values from an exclude combination are removed from the matrix.\nIf I have more than one exclude directive, each are evaluated separately to remove cells.\n\nWhen dealing with a long lists of values to exclude, I can use notValues instead of values to specify axis values we don’t want excluded.\nYes, that’s a double negative, so it can get a little confusing.\nI try to use it only when I really need it.\n\nIn my sample pipeline below, I specifically exclude the linux, safari combination and I also exclude any platform that is not windows with the edge browser.\n\nThis pipeline uses two axes but there is no limit on the number of axis directives.\n\nAlso, in this pipeline each exclude specifies values for both axes, but that is not required.\nIf we wanted to run only \"linux\" cells, we could use the following exclude :\n\nexclude {\n    axis {\n        name 'PLATFORM'\n        notValues 'linux'\n    }\n}\n\npipeline {\n    agent none\n    stages {\n        stage('BuildAndTest') {\n            matrix {\n                agent any\n                axes {\n                    axis {\n                        name 'PLATFORM'\n                        values 'linux', 'windows', 'mac'\n                    }\n                    axis {\n                        name 'BROWSER'\n                        values 'firefox', 'chrome', 'safari', 'edge'\n                    }\n                }\n                excludes {\n                    exclude {\n                        axis {\n                            name 'PLATFORM'\n                            values 'linux'\n                        }\n                        axis {\n                            name 'BROWSER'\n                            values 'safari'\n                        }\n                    }\n                    exclude {\n                        axis {\n                            name 'PLATFORM'\n                            notValues 'windows'\n                        }\n                        axis {\n                            name 'BROWSER'\n                            values 'edge'\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                stages {\n                    stage('Build') {\n                        steps {\n                            echo \"Do Build for ${PLATFORM} -

The performance issues for Role Strategy Plugin\nhad been reported multiple times on Jenkins JIRA. With a large number of roles\nand with complex regular expressions, a large slow-down was visible on the Web UI.\nEven before GSoC started, there were a number of patches which tried to improve\nperformance of the plugin (by Deepansh Nagaria\nand others).\n\nAt the time, there was no way to reliably measure improvements in performance.\nTherefore, we started by creating a\nframework\nfor running micro-benchmarks on Jenkins Plugins. Benchmarks using the framework\nwere added to the Role Strategy Plugin find performance\ncritical parts of the plugins and to measure the improvements of a change.\nThis blog post summarizes the changes that were made and performance improvements\nmeasured.\n\nCaching matching roles\n\nA couple of major changes were made to the Role Strategy Plugin to improve its\nperformance. First, we started collection of roles that matched a given\nproject name. The Role Strategy plugin before version 2.12 used to run over\nregular expressions for every role that it had for every permission checking\nrequest it got. Storing this produced set of roles in the memory provides us\nlarge improvements in performance and avoids repeated matching of project names\nwith regular expressions. For keeping the plugin working securely, we invalidate\nthe cache whenever any update is made to the roles.\n\nAfter this change, we were able to observe performance improvements of up to\n3300%. These improvements were visualized using\nJMH Visualizer.\n\nMore information is available at pull request on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/pull/81\n\nCalculating Implying Permisions when plugin is loaded\n\nJenkins' permission model allows one permissions to imply other permissions.\nWhen a permission check is made, we need to check if the user has any of\npermissions that would imply this permisison. For every permission checking\nrequest that that the Role Strategy, it used to calculate all the implying\npermissions. To avoid this, we now calculate and store implying permissions\nfor every permission in the Jenkins system when the plugin gets loaded.\n\nAfter both of these changes, we were able to experience improvements of up to\n10000%. The benchmark results show it better:\n\nMore information about this change can be found at the GitHub pull request:\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/pull/83\n\nBoth of these changes were integrated into the Role Strategy Plugin and the\nimprovements can be experienced starting with version\n2.13.\n\nBonus: Configuration-as-Code export now works for Role Strategy\n\nWith Configuration-as-Code plugin version\n1.24\nand above, export of your configuration as YAML now works!\n\nAs an alternative to\nRole Strategy Plugin, I also created the brand new Folder Authorization Plugin.\nYou can check out the blog post for\nmore information about the plugin.\n\nLinks and Feedback\n\nI would love to hear your comments and suggestions.

The Working Hours Plugin repository can be found at Working Hours Plugin.\n\nOverview\n\nDeveloping plugin for Jenkins has always been easy to do with its Jelly based UI render system, but Jelly seems to be pretty heavy when we want to use more modernized frameworks like React, or if we need to make the plugin UI more customized. This is what this template is built for.\n\nAnd with React integrated, development of Jenkins plugin is more modernized, developer can now use tons of React libraries, the way to use libraries is now tinier and safer with webpack, in short, coding with Jenkins plugin can be much easier.\n\nFeatures\n\nFeature\nSummary\n\nReact Integrated\nReact is integrated, you can take full control of the UI\n\nUsing Iframe\nUsing iframe can create a new javascript env, we can get rid of some side effects of some polyfills which was added globally.(such as Prototype.js)\n\nMaven Lifecycle\nnpm commands are integrated into Maven lifecycle with help of Frontend Maven Plugin\n\nWebpack\nWebpack helps us reduce the size of the bundle, also avoids pollution on the global namespace.\n\nJenkins Crumb attached\nCrumb is attached to Axios client, now you can send requests in the way you used to do in React.\n\nExpress as devserver\nYou can run your react app in a standalone page so you can develop in webpack hot reload mode, also with webpack proxy, the standalone app is still accessible to the jenkins dev server.\n\nAxios as http client\nAxios hugely simplify the way to make requests.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExample Plugin UI\n\nManagement Link\n\nGetting Started\n\nClone the repo:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/react-plugin-template.git\ncd react-plugin-template\n\nInstall the Maven dependencies and node modules.\n\nmvn install -DskipTests\n\nRun standalone React app with hot reload\n\nnpm run start\n\nRun plugin\n\nmvn hpi:run -Dskip.npm -f pom.xml\n\nSend HTTP requests\n\nAs Crumb Issuer is default enabled in Jenkins and each ajax request is required to contain a Jenkins Crumb in request header, so be sure to use the axiosInstance which is already set up with Jenkins Crumb and exported at src/main/react/app/api.js.\n\nexport const apiGetData = () => {\n  return axiosInstance.post(\"/data\");\n};\n\nOr if you want to use your own http client, remember to add the Jenkins Crumb to your request’s header, the Crumb’s key and content could be found at src/main/react/app/utils/urlConfig.js, then you can set the header like below.\n\nconst headers = {};\nconst crumbHeaderName = UrlConfig.getCrumbHeaderName();\n\nif (crumbHeaderName) {\n  headers[crumbHeaderName] = UrlConfig.getCrumbToken();\n}\n\nWrite your own request handler\n\nNow you can customize your request pattern as you want, also we need to write a handler.\n\nJenkins is using stapler to preprocess the requests, so if you need a request handler. For example and also in this template, you can use an Action class to create a sub-url, and then a StaplerProxy to proxy the request like a router. More info about handlers can be found in the Stapler Reference.\n\nExample handler\n\nManagementLink would get the request and then hand it off to the PluginUI\n\n@Extension\npublic class PluginManagementLink extends ManagementLink implements StaplerProxy {\n\n    PluginUI webapp;\n\n    public Object getTarget() {\n        return webapp;\n    }\n\n    public String getUrlName() {\n        return \"react-plugin-template\";\n    }\n}\n\nPluginUI, stapler would then find methods in the target class, in this case, it finds doDynamic, then we can choose the next handler by return the methods result, in this case, getTodos or setTodos, and PluginUI just function like a url router.\n\npublic class PluginUI{\n    public HttpResponse doDynamic(StaplerRequest request) {\n        ...\n\n        List params = getRequestParams(request);\n\n        switch (params.get(0)) {\n        case \"get-todos\":\n            return getTodos();\n        case \"set-todos\":\n            return setTodos(request);\n        }\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nData Persistence\n\nYou can save your data with a descriptor\n\n@Extension\npublic class PluginConfig extends Descriptor implements Describable\n\nAnd after each time you change data, call save() to persist them.\n\npublic void setTodos(\n            @CheckForNull List value) {\n        this.todos = value;\n        save();\n    }\n\nAnd in your handler, you can get the config class by calling\n\nconfig = ExtensionList.lookup(PluginConfig.class).get(0);\n\nCustomize your plugin\n\nBe sure to modify all the occurrence of react-template\n\nAt org/jenkinsci/plugins/reactplugintemplate/PluginUI/index.jelly, change the iframe’s id and its source url.\n\nAt src/main/react/app/utils/urlConfig.js change\n\nAt src/main/react/server/config.js, change the proxy route.\n\nAt src/main/react/package.json, change the start script’s BASE_URL\n\nAt pom.xml, change the artifactId\n\nAt org/jenkinsci/plugins/reactplugintemplate/PluginManagementLink.java, change names.\n\nAlso use the same value to modify the occurrence in src\\main\\react\\app\\utils\\urlConfig.js.\n\nCustomize a page for your plugin\n\nA management Link is recommended, which would get your plugin a standalone page, along with a entry button in the /manage system manage page.\n\nHow does this template work?\n\nThis template is putting a webpack project inside a Maven project, and this template is just chaining the build result by copy the webpack output to the plugin’s webapp folder to make it accessible from the iframe, then Jelly render the iframe and the client gets the Plugin UI.\n\nWhy iframe?\n\nOver time, Jenkins has added a lot of various javascript libraries to every regular page, which now causes problems for using modern Javascript tooling and as such, we decided to inline the new react based pages in their own sandbox which prevents collisions with other libraries, and maybe the iframe is a good sandbox case.\n\nLinks\n\nGithub: React Plugin Template\n\nGithub: Working Hours Plugin","title":"Introduce React Plugin Template","tags":["react","plugins","template","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/77b35/jackshen.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/d4a57/jackshen.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ead9a/jackshen.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/14734/jackshen.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/ef6ff/jackshen.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/8257c/jackshen.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/f4bd7/jackshen.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/62225dd22671b80390a05776aec4c23b/65cd2/jackshen.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":129}}},"blog":null,"github":"ShenJack","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Shen is a student from Beijing Forestry University.
