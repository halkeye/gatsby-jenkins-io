Who is it for? What are the highlights of your plugin?* +\n +\n\n+\nA: https://loader.io[Loader.io] is a simple-to-use cloud-based load testing service. The service is designed for developers and people who need to ensure applications are performing as they should. It allows developers to perform large-scale load tests on demand, which lets them understand the scalability and performance of their applications. We realize Jenkins is the preferred build service for a lot of our users, and we know providing a way for them to implement, measure and improve application performance during the continuous build cycle is important. So we wrote a Jenkins plugin that allows load testing to be brought into the continuous build and deployment process with ease. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: Did you have to convince your boss/lawyers to open-source your plugin? What was the pitch?*\n\n+\nA: No, at SendGrid our focus is always to help make developers’ lives easier, and when we can, we like to provide tools that they can hack on. Since the Jenkins platform is itself an open source project, following the same model to provide our plugin made perfect sense. In addition, we encourage others to build on our work, help improve it and ultimately make it better for everyone using it. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: How did you learn how to write a plugin?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: We use the Jenkins platform ourselves, and we leverage a number of the plugins available. Having access to these and the Jenkins documentation gave us a great head start. It was an easy decision to write the Jenkins plugin for loader.io, and the Jenkins community provided both detailed instructions as well as support when we needed it. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: Any gotchas in the experience of developing a plugin that you want to share?\n\n*\n\n+\nA: The overall process of developing the plugin was straightforward and simple, but we did run into some scope creep in the middle of the dev process. We found that since the platform was so easy to write for, it made us keep adding more and more features. Usually this is good, but in the case of our project, we wanted to provide the most value as quickly as possible. So we scaled back, focused on solid execution for the most important features, and are already preparing to launch a new version with the things we reserved for post v1 availability. +\n +\n +\n\n+\nQ: What is the reaction from users so far?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: The users we’ve spoken with love the plugin. In addition we’ve already gotten great feedback from some community members on “nice to have’s” in the plugin, some of which we’re already working on. +\n +\n\n+\nQ: What tips do you share to those who are interested in writing plugins?\n\n+\n+\n\n+\nA: If you have a service that provides value in the build, deployment and post deployment process, then you should be writing a Jenkins plugin. Two things are important for anyone writing a plugin: 1) be sure the plugin you’re writing is going to provide true value (if you need it yourself this is a good sign), and 2) make sure you understand the scope of the project and deliver core features and value first, then focus on some extra things. Providing a valuable plugin sooner than later will help you identify all the right additional features to include, especially when collecting live community feedback. +\n +\n\n+\nSome of the things we focused on early in the process were to identify the core features, and more importantly to make it very easy for users of Jenkins to install, use and interpret the loader.io plugin and results. We wanted to allow users to leverage our plugin for multiple environments and builds with system and global credentials. To do this, we decided to make use of the Credentials plugin (https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin), which is a heavily-adopted plugin that provides a standardized API for plugins to store and retrieve credentials. This plugin allows our users to add and use different credentials in one single Jenkins environment. In addition, we created a new re-run feature which, when used with continuous build and testing, provides a deep view into the performance of an application over time. Finally, we wanted to bring the same UI experience users have in our environment into Jenkins, which we did by preserving the load test report model and making it function the same in the Jenkins UI. Doing this makes it easy for users to have consistency between the UIs and more easily understand the results regardless of where they’re viewing them. +\n +\n\n+\nIt’s very easy to write a Jenkins plugin - I hope these insights will encourage you to write your own. +\n +\n\n+\nps - We’d love your feedback too.

Combine that with the fact that there are so many different ways to use Git, it was inevitable that Git plugin became quite a capable but complex plugin over time. It has more than a dozen options and switches, and it was becoming harder to use and harder to maintain.\n\nAs early as 2010, some of us have already been saying that we should refactor this plugin, but none of us have managed. The good news is, I finally started tackling this problem last month while I was in London, and I’ve made a steadily progress since then and I’m ready for a wider review.\n\nSo we’ll spend this Wednesday going over the changes. I’ll show you how the new version looks, what changes are made internally, and what it’ll enable us in the future.\n\nIf the Git plugin is important to you, and you want to see what’s cooking, please join us in the office hours on Google Hangout.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you!","title":"Office hours this week: Git plugin refactoring","tags":["development","plugins"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2013-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","id":"24926dd2-b6f9-5057-9f68-59a583212c04","slug":"/blog/2013/06/21/reducing-the-of-threads-in-jenkins-ssh-slaves/","strippedHtml":"+\nAs the usage of Jenkins expands, we started seeing users who run multiple 100s of agents on one controller, and thus it became a lot more important for us to scale well to even larger number of agents. +\n +\n\n+\nWhile I was looking at the thread dump of a large system, I started noticing that there are a large number of threads lying around pumping `+InputStream+` and writing to another `+OutputStream+`. On Linux, each thread occupies 2MB just for its stack size, so if we can eliminate some of them, it'd be a good saving. +\n +\n\n+\nSo this morning, I tackled one source of such waste. +\n +\n\n+\nJenkins has https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin[the ability to launch agent on a remote server via SSH] for the longest time, and to simplify this, we've been using a https://github.com/jenkinsci/trilead-ssh2[pure-Java implementation of SSH client]. +\n +\n\n+\nTo cut the long story short, I was able to eliminate two pump threads per every SSH connection. Furthermore, when it runs on the upcoming Jenkins 1.521, it'll save one more thread per every SSH connection. So if you have 100 agents connected through SSH, this alone saves up 600MB of memory. That's pretty good for a few hours work! +\n +\n\n+\nIf you run a lot of agents, be sure to pick up version 0.27 of https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin[the SSH agents plugin] to take advantages of this! +","title":"Reducing the # of threads in Jenkins: SSH agents","tags":["development","news","plugins","releases"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/f81fe/kohsuke.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/01b1b/kohsuke.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/edb43/kohsuke.jpg 128w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/035c3/kohsuke.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/273f8/kohsuke.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/dd191cfa3b1158515bff16d455e6117b/e3840/kohsuke.webp 128w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":148}}},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"/blog/authors/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2012-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","id":"18a1c49c-f61d-53b6-b0ae-88d9b4ed9f31","slug":"/blog/2012/12/13/office-hours-next-week-metadata-plugin/","strippedHtml":"+\nhttps://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours[The last Jenkins office hour of the year] hosts Robert Sandell and Tomas Westling, who will go over https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Metadata+plugin[newly open-sourced metadata plugin] from Sony Mobile Communications (https://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/11/22/sony-contributes-to-jenkins-software-tool/[more about this story on their website]).

A journey that started over a year ago by Charles Lowell has reached a new level, thanks to lots of help from Kohsuke along with Hiroshi Nakamura and Jørgen Tjernø.\n\nAs of today, with Jenkins 1.438, you can now download and install Ruby plugins from the update center (the Path Ignore plugin being the first).\n\nWords simply can’t express what a monumental achievement this is for the Jenkins project, both from the technical perspective but also in terms of what this means for the future of the project.\n\nAccording to the languages dashboard on GitHub, Ruby is over two times as popular as Java on the site.

If you’re looking for a reference project, this is currently the most up-to-date plugin.\n\nThere is also a wiki page covering Ruby plugin development , which might be a little out-of-date but covers most of the essentials.\n\nAdditionally you might find the jenkins-prototype-plugin an interesting resource as it is practically a kitchen sink of demo/test Ruby plugin code.\n\nCurrently only a few extension points (BuildStep, Publisher, BuildWrapper) are mapped in a Ruby-friendly manner. Don’t let that scare you though! If you dig around in the jenkins-plugin-runtime you can see how the existing extension points are mapped from Java into Ruby, because Ruby plugins are running under JRuby, if you need to access some Java APIs, you can do so without too much trouble.\n\nThe Thank Yous\n\nGreat efforts like this one don’t just happen without support, which is why I’d like to call out and thank The FrontSide for their wonderful support, helping to cover costs of WebEx for Office Hours and covering Charles' time while he worked with Kohsuke on the internal plumbing needed to make Ruby plugins possible within Jenkins core.
