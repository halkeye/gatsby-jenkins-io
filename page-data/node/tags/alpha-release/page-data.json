You can check the CHANGELOG to see the features included in this initial release.\n\nOverview\n\nCurrent versions of Jenkins Remoting are based on the TCP protocol. If it fails, the agent connection and the build fails as well. There are also issues with traffic prioritization and multi-agent communications, which impact Jenkins stability and scalability.\n\nRemoting Kafka Plugin is a plugin developed under Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2018. The plugin is developed to add support of a popular message queue/bus technology (Kafka) as a fault-tolerant communication layer in Jenkins. A quick introduction of the project can be found in this introduction blogpost.\n\nHow to use the plugin?\n\nThe instructions to run the plugin in alpha version are written here. Feel free to have a try and let us know your feedback on Gitter or the mailing list.\n\nLinks\n\nAlpha Changelog\n\nIntroduction Blogpost\n\nGitHub Repository\n\nProject Page\n\nPhase 1 Presentation Video\n\nPhase 1 Presentation Slides","title":"GSoC Project Update: Alpha release of Remoting Kafka Plugin","tags":["plugins","gsoc","gsoc2018","remoting","alpha-release"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"alpha-release","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
