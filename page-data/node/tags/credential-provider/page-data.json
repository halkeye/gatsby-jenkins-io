1) // shows the right secret was loaded, don't do this for real secrets unless you're debugging\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Scripted //\nwithCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'secret-key', variable: 'SECRET_KEY')]) {\n    echo SECRET_KEY\n    echo SECRET_KEY.substring(0, SECRET_KEY.size() - 1) // shows the right secret was loaded, don't do this for real secrets unless you're debugging\n}\n\nYou have now successfully retrieved a credential from Azure Key Vault using native Jenkins credentials integration.\n\nconfiguration-as-code integration\n\nThe Configuration as Code plugin has been designed as an opinionated way to configure Jenkins based on human-readable declarative configuration files. Writing such a file should be easy without being a Jenkins expert.\n\nFor many secrets the credential provider is enough,\nbut when integrating with other plugins you will likely need more than string credentials.\n\nYou can use the configuration-as-code plugin (aka JCasC) to allow integrating with other credential types.\n\nconfigure authentication\n\nAs the JCasC plugin runs during initial startup the Azure Key Vault credential provider needs to be configured before JCasC runs during startup.\n\nThe easiest way to do that is via environment variables set before Jenkins starts up:\n\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_URL=https://my.vault.azure.net\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_CLIENT_ID=...\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_CLIENT_SECRET=...\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=...\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=...\n\nSee the azure-keyvault documentation for other authentication options.\n\nYou will now be able to refer to Azure Key Vault secret IDs in your jenkins.yaml file:\n\ncredentials:\n  system:\n    domainCredentials:\n      - credentials:\n        - usernamePassword:\n            description: \"GitHub\"\n            id: \"jenkins-github\"\n            password: \"${jenkins-github-apikey}\"\n            scope: GLOBAL\n            username: \"jenkinsadmin\"\n\nThanks for reading, send feedback on twitter using the tweet button in the top right, any issues or feature requests use GitHub issues.","title":"Introducing the Azure Key Vault Credentials Provider for Jenkins","tags":["jenkins","pipeline","security","azure","credentials","credential-provider","configuration-as-code"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"credential-provider","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
