Tyler Croy, who is a\nlong-time contributor to Jenkins and the primary contact for Jenkins project\ninfrastructure. He is also a Jenkins Evangelist at\nCloudBees, Inc.\n\nWhen the Ruby on Rails framework debuted it\nchanged the industry in two noteworthy ways: it created a trend of opinionated web\napplication frameworks ( Django,\nPlay, Grails) and it\nalso strongly encouraged thousands of developers to embrace test-driven\ndevelopment along with many other modern best practices (source control, dependency\nmanagement, etc). Because Ruby, the language underneath Rails, is interpreted\ninstead of compiled there isn’t a \"build\" per se but rather tens, if not\nhundreds, of tests, linters and scans which are run to ensure the application’s\nquality. With the rise in popularity of Rails, the popularity of application\nhosting services with easy-to-use deployment tools like Heroku or\nEngine Yard rose too.\n\nThis combination of good test coverage and easily automated deployments\nmakes Rails easy to continuously deliver with Jenkins. In this post we’ll cover\ntesting non-trivial Rails applications with Jenkins\nPipeline and, as an added bonus, we will add security scanning via\nBrakeman and the\nBrakeman\nplugin.\n\nTopics\n\nPreparing the app\n\nPreparing Jenkins\n\nWriting the Pipeline\n\nSecurity scanning\n\nDeploying the good stuff\n\nWrap up\n\nFor this demonstration, I used Ruby Central 's\ncfp-app :\n\nA Ruby on Rails application that lets you manage your conference’s call for\nproposal (CFP), program and schedule. It was written by Ruby Central to run the\nCFPs for RailsConf and RubyConf.\n\nI chose this Rails app, not only because it’s a sizable application with lots\nof tests, but it’s actually the application we used to collect talk proposals\nfor the \" Community Tracks\" at this\nyear’s Jenkins World. For the most part,\ncfp-app is a standard Rails application. It uses\nPostgreSQL for its database,\nRSpec for its tests and\nRuby 2.3.x as its runtime.\n\nIf you prefer to just to look at the code, skip straight to the\nJenkinsfile.\n\nPreparing the app\n\nFor most Rails applications there are few, if any, changes needed to enable\ncontinuous delivery with Jenkins. In the case of\ncfp-app, I added two gems to get\nthe most optimal integration into Jenkins:\n\nci_reporter, for test report\nintegration\n\nbrakeman, for security scanning.\n\nAdding these was simple, I just needed to update the Gemfile and the\nRakefile in the root of the repository to contain:\n\nGemfile\n\n# .. snip ..\ngroup :test do\n  # RSpec, etc\n  gem 'ci_reporter'\n  gem 'ci_reporter_rspec'\n  gem \"brakeman\", :require => false\nend\n\nRakefile\n\n# .. snip ..\nrequire 'ci/reporter/rake/rspec'\n# Make sure we setup ci_reporter before executing our RSpec examples\ntask :spec => 'ci:setup:rspec'\n\nPreparing Jenkins\n\nWith the cfp-app project set up, next on the list is to ensure that Jenkins itself\nis ready. Generally I suggest running the latest LTS of\nJenkins; for this demonstration I used Jenkins 2.7.1 with the following\nplugins:\n\nPipeline plugin\n\nBrakeman plugin\n\nCloudBees\nDocker Pipeline plugin\n\nI also used the\nGitHub\nOrganization Folder plugin to automatically create pipeline items in my\nJenkins instance; that isn’t required for the demo, but it’s pretty cool to see\nrepositories and branches with a Jenkinsfile automatically show up in\nJenkins, so I recommend it!\n\nIn addition to the plugins listed above, I also needed at least one\nJenkins agent with the Docker daemon installed and\nrunning on it. I label these agents with \"docker\" to make it easier to assign\nDocker-based workloads to them in the future.\n\nAny Linux-based machine with Docker installed will work, in my case I was\nprovisioning on-demand agents with the\nAzure\nplugin which, like the\nEC2 plugin,\nhelps keep my test costs down.\n\nIf you’re using Amazon Web Services, you might also be interested in\nthis blog post from\nearlier this year unveiling the\nEC2\nFleet plugin for working with EC2 Spot Fleets.\n\nWriting the Pipeline\n\nTo make sense of the various things that the Jenkinsfile needs to do, I find\nit easier to start by simply defining the stages of my pipeline. This helps me\nthink of, in broad terms, what order of operations my pipeline should have.\nFor example:\n\n/* Assign our work to an agent labelled 'docker' */\nnode('docker') {\n    stage 'Prepare Container'\n    stage 'Install Gems'\n    stage 'Prepare Database'\n    stage 'Invoke Rake'\n    stage 'Security scan'\n    stage 'Deploy'\n}\n\nAs mentioned previously, this Jenkinsfile is going to rely heavily on the\nCloudBees\nDocker Pipeline plugin. The plugin provides two very important features:\n\nAbility to execute steps inside of a running Docker container\n\nAbility to run a container in the \"background.\"\n\nLike most Rails applications, one can effectively test the application with two\ncommands: bundle install followed by bundle exec rake. I already had some\nDocker images prepared with RVM and Ruby 2.3.0 installed,\nwhich ensures a common and consistent starting point:\n\nnode('docker') {\n    // .. 'stage' steps removed\n    docker.image('rtyler/rvm:2.3.0').inside { (1)\nrvm 'bundle install' (2)\nrvm 'bundle exec rake'\n    } (3)\n}\n\n1\nRun the named container. The inside method can take optional additional flags for the docker run command.\n\n2\nExecute our shell commands using our tiny sh step wrapper\nrvm . This ensures that the shell code is executed in the correct RVM environment.\n\n3\nWhen the closure completes, the container will be destroyed.\n\nUnfortunately, with this application, the bundle exec rake command will fail\nif PostgreSQL isn’t available when the process starts. This is where the\nsecond important feature of the CloudBees Docker Pipeline plugin comes\ninto effect: the ability to run a container in the \"background.\"\n\nnode('docker') {\n    // .. 'stage' steps removed\n    /* Pull the latest `postgres` container and run it in the background */\n    docker.image('postgres').withRun { container -> (1)\necho \"PostgreSQL running in container ${container.id}\" (2)\n} (3)\n}\n\n1\nRun the container, effectively docker run postgres\n\n2\nAny number of steps can go inside the closure\n\n3\nWhen the closure completes, the container will be destroyed.\n\nRunning the tests\n\nCombining these two snippets of Jenkins Pipeline is, in my opinion, where the\npower of the DSL\nshines:\n\nnode('docker') {\n    docker.image('postgres').withRun { container ->\n        docker.image('rtyler/rvm:2.3.0').inside(\"--link=${container.id}:postgres\") { (1)\nstage 'Install Gems'\n            rvm \"bundle install\"\n\n            stage 'Invoke Rake'\n            withEnv(['DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@postgres:5432/']) { (2)\nrvm \"bundle exec rake\"\n            }\n            junit 'spec/reports/*.xml' (3)\n}\n    }\n}\n\n1\nBy passing the --link argument, the Docker daemon will allow the RVM container to talk to the PostgreSQL container under the host name 'postgres'.\n\n2\nUse the withEnv step to set environment variables for everything that is in the closure. In this case, the cfp-app DB scaffolding will look for the DATABASE_URL variable to override the DB host/user/dbname defaults.\n\n3\nArchive the test reports generated by ci_reporter so that Jenkins can display test reports and trend analysis.\n\nWith this done, the basics are in place to consistently run the tests for\ncfp-app in fresh Docker containers for each execution of the pipeline.\n\nSecurity scanning\n\nUsing Brakeman, the security scanner for Ruby\non Rails, is almost trivially easy inside of Jenkins Pipeline, thanks to the\nBrakeman\nplugin which implements the publishBrakeman step.\n\nBuilding off our example above, we can implement the \"Security scan\" stage:\n\nnode('docker') {\n    /* --8 (1)\npublishBrakeman 'brakeman-output.tabs' (2)\n/* --8\n\n1\nRun the Brakeman security scanner for Rails and store the output for later in brakeman-output.tabs\n\n2\nArchive the reports generated by Brakeman so that Jenkins can display detailed reports with trend analysis.\n\nAs of this writing, there is work in progress\n( JENKINS-31202) to\nrender trend graphs from plugins like Brakeman on a pipeline project’s main\npage.\n\nDeploying the good stuff\n\nOnce the tests and security scanning are all working properly, we can start to\nset up the deployment stage. Jenkins Pipeline provides the variable\ncurrentBuild which we can use to determine whether our pipeline has been\nsuccessful thus far or not. This allows us to add the logic to only deploy when\neverything is passing, as we would expect:\n\nnode('docker') {\n    /* --8 (1)\nsh './deploy.sh' (2)\n}\n    else {\n        mail subject: \"Something is wrong with ${env.JOB_NAME} ${env.BUILD_ID}\",\n                  to: 'nobody@example.com',\n                body: 'You should fix it'\n    }\n    /* --8\n\n1\ncurrentBuild has the result property which would be 'SUCCESS', 'FAILED', 'UNSTABLE', 'ABORTED'\n\n2\nOnly if currentBuild.result is successful should we bother invoking our deployment script (e.g. git push heroku master)\n\nWrap up\n\nI have gratuitously commented the full\nJenkinsfile\nwhich I hope is a useful summation of the work outlined above. Having worked\non a number of Rails applications in the past, the consistency provided by\nDocker and Jenkins Pipeline above would have definitely improved those\nprojects' delivery times. There is still room for improvement however, which\nis left as an exercise for the reader. Such as: preparing new containers with\nall their\ndependencies\nbuilt-in instead of installing them at run-time. Or utilizing the parallel\nstep for executing RSpec across multiple Jenkins agents simultaneously.\n\nThe beautiful thing about defining your continuous delivery, and continuous\nsecurity, pipeline in code is that you can continue to iterate on it!","title":"Continuous Security for Rails apps with Pipeline and Brakeman","tags":["tutorial","ruby","pipeline","rails","brakeman","continuousdelivery"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/rtyler.jpeg"},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
