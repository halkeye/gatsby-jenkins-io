critical security vulnerability has been identified in the popular \"Apache Log4j 2\" library.\nThis vulnerability is identified as CVE-2021-44228.\n\nLog4j in Jenkins\n\nThe Jenkins security team has confirmed that Log4j is not used in Jenkins core.\nJenkins plugins may be using Log4j.\nYou can identify whether Log4j is included with any plugin by running the following Groovy script in the Script Console :\n\norg.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup.class.protectionDomain.codeSource\n\nIf this results in the following error, Log4j is not included in any installed and enabled plugin:\n\ngroovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: org for class: Script1\n\nOtherwise, the script output will print one location where Log4j is found, which includes the plugin name in the path.\nThat plugin should be disabled or uninstalled, followed by a Jenkins restart and another script execution until the \"No such property\" error appears.\n\nAffected plugins and their mitigation status are listed in the Jenkins issue tracker.\nSee this Jira Epic for components known to be affected.\n\nLog4j in web application containers\n\nIf you are hosting your Jenkins in a separate web application container like Tomcat, Websphere, or Glassfish, check with the providers of those containers to assess if they are using a vulnerable version of Log4j.\n\nWhen Jenkins runs from the Docker image, a native installer package (deb, rpm, msi), or is invoked with java -jar jenkins.war, it is not running inside a separate web application container.\nIt is using the built-in Jetty web application container that is bundled inside Jenkins and does not include Log4j.\n\nLog4j in Jenkins project infrastructure\n\nThe Jenkins infrastructure team is currently checking all Jenkins project infrastructure for the presence of vulnerable versions of the Log4j library.\nThis work is ongoing.\nWe may decide to disable some services temporarily out of an abundance of caution.\nYou can see the status of services on the status page.","title":"Apache Log4j 2 vulnerability

this week the Jenkins infrastructure team identified a successful attack against our deprecated Confluence service.\nWe responded immediately by taking the affected server offline while we investigated the potential impact.\nAt this time we have no reason to believe that any Jenkins releases, plugins, or source code have been affected.\n\nThus far in our investigation, we have learned that the Confluence CVE-2021-26084 exploit was used to install what we believe was a Monero miner in the container running the service.\nFrom there an attacker would not be able to access much of our other infrastructure.\nConfluence did integrate with our integrated identity system which also powers Jira, Artifactory, and numerous other services.\n\nThe trust and security in Jenkins core and plugin releases is our highest priority.\nWe do not have any indication that developer credentials were exfiltrated during the attack.\nAt the moment we cannot assert otherwise and are therefore assuming the worst.\nWe are taking actions to prevent releases at this time until we re-establish a chain of trust with our developer community.\nWe have reset passwords for all accounts in our integrated identity system.\nWe are improving the password reset system as part of this effort.\n\nAt this time, the Jenkins infrastructure team has permanently disabled the Confluence service, rotated privileged credentials, and taken proactive measures to further reduce the scope of access across our infrastructure.\nWe are working closely with our colleagues at the Linux Foundation and the Continuous Delivery Foundation to ensure that infrastructure which is not directly managed by the Jenkins project is also scrutinized.\n\nIn October 2019 we made the Confluence server read-only effectively deprecating it for day-to-day use within the project.\nAt that time, we began migrating documentation and changelogs from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\nThat migration has been ongoing, with hundreds of plugins and many other documentation pages moved from the wiki to GitHub repositories.\n\nWe are grateful for those of you who followed our responsible disclosure procedure and reached out to us about this vulnerability affecting the Jenkins project.\n\nWe will continue to take proactive measures to improve the security of our infrastructure and encourage you to follow us on Twitter for further updates.","title":"Jenkins project Confluence instance

Thus, Jetstack/cert-manager is used to provision TLS certificates and establish connection between Kubernetes API and webhook.\n\nImplementaion\n\nOperator-SDK takes care of creating a new webhook and appending it to the manager and creating handlers.\nTls certificates are managed using cert-manager.\n\nValidation Logic:\n\nProposed Implementations: Iterate through the list of plugins to be installed and fetch warnings for each plugin from the plugin center API and check if the version of that plugin has any of those warnings.\n\nCaveats: Webhooks add latency to an API request, hence they should evaluate as quickly as possible thus having max allowed timeout of 30s. In the earlier approach I was fetching the security warnings from the plugin site API in the validator interface itself, and since network operations are slow, it was causing a timeout in the case of validating a larger number of plugins or when the Internet connection was not good.\n\nUpdated Implementaion: Instead of fetching information for each plugin, the information about all the plugins is downloaded and cached at the start of the operator and updated periodically, thus eliminating network calls and finishing validation in less than a second.\n\nEvaluation Phase 1:\n\nScaffoled a new validation webhook\n\nAdded manifests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, certificates and volumes, and updated Makefile\n\nImplemented the validator interface\n\nUpdated helm charts\n\nEvaluation Phase 2:\n\nReimplemented the validator interface.\n\nAdded unit tests for internal functions\n\nAdded e2e tests along with helm tests\n\nUpdated helm charts\n\nResources\n\nPull Requests\n\nAdded validation webhook,manifests,and updated Makefile\n\nImplemented validation logic,added tests and updated helm charts\n\nPhase 1 demo\n\nUser Guide\n\nThe webhook feature is completely optional for the user. It can be easily deployed using Helm Chart by setting webhook.enabled in values.yaml and in the Operator command line flag.\n\nwebhook.enabled=true\n\nTo enable security validation in the jenkins custom resource set\n\njenkins.ValidateSecurityWarnings=true\n\nNote: The webhook takes some time to get up and running, also when helm renders the template, the validating webhook configuration is applied last, hence if the user wants to deploy the Jenkins Custom Resource with validation turned on, he needs to wait for some time. After the webhook is up and running the user can deploy the Jenkins Custom Resource using helm or kubectl\n\nFuture work\n\nImplementing a post-install hook in the helm charts that checks whether the webhook is up and running.\n\nAdding validation for required core version of plugin and core version of Jenkins.\n\nMigrating other validation logic from controller to the webhook.\n\nAdding validation for the dependencies of the plugins.","title":"Security Validator for Jenkins Operator for

is a CI/CD solution and as such, it is critical that the open source plugins that constitute an integral part of it don’t expose the systems they are used on to any security risks and vulnerabilities.\nIt is in that context that we worked as an audit/code review team to track and report such flaws and problematic practices.\n\nWe worked in collaboration with Jenkins Security team member Wadeck Follonier, as part of an end-of-study project during our last year of the Master’s Degree - Reliability and IT Security in the university of Aix-Marseille.\n\nProject Goals\n\nThe main goal of this project was to allow us to discover and work on diverse security vulnerabilities in the context of a widely-used software solution, and in order to achieve that we had to separate the project in multiple other goals:\n\nLearning about some of the most common vulnerabilities and the form in which they can be found on a Jenkins Instance and its plugins.\n\nPerforming code review and technical audit on the application, and compiling our results as part of a security team.\n\nReporting our findings to the Jenkins team and the plugin maintainers, while sometimes helping the latter to correct these vulnerabilities.\n\nKnowledge Sharing\n\nAt the beginning of the project, we set up communication channels with our mentor through Slack and Google Meets, and agreed to schedule weekly sessions with him.\nThe goal of these sessions was both to teach us more about the functionalities of Jenkins and the types of vulnerabilities we would encounter, and to allow us to ask more specific questions regarding our findings.\n\nThanks to our mentor developing a mock plugin compiling a variety of classic vulnerabilities and several of their implementations, including server side request forgery ( SSRF), cross site scripting ( XSS), and XML external entity ( XXE) attacks, we have been able to learn through practice.\nIt allowed us to analyze the context of the code and the different ways the Jelly framework can be used to display information, expanding our payload options and giving us a clearer view of the patterns to look for during our code reviews.\n\nWe have also had the opportunity to learn about the process used to report the vulnerabilities to the maintainers through Jira issues, and some ways we could correct them or provide steps to do so.\n\nSearching and compiling\n\nAt first, we decided to work as a pretty loose team, with each member working on a different plugin and regrouping our findings to confirm or reject them, while staying in constant contact to ask each other questions.\nThis allowed us to broaden the scope of our searches, and is the reason why we have been able to find a larger number of vulnerabilities, in plugins that differed widely in popularity, than we would have working together from the start.\n\nWe used a single file to compile the plugins we audited and our findings, making it easier for our mentor to review them and give us feedback.\nPinpointing the specific portion of code causing the issue and providing reproduction steps as clear as we could proved useful for the reporting process, thus making the approval and correction faster.\n\nDuring the last third of this project, we began to work together on bigger plugins, in order to have more points of view reflecting on the same problem.\nWith different analyses, we were able to come up with new payloads, and sometimes with new vulnerabilities where we only found one separately.\n\nReporting and correcting the vulnerabilities\n\nAll of the reporting was done through Jira issues, which allows the Jenkins team to centralize and triage the vulnerabilities.\nOnce we provided the necessary information, along with the reproduction steps we had, a member of the Jenkins security team contacted the plugin maintainer and guided them through the next steps of the process, with hope that they would answer.\n\nWe have also tried to make the maintainers' job easier, working on some fixes.\nTo achieve this, we delved not only into the functionalities of the vulnerable plugins, but also into some mitigation processes that we found either in the Jenkins documentation,  or with the help of our mentor.\n\nEach one of our modifications has been tested locally, in order to assess whether the vulnerability was still present, and whether no function had been altered.\nHowever, some of the plugins we audited demanded more complex fixes, due to their intrinsic logic, or the thought process of their developer, which led to us being unable to provide a clear fix.\n\nConsidering this, the fixes we have been able to bring into light were only suggestions to the maintainers, for them to use as inspiration or template, in order not to interfere with the plugin logic.\n\nConclusion\n\nThrough this project, we have been able to work as a team, delving into some of the different issues that security engineers are bound to face, and

little over a month ago, GitHub announced the general availability of its code scanning solution.\nIt’s based on CodeQL, which makes it pretty easy to write queries for it and run them using the CodeQL GitHub action, CodeQL command line tools, or on lgtm.com.\n\nMany of the security vulnerabilities discovered in Jenkins plugins are fairly similar to each other, and unfortunately they’re usually specific to Jenkins, which means existing generic tools would not be able to discover them.\nSo I decided to write CodeQL queries for Jenkins-specific issues and invited maintainers to sign their plugins up for a \"private beta\" of code scanning for these issues.\n\nToday’s security advisory is the first one that includes findings discovered through that initiative.\nAll these issues were discovered with assistance by this tooling:\n\nSECURITY-2101 in AWS Global Configuration Plugin,\n\nSECURITY-2102 and SECURITY-2103 in Kubernetes Plugin,\n\nSECURITY-2104 and SECURITY-2115 in Mercurial Plugin,\n\nSECURITY-2110 in Azure Key Vault Plugin, and\n\nSECURITY-2126 in Active Directory Plugin\n\nWhile there were of course also false positives we had to review and mark as ignored, the integration with the GitHub UI made this pretty straightforward.\nOverall I’m very happy with the results so far, especially considering how new this initiative is.\n\nInterested in making the plugin you are maintaining more secure?\nSign up now by filing an INFRA issue in the github component and list the plugin repositories you’d like to have scanned.","title":"First results from using

readers of today’s security advisory may already have noticed that we consider the cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to be 'High' severity.\nThis is a change from previous security advisories, in which similar vulnerabilities got a 'Medium' score.\n\nWe follow the guidelines of CVSS version 3.0 for the severity we assign to these issues.\nTheir examples for XSS vulnerabilities, as well as XSS vulnerabilities in other software, consider the most severe, immediate impact to be a modification of the HTML output, possibly also the extraction of the session cookie (something Jenkins prevents by declaring it to be HttpOnly).\n\nUnfortunately, this does not adequately model the impact that a successful XSS exploitation in Jenkins can have:\nJenkins administrators can perform far more sensitive actions than e.g. the admins of most content management systems could, as it is designed to allow users to execute code to build, test, and deploy their software.\nSo this kind of vulnerability, that allows attackers to do anything their victims have permission to do, in Jenkins can mean execution of arbitrary code, perhaps via the script console, if the victim has the Overall/Administer permission.\nNone of this requires chaining different actions in an attack, a well-chosen XSS payload will accomplish this.\n\nTherefore, starting today, we score XSS vulnerabilities by the highest immediate impact a successful attack can have, which is a complete system compromise if admins can be attacked.\nFor stored XSS requiring some permissions, like the ability to configure jobs, a typical score would be 8.0.\nReflected XSS, which don’t require any permissions to exploit, will usually score 8.8.","title":"Severity of cross-site scripting

Key Vault is a product for securely managing keys, secrets and certificates.\n\nI’m happy to announce two new features in the Azure Key Vault plugin:\n\na credential provider to tightly link Jenkins and Azure Key Vault.\n\nhuge thanks to Jie Shen for contributing this\n\nintegration with the configuration-as-code plugin.\n\nThese changes were released in v1.8 but make sure to run the latest version of the plugin, there has been some fixes since then.\n\nSome advantages of using the credential provider rather than your own scripts:\n\nyour Jenkins jobs consume the credentials with no knowledge of Azure Key Vault, so they stay vendor-independent.\n\nthe provider integrates with the ecosystem of existing Jenkins credential consumers, such as the Slack Notifications plugin.\n\ncredential usage is recorded in the central Jenkins credentials tracking log.\n\nJenkins can use multiple credentials providers concurrently, so you can incrementally migrate credentials to Azure Key Vault while consuming other credentials from your existing providers.\n\nNote: Currently only secret text credentials are supported via the credential provider, you can use the configuration-as-code integration to load the secret from Azure Key Vault into the System Credential Provider to work around this limitation.\n\nGetting started\n\nInstall the Azure Key Vault plugin\n\nThen you will need to configure the plugin.\n\nAzure authentication\n\nThere’s two types of authentication you can use 'Microsoft Azure Service Principal' or 'Managed Identities for Azure Resources'\n\nThe easiest one to set this up quickly with is the 'Microsoft Azure Service Principal',\n\n$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name http://service-principal-name\nCreating a role assignment under the scope of \"/subscriptions/ff251390-d7c3-4d2f-8352-f9c6f0cc8f3b\"\n  Retrying role assignment creation: 1/36\n  Retrying role assignment creation: 2/36\n{\n  \"appId\": \"021b5050-9177-4268-a300-7880f2beede3\",\n  \"displayName\": \"service-principal-name\",\n  \"name\": \"http://service-principal-name\",\n  \"password\": \"d9d0d1ba-d16f-4e85-9b48-81ea45a46448\",\n  \"tenant\": \"7e593e3e-9a1e-4c3d-a26a-b5f71de28463\"\n}\n\nIf this doesn’t work then take a look at the Microsoft documentation for creating a service principal.\n\nNote: for production 'Managed Identities for Azure Resources' is more secure as there’s no password involved and you don’t need to worry about the service principal’s password or certificate expiring.\n\nVault setup\n\nYou need to create a vault and give your service principal access to it:\n\nRESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=my-resource-group\naz group create --location uksouth --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME\n\nVAULT=my-vault # you will need a unique name for the vault\naz keyvault create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $VAULT\naz keyvault set-policy --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $VAULT \\\n  --secret-permissions get list --spn http://service-principal-name\n\nJenkins credential\n\nThe next step is to configure the credential in Jenkins:\n\nclick 'Credentials'\n\nclick 'System' (it’ll appear below the Credentials link in the side bar)\n\nclick 'Global credentials (unrestricted)'\n\nclick 'Add Credentials'\n\nselect 'Microsoft Azure Service Principal'\n\nfill out the form from the credential created above, appId is 'Client ID', password is 'Client Secret'\n\nclick 'Verify Service Principal', you should see 'Successfully verified the Microsoft Azure Service Principal'.\n\nclick 'Save'\n\nJenkins Azure Key Vault plugin configuration\n\nYou now have a credential you can use to interact with Azure resources from Jenkins, now you need to configure the plugin:\n\ngo back to the Jenkins home page\n\nclick 'Manage Jenkins'\n\nclick 'Configure System'\n\nsearch for 'Azure Key Vault Plugin'\n\nenter your vault url and select your credential\n\nclick 'Save'\n\nStore a secret in Azure Key Vault\n\nFor the step after this you will need a secret, so let’s create one now:\n\n$ az keyvault secret set --vault-name $YOUR_VAULT --name secret-key --value my-super-secret\n\nCreate a pipeline\n\nInstall the Pipeline plugin if you don’t already have it.\n\nFrom the Jenkins home page, click 'New item', and then:\n\nenter a name, i.e. 'key-vault-test'\n\nclick on 'Pipeline'\n\nadd the following to the pipeline definition:\n\n// Declarative //\npipeline {\n  agent any\n  environment {\n    SECRET_KEY = credentials('secret-key')\n  }\n  stages {\n    stage('Foo') {\n      steps {\n        echo SECRET_KEY\n        echo SECRET_KEY.substring(0, SECRET_KEY.size() - 1) // shows the right secret was loaded, don't do this for real secrets unless you're debugging\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Scripted //\nwithCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'secret-key', variable: 'SECRET_KEY')]) {\n    echo SECRET_KEY\n    echo SECRET_KEY.substring(0, SECRET_KEY.size() - 1) // shows the right secret was loaded, don't do this for real secrets unless you're debugging\n}\n\nYou have now successfully retrieved a credential from Azure Key Vault using native Jenkins credentials integration.\n\nconfiguration-as-code integration\n\nThe Configuration as Code plugin has been designed as an opinionated way to configure Jenkins based on human-readable declarative configuration files. Writing such a file should be easy without being a Jenkins expert.\n\nFor many secrets the credential provider is enough,\nbut when integrating with other plugins you will likely need more than string credentials.\n\nYou can use the configuration-as-code plugin (aka JCasC) to allow integrating with other credential types.\n\nconfigure authentication\n\nAs the JCasC plugin runs during initial startup the Azure Key Vault credential provider needs to be configured before JCasC runs during startup.\n\nThe easiest way to do that is via environment variables set before Jenkins starts up:\n\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_URL=https://my.vault.azure.net\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_CLIENT_ID=...\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_CLIENT_SECRET=...\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=...\nexport AZURE_KEYVAULT_SP_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=...\n\nSee the azure-keyvault documentation for other authentication options.\n\nYou will now be able to refer to Azure Key Vault secret IDs in your jenkins.yaml file:\n\ncredentials:\n  system:\n    domainCredentials:\n      - credentials:\n        - usernamePassword:\n            description: \"GitHub\"\n            id: \"jenkins-github\"\n            password: \"${jenkins-github-apikey}\"\n            scope: GLOBAL\n            username: \"jenkinsadmin\"\n\nThanks for reading, send feedback on twitter using the tweet button in the top right, any issues or feature requests use GitHub issues.","title":"Introducing the Azure Key Vault Credentials Provider for Jenkins","tags":["jenkins","pipeline","security","azure","credentials","credential-provider","configuration-as-code"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"timja","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer, along with slack, azure-keyvault and configuration-as-code plugins.\nTim started using Jenkins in 2013 and became an active contributor in 2018.\nTim enjoys working on open source software in his “free” time.</p>\n</div>","id":"timja","irc":null,"linkedin":"tim-jacomb-98043174","name":"Tim Jacomb","slug":"/blog/authors/timja","twitter":"Tjaynz"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","id":"8a3a05f0-7335-5af6-9e0c-880d773b3f24","slug":"/blog/2020/03/02/findsecbugs/","strippedHtml":"Spotbugs is a utility used in Jenkins and many other Java projects to detect common Java coding mistakes and bugs. It is integrated into the build process to improve the code before it gets merged and released. Findsecbugs is a plugin for Spotbugs that adds 135 vulnerability types focused on the OWASP TOP 10 and the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). I’m working on integrating findsecbugs into our Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nBackground\n\nSpotbugs traces its history through Findbugs, which started in 2006. As Findbugs it was widely adopted by many projects. About 2016, the Findbugs project ground to a halt. Like the mythical phoenix, the Spotbugs project rose from the ashes to keep the capabilities alive. Most things are completely compatible between the two systems.\n\nJenkins has used Findbugs and now Spotbugs for years. This is integrated as a build step into parent Maven poms, including the plugin parent pom and the parent pom for libraries and core components. There are various properties that can be set to control the detection threshold, the effort, and findings or categories to exclude. Take a look at the effective pom for a project to see the settings.\n\nConundrums\n\nThere is a fundamental conundrum with introducing an analysis tool into a project. The best time to have done it is always in the past, particularly when the project first started. There are always difficulties in introducing it into an existing project. Putting it off for later just delays the useful results and makes later implementation more difficult. The best time to do it is now, as early as possible.\n\nAll analysis tools are imperfect. They report some issues that don’t actually exist. They miss some important issues. This is worse in legacy code, making the adoption more difficult. Findings have to be examined and evaluated. Some are code weaknesses but don’t indicate necessary fixes. For example, MD5 has been known for years as a weak algorithm, unsuitable for security uses. It can be used for non-security purposes, such as fingerprinting, but even there other algorithms (SHA-2) are preferred. We should replace all usages of MD5, but in some cases that’s difficult and it’s not exactly a problem.\n\nUltimately, the gain from these analysis tools isn’t so much from finding issues in existing code. The value comes more from catching new regressions that might be introduced or improving new code. This is one reason why it is valuable to add useful new analysis such as findsecbugs now, so that we can begin reaping the benefits.\n\nWith a security tool like findsecbugs, there is another paradox. Adding the tool makes it easier to find potential security issues. Attackers could take advantage of this information. However, security by obscurity is not a good design. Anyone can run findsecbugs now without the project integrating it. Integrating it makes it easier for legitimate developers to resolve issues and prevent future ones.\n\nImplementation\n\nI’ve been working on integrating findsecbugs into the Jenkins project for several months. It is working in several repos. There are several others where I have presented draft PRs to demonstrate what it will look like once it is enabled. As soon as we can disseminate the information enough, I propose to enable it in the parent poms for widespread use.\n\nExisting\n\nI started by enabling findsecbugs in two major components where I have a high degree of familiarity, Remoting, and Jenkins. Most of the work here involves examining each finding and figuring out what to do with it. In most cases this results in using one of the suppression mechanisms to ignore the finding. In some cases, the code can be removed or improved.\n\nFindsecbugs reported a significant number of false positives in Remoting for a couple of notable reasons. (See the PR.) Remoting uses Spotbugs aggressively with a Low threshold setting. This produces more results. Findsecbugs targets Java web applications. As the communication layer between agents and controller, Remoting uses some mechanisms that would be a problem on the server side but are acceptable on the agent.\n\nEven without all its plugins, Jenkins is a considerable collection of code. Findsecbugs reported a smaller number of false positives for Jenkins (See the PR.) It runs Spotbugs at a High threshold, so it only reports issues it deems more concerning. A number of these indicate code debt, deprecated code to remove, or areas that could be improved. I created Jira tickets for many of these.\n\nDemonstrated\n\nI have created draft PRs to demonstrate how findsecbugs will look in several plugins. The goal is not to use these PRs directly but instead integrate findsecbugs at the parent pom level. These PRs serve as reference documentation.\n\nCredentials\n\nThis one is particularly interesting because here findsecbugs correctly detects the remains of a valid security vulnerability ( CVE-2019-10320). Currently, this code is safely used only for migration of old data. If we had run findsecbugs on this plugin a year ago, it would have detected this valid vulnerability.\n\nSSH Build Agents\n\nThis one is interesting because it flags MD5 as a concern. Since it is used for fingerprinting, it isn’t a valid vulnerability, but since the hash isn’t stored it is easy to improve the code here.\n\nEC2\n\nIn this case, findsecbugs found some valid concerns, but the code isn’t used so it can be removed. Also, MD5 is harder to remove here but should be considered technical debt and removed when possible.\n\nPlatform Labeler\n\nFindsecbugs didn’t find any concerns here. This means adapting to it requires no work. In this demonstration, I added a fake finding to prove that it was working.\n\nFile Leak Detector\n\nThere is one simple finding noted here. Because it is part of the configuration performed by an administrator we can ignore it.\n\nCredentials Binding\n\nNothing was found here so integration requires no effort.\n\nProposed\n\nMy proposal is to integrate findsecbugs configuration into the parent poms as soon as we can. The delay is currently mostly around sharing the information to prepare developers by blog post, email list discussion, and presentation.\n\nEven before I started working on this, StefanSpieker proposed a PR to integrate into the parent Jenkins pom. This will apply to Jenkins libraries and core components. Once this is integrated, I will pull out the changes I made to the Jenkins and Remoting project poms.\n\nI also plan on integrating findsecbugs into the plugin and Stapler parent poms. Once it is added to the plugin parent pom all plugins will automatically perform these checks when they upgrade their parent pom version. If there are any findings, developers will need to take care of them as described in the next section.\n\nWhat do you need to do?\n\nOnce developers upgrade to a parent pom version that integrates findsecbugs, they may have to deal with evaluating, fixing, or suppressing findings. The parent pom versions do not yet exist but are in process or proposed.\n\nExtraneous build message\n\nIn some cases, an extraneous message may show up in the build logs. It starts with a line like this The following classes needed for analysis were missing: followed by lines listing some methods by name. Ignore this message. It results from SpotBugs printing some internal, debug information that isn’t helpful here.\n\nExamine findings\n\nIf findsecbugs reports any findings, then a developer needs to examine and determine what to do about each one.\n\nExcluding issues\n\nYou can exclude an issue, so that it is never reported in a project. This is done by configuring an exclusion file. If you encounter the findings CRLF_INJECTION_LOGS or INFORMATION_EXPOSURE_THROUGH_AN_ERROR_MESSAGE feel free to add these to an exclusion file. These are not considered a concern in Jenkins. See the Jenkins project exclusion file for an example. You should be cautious about including other issue types here.\n\nTemporarily disable findsecbugs\n\nYou may disable findsecbugs by adding to the exclusion file. I strongly encourage you to only disable findsecbugs temporarily when genuinely needed.\n\nSuppress a finding\n\nAfter determining that a finding is not important, you can suppress it by annotating a method or a class with @SuppressFBWarnings(value = “…​”, justification=”…​”). I encourage you to suppress narrowly. Never suppress at the class level when you can add it to a method. For a long method, extract the problematic part into a small method and add the suppression there. I also encourage you to always add a meaningful justification.\n\nImprove code\n\nWhenever possible improve the code such that the problematic code no longer exists. This can include removing deprecated or unused code, using improved algorithms, or improving structure or implementation. This is where the significant gains come from with SpotBugs and findsecbugs. Also, as you make changes or add new features make sure to implement them so as not to introduce new issues.\n\nReport security vulnerabilities\n\nIf you encounter a finding related to a valid security vulnerability, please report it via the Jenkins security reporting process. This is the responsible behavior that benefits the community. Try not to discuss or call attention to the issue before it can be disclosed in a Jenkins security advisory.\n\nCreate tasks\n\nIf you discover an improvement area that is too large to fit into your current work or release plan, I encourage you to record a task to get it done. You can do this in Jira, like I did for several issues in Jenkins core, or in whatever task management system you use.\n\nConclusion\n\nSpotBugs has long been used in Jenkins to catch bugs and improve code quality. Findsecbugs adds valuable security-related bug definitions. As we integrate it into the existing Jenkins code base it will require analysis and suppression for legacy code. This identifies areas we can improve and enhances quality as we move forward. Please responsibly report any security vulnerabilites you discover.","title":"Findsecbugs for Developers","tags":["jenkins","security","developer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#685848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/19e71/jeffret-b.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/77b35/jeffret-b.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/d4a57/jeffret-b.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/19e71/jeffret-b.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/68974/jeffret-b.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/ef6ff/jeffret-b.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/8257c/jeffret-b.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/6766a/jeffret-b.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f1cc92ec0a7523e21842aee0aebbb56c/22bfc/jeffret-b.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"jeffret-b","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jeff has been using Jenkins for many years.\nSince 2018 he has been contributing to Jenkins core and plugins.\nHe maintains the Remoting library and participates on the Jenkins security team.</p>\n</div>","id":"jeffret-b","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Jeff Thompson","slug":"/blog/authors/jeffret-b","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"security","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":7,"currentPage":1}},
