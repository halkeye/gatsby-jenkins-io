This compromise could have taken advantage of, what\ncould be categorized as, an attempt to target contributors with elevated\naccess. Unfortunately, when facing the uncertainty of a potential compromise,\nthe safest option is to treat it as if it were an actual incident, and react\naccordingly. The machine in question had access to binaries published to our\nprimary and secondary mirrors, and to contributor account information.\n\nSince this machine is not the source of truth for Jenkins binaries, we verified\nthat the files distributed to Jenkins users: plugins, packages, etc, were not\ntampered with. We cannot, however, verify that contributor account information\nwas not accessed or tampered with and, as a proactive measure, we are issuing a\npassword reset for all contributor accounts. We have also spent significant effort\nmigrating all key services off of the potentially compromised machine to\n(virtual) hardware so the machine can be re-imaged or decommissioned entirely.\n\nWhat you should do now\n\nIf you have ever filed an issue in JIRA,\nedited a wiki page, released a plugin or\notherwise created an account via the Jenkins\nwebsite, you have a Jenkins community account. You should be receiving a\npassword reset email shortly, but if you have re-used your Jenkins account\npassword with other services we strongly encourage you to update your passwords\nwith those other services.  If you’re not already using one, we also encourage\nthe use of a password manager for generating and managing service-specific\npasswords.\n\nThe generated password sent out is temporary and will expire if you do not\nuse it to update your account. Once it expires you will need recover your\naccount with the password reset\nin the accounts app.\n\nThis does not apply to your own Jenkins installation, or any account that you\nmay use to log into it. If you do not have a Jenkins community account, there is\nno action you need to take.\n\nWhat we’re doing to prevent events like this in the future\n\nAs stated above, the potentially compromised machine is being removed from our\ninfrastructure. That helps address the immediate problem but doesn’t put\nguarantees in place for the future. To help prevent potential issues in the\nfuture we’re taking the following actions:\n\nIncorporating more security policy enforcement into our\nPuppet-driven infrastructure. Without a\nconfiguration management tool enforcing a given state for some legacy services,\nuser error and manual mis-configurations can adversely affect project security.\nAs of right now, all key services are managed by Puppet.\n\nBalkanizing our machine and permissions model more. The machine affected was\nliterally the first independent (outside of Sun) piece of project\ninfrastructure and like many legacy systems, it grew to host a multitude of\nservices. We are rapidly evolving away from that model with increasing levels\nof user and host separation for project services.\n\nIn a similar vein, we have also introduced a trusted zone in our\ninfrastructure which is not routable on the public internet, where sensitive\noperations, such as generating update center information, can be managed and\nsecured more effectively.\n\nWe are performing an infrastructure permissions audit. Some portions of our\ninfrastructure are 6+ years old and have had contributors come and go. Any\ninactive users with unnecessarily elevated permissions in the project\ninfrastructure will have those permissions revoked.\n\nI would like to extend thanks, on behalf of the Jenkins project, to\nCloudBees for their help in funding and\nmigrating this infrastructure.\n\nIf you have further questions about the Jenkins project infrastructure, you can\njoin us in the #jenkins-infra channel on Freenode\nor in an Infrastructure Q&A session I’ve scheduled for next Wednesday (April\n27) at 20:00 UTC (12:00 PST).","title":"Possible Jenkins Project Infrastructure Compromise","tags":["infra","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
