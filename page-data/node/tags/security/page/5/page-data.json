see https://jenkins.io/redirect/class-filter/\n\nwhere the link would direct you here.\n\nIf you find such a case, please report it in the Jenkins issue tracker, under the appropriate plugin component.\nLink it to JENKINS-47736 and add the JEP-200 label.\nIf at all possible, include complete steps to reproduce the problem from scratch.\nJenkins developers will strive to evaluate the reason for the violation and offer a fix in the form of a core and/or plugin update.\nFor more details and current status, see\nPlugins affected by fix for JEP-200.\n\nAssuming you see no particular reason to think that the class in question has dangerous deserialization semantics, which is rare,\nit is possible to work around the problem in your own installation as a temporary expedient.\nSimply make note of any class name(s) mentioned in such log messages,\nand run Jenkins with this startup option (details will depend on your installation method):\n\n-Dhudson.remoting.ClassFilter=some.pkg.and.ClassName,some.pkg.and.OtherClassName\n\nFor plugin developers\n\nTesting plugins against Jenkins 2.102 and above\n\nAs a plugin developer encountering this kind of error,\nyour first task is to ensure that it is reproducible in a functional ( JenkinsRule) test\nwhen running Jenkins 2.102 or newer to reproduce the error.\n\nmvn test -Djenkins.version=2.102 -Denforcer.skip=true\n\nThe above assumes you are using a recent 2.x or 3.x parent Plugin POM.\nFor certain cases you may need to use Plugin Compat Tester (PCT)\nto run tests against Jenkins core versions newer than your baseline.\n\nRunning PCT against the latest Jenkins core:\n\njava -jar pct-cli.jar -reportFile $(pwd)/out/pct-report.xml \\\n    -workDirectory $(pwd)/work -skipTestCache true -mvn $(which mvn) \\\n    -includePlugins ${ARTIFACT_ID} -localCheckoutDir ${YOUR_PLUGIN_REPO}\n\nYou may need to run tests using an agent or force saves of plugin settings.\n\nFor maven plugins you can also specify custom Jenkins versions in Jenkinsfile to run tests against JEP-200:\n\nbuildPlugin(jenkinsVersions: [null, '2.102'])\n\n(again picking whatever version you need to test against)\nso that the test is included during CI builds, even while your minimum core baseline predates JEP-200.\n\nIf your plugins are built with Gradle, your mileage may vary.\n\nMaking plugins compatible with Jenkins 2.102 or above\n\nIf you discover a compatibility issue in your plugin,\nyou then have several choices for fixing the problem:\n\nIdeally, simplify your code so that the mentioned class is not deserialized via Jenkins Remoting or XStream to begin with:\n\nIf the problem occurred when receiving a response from an agent, change your Callable (or FileCallable) to return a plainer type.\n\nIf the problem occurred when saving an XML file (such as a config.xml or build.xml), use a plainer type in non- transient fields in your persistable plugin classes.\n\nIf the class(es) are defined in the Java Platform or some library bundled in Jenkins core, propose a pull request adding it to core/src/main/resources/jenkins/security/whitelisted-classes.txt in jenkinsci/jenkins.\n\nIf the class(es) are defined in a third-party library bundled in your plugin, create a resource file META-INF/hudson.remoting.ClassFilter listing them. ( example)\n\nYou may also do this for Java or Jenkins core library classes, as a hotfix until your core baseline includes the whitelist entry proposed above.\n\nIf the class(es) are defined in a JAR you build and then bundle in your plugin’s *.jpi, add a Jenkins-ClassFilter-Whitelisted: true manifest entry. This whitelists every class in the JAR.

just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.95 and 2.89.2, that fix two security vulnerabilities.\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\n\nWe usually announce core security updates well in advance on the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list, to give Jenkins administrators time to schedule a maintenance.\nAdditionally, we try to align security updates with the regular LTS schedule.\nWe have chosen not to do so in this case for two reasons:\n\nThe random failure to set up Jenkins is very noticeable, and given that we’ve seen automated exploits for unprotected Jenkins instances in the past we consider it important to fix that issue as soon as possible, so that users setting up new instances of Jenkins can be confident they won’t start up insecurely.\n\nThe CSRF issue appears to only affect instances for a very short (seconds at most, if at all) time period immediately after startup, so administrators could apply the fix during the next scheduled Jenkins downtime, rather than immediately.","title":"Security updates for Jenkins

just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.57 and 2.46.2, that fix several security vulnerabilities, including a critical one.\n\nThat critical vulnerability is an unauthenticated remote code execution via the remoting-based CLI.\nWhen I announced the fix for the previous vulnerability of this kind, I announced our plans to revisit the design of the CLI that enabled this class of vulnerabilities.\n\nSince Jenkins 2.54, we now have a new CLI implementation that isn’t based on remoting, and deprecated its remoting mode.\nDespite it being a major feature, we decided to backport it to 2.46.2, so LTS users can also disable the unsafe remoting mode while retaining almost all of the CLI’s existing functionality.\n\nFor an overview of what was fixed, see the security advisory.\nFor an overview on the possible impact of these changes on upgrading Jenkins LTS, see our LTS upgrade guide.\nI recommend you read these documents, especially if you’re using the CLI with Jenkins LTS, as there are possible side effects of these fixes.\n\nSubscribe to the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list to receive important notifications related to Jenkins
