The Fitnesse plugin saw multiple releases again this week, along with the Libvirt Slaves plugin which has seen an amazing number of releases since it burst onto the plugin scene two weeks ago.\n\nThere were a few new and notable plugins released this week such as the iPhoneView plugin which adds a fancy view to make checking Hudson all that prettier on an iPhone or iPod Touch, the cross-platform shell plugin was released, aiming to solve the problem of running a job on both Windows and Unix agents. My favorite new plugin release this week has to be the Gerrit plugin which made its debut and shows a lot of potential to enable the \"pre-tested commit\" workflow with Git and Gerrit\n\nMar 20, 2010\n\nFitnesse plugin 1.2\n\nLabeled Test Groups Publisher 1.2.6\n\nLibvirt Slaves plugin 1.3\n\nMonitoring 1.13.0\n\nPerforce Plugin 1.0.25\n\niPhoneView plugin 0.1\n\ninstant-messaging plugin 1.6\n\nMar 21, 2010\n\nFitnesse plugin 1.3\n\nIvy plugin 1.4\n\nMar 22, 2010\n\nBuckminster 0.9.4\n\nCobertura plugin 0.8.11\n\nFitnesse plugin 1.3.1\n\nGerrit plugin 0.1\n\nJIRA plugin 1.21\n\nMaven Release Plug-in nexus helper 0.0.3\n\nNested View Plugin 1.1\n\nPerformance plugin 1.2\n\nSonar Plugin 1.5\n\nSubversion Plug-in 1.15\n\nTranslation Assitance plugin 1.4\n\nMar 23, 2010\n\nSubversion Plug-in 1.16\n\nnabaztag 1.9\n\nMar 24, 2010\n\nBuckminster 0.9.5\n\nJabber notifier plugin 1.8\n\nMar 25, 2010\n\nhttps://www.collab.net/[CollabNet] Plugins 1.1.4\n\nCVS Plug-in 1.1\n\nDashboard View 1.4\n\nLibvirt Slaves plugin 1.4\n\nPerforce Plugin 1.0.26\n\nMar 26, 2010\n\nCMake plugin 1.2\n\nGNAT plugin 0.2.2\n\nGroovy Postbuild 1.2\n\ncppunit plugin 1.3\n\ncross-platform shell plugin 0.2","title":"This Week in Plugins","tags":["infrastructure","feedback"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

This gives those of us in the Hudson development community a good sense of what’s really important to our users, which in turn helps us decide where to focus our efforts. If you’re interested, you can see the top voted issues over at our JIRA server.\n\nA good number of those issues have been high on the list for a while - I’m actually in the early stages of work on a plugin to answer HUDSON-682, the current #1 most voted-for issue, two and a half years after it was opened. But I’m sure there are some equally useful features Hudson users would like to see added which aren’t on that list. So I’m asking you, dear readers: what are you looking for in Hudson that isn’t already there? Take a look around the existing issues - you may find a request that fits what you want lurking just out of the top 10, needing only your vote to push it into the spotlight. If no one’s yet created an issue requesting your desired feature, well, create one.\n\nOr, better still, write a plugin or contribute a patch yourself!\n\nEditor’s Note: If you’re interested in writing a plugin, you can check out Hudson’s wiki and/or this guide on the subject.\n\nAndrew Bayer ( abayer) has been a contributor to Hudson since early 2009, contributing to the ClearCase plugin, Hudson’s core and a small number of other plugins. Andrew also helps Kohsuke with a lot of Hudson’s project infrastructure, most notably the migration from Bugzilla on Java.net to JIRA running at issues.hudson-ci.org.","title":"What new features do you want to see?","tags":["infrastructure","development","core","just for fun","jenkinsci"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
