The contributor summit is the place where the current and future contributors of the Jenkins project get together. This year, the theme is “working together”. Traditionally, most contributors are plugin maintainers focusing on their own plugins, but it’s important to look at Jenkins as a whole, because that’s how users experience it. There is more to the project beyond writing plugins, and even for plugin developers, there are increasing number of common libraries and modules that plugins should rely on. In short, we should work better together.\n\nA few contributors will prepare some presentations to help clarify what that means, and what all of us can do. And in the afternoon, there will be \"unconference\" sessions to brainstorm and discuss what we can do and how.\n\nWhether you are already a contributor or just thinking about becoming one, please join us for this full day free event.\n\nDetails about this year’s agenda are available on the event’s meetup page.\nAttending is free, and no Jenkins World ticket is needed, but RSVP if you’re going to attend to help us plan.\n\nSee you there!","title":"Jenkins World Contributor

is a guest post by Brent Laster, Senior Manager, Research and Development at\nSAS.\n\nJenkins Pipeline\nhas fundamentally changed how users can orchestrate their pipelines and workflows.\nEssentially, anything that you can do in a script or program can now be done in a Jenkinsfile or in a pipeline script created within the application.\nBut just because you can do nearly anything directly in those mechanisms doesn’t mean you necessarily should.\n\nIn some cases, it’s better to abstract the functionality out separately from your main Pipeline.\nPreviously, the main way to do this in Jenkins itself was through creating plugins.\nWith Jenkins 2 and the tight incorporation of Pipeline, we now have another approach – shared libraries.\n\nBrent will be\npresenting\nmore of this topic at Jenkins World in\nAugust, register with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.\n\nShared libraries\nprovide solutions for a number of situations that can be challenging or time-consuming to deal with in Pipeline.\nAmong them:\n\nProviding common routines that can be accessed across a number of pipelines or within a designated scope (more on scope later)\n\nAbstracting out complex or restricted code\n\nProviding a means to execute scripted code from calls in declarative pipelines (where scripted code is not normally allowed)\n\nSimplifying calls in a script to custom code that only differ by calling parameters\n\nTo understand how to use shared libraries in Pipeline, we first need to understand how they are constructed.\nA shared library for Jenkins consists of a source code repository with a structure like the one below:\n\nEach of the top-level directories has its own purpose.\n\nThe resources directory can have non-groovy resources that get loaded via the libraryResource step.\nThink of this as a place to store supporting data files such as json files.\n\nThe src directory uses a structure similar to the standard Java src layout.\nThis area is added to the classpath when a Pipeline that includes this shared library is executed.\n\nThe vars directory holds global variables that should be accessible from pipeline scripts.\nA corresponding.txt file can be included that defines documentation for objects here.\nIf found, this will be pulled in as part of the documentation in the Jenkins application.\n\nAlthough you might think that it would always be best to define library functions in the src structure, it actually works better in many cases to define them in the vars area.\nThe notion of a global variable may not correspond very well to a global function, but you can think of it as the function being a global value that can be pulled in and used in your pipeline.\nIn fact, to work in a declarative style pipeline, having your function in the vars area is the only option.\n\nLet’s look at a simple function that we can create for a shared library.\nIn this case, we’ll just wrap picking up the location of the Gradle installation from Jenkins and calling the corresponding executable with whatever tasks are passed in as arguments.\nThe code is below:\n\n/vars/gbuild.groovy\n\ndef call(args) {\n      sh \"${tool 'gradle3'}/bin/gradle ${args}\"\n}\n\nNotice that we are using a structured form here with the def call syntax.\nThis allows us to simply invoke the routine in our pipeline (assuming we have loaded the shared library) based on the name of the file in the vars area.\nFor example, since we named this file gbuild.groovy, then we can invoke it in our pipeline via a step like this:\n\ngbuild 'clean compileJava'\n\nSo, how do we get our shared library loaded to use in our pipeline?\nThe shared library itself is just code in the structure outlined above committed/pushed into a source code repository that Jenkins can access.\nIn our example, we’ll assume we’ve staged, committed, and pushed this code into a local Git repository on the system at /opt/git/shared-library.git.\n\nLike most other things in Jenkins, we need to first tell Jenkins where this shared library can be found and how to reference it \"globally\" so that pipelines can reference it specifically.\n\nFirst, though, we need to decide at what scope you want this shared library to be available.\nThe most common case is making it a \"global shared library\" so that all Pipelines can access it.\nHowever, we also have the option of only making shared libraries available for projects in a particular Jenkins Folder structure,\nor those in a Multibranch Pipeline, or those in a GitHub Organization pipeline project.\n\nTo keep it simple, we’ll just define ours to be globally available to all pipelines.\nDoing this is a two-step process.\nWe first tell Jenkins what we want to call the library and define some default behavior for Jenkins related to the library,\nsuch as whether we wanted it loaded implicitly for all pipelines.\nThis is done in the Global Pipeline Libraries section of the Configure System page.\n\nFor the second part, we need to tell Jenkins where the actual source repository for the shared library is located.\nSCM plugins that have been modified to understand how to work with shared libraries are called \" Modern SCM\".\nThe git plugin in one of these updated plugin, so we just supply the information in the same Configure System page.\n\nAfter configuring Jenkins so that it can find the shared library repository, we can load the shared library into our pipeline using the @Library(' ') annotation.\nSince Annotations\nare designed to annotate something that follows them,\nwe need to either include a specific import statement, or, if we want to include everything, we can use an underscore character as a placeholder.\nSo our basic step to load the library in a pipeline would be:\n\n@Library('Utilities2') _\n\nBased on this step, when Jenkins runs our Pipeline, it will first go out to the repository that holds the shared library and clone down a copy to use.\nThe log output during this part of the pipeline execution would look something like this:\n\nLoading library Utilities2@master\n > git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree # timeout=10\nSetting origin to /opt/git/shared-libraries\n > git config remote.origin.url /opt/git/shared-libraries # timeout=10\nFetching origin...\nFetching upstream changes from origin\n > git --version # timeout=10\nusing GIT_SSH to set credentials Jenkins2 SSH\n > git fetch --tags --progress origin +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*\n > git rev-parse master^{commit} # timeout=10\n > git rev-parse origin/master^{commit} # timeout=10\nCloning the remote Git repository\nCloning repository /opt/git/shared-libraries\n\nThen Pipeline can call our shared library gbuild function and translate it to the desired Gradle build commands.\n\nFirst time build.\nSkipping changelog.\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // stage\n[Pipeline] stage\n[Pipeline] { (Compile)\n[Pipeline] tool\n[Pipeline] sh\n[gsummit17_lab2-4T357CUTJORMC2TIF7WW5LMRR37F7PM2QRUHXUNSRTWTTRHB3XGA]\nRunning shell script\n+ /usr/share/gradle/bin/gradle clean compileJava -x test\nStarting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)\n\nThis is a very basic illustration of how using shared libraries work.\nThere is much more detail and functionality surrounding shared libraries, and extending your pipeline in general, than we can cover here.\n\nBe sure to catch my talk on\nExtending your Pipeline with Shared Libraries, Global Functions and External Code\nat Jenkins World 2017.\nAlso, watch for my new book on\nJenkins 2 Up and Running\nwhich will have a dedicated chapter on this – expected to be available later this year from O’Reilly.","title":"Extending your Pipeline with Shared Libraries, Global
