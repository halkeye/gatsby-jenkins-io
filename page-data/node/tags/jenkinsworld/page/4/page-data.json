These three\nindividuals has consistently demonstrated excellence and proven value to the\nproject. With gratitude and congratulations, below are the well deserved\nwinners:\n\nAlex Earl - Most Valuable Contributor\n\nAlex is the current or previous maintainer of some of the most used Jenkins\nplugins and has been for years. He’s a regular contributor to project policy\ndiscussions, and helps to keep the project running by improving the Jenkins\nproject infrastructure, moderating the mailing lists and processing requests\nfor hosting new plugins.\n\nSteve Marlowe - Jenkins Security MVP\n\nSteve is one of the most prolific reporter of security vulnerabilities in\nJenkins. His reports are well-written, clearly identify the problematic\nbehavior, and provide references that help quickly resolve the reported issue.\nOn top of that, Steve is always responsive when asked for clarification.\n\nTomonari Nakamura - Most Valuable Advocate\n\nTomonari leads the Jenkins User Group in Tokyo, which is one of the largest and\nthe most active with a long history. The group has been organizing meet-ups for\nmore than 10 times now, and every meet-up fills up to 100% very quickly with\nregular turn-out of 100-200 people. At one point the group under his leadership\norganized a fully volunteer-run \"Jenkins User Conference\" in Tokyo that\ncommanded 1000+ attendees.\n\nCongratulations to our winners.\n\nWe can’t wait to recognize more contributors at Jenkins World 2018!","title":"Jenkins Contributors Awarded Top Honors at Jenkins World 2017","tags":["event","jenkinsworld"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/8d248/alyssat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/c004c/alyssat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/9e67b/alyssat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/22924/alyssat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/89767/alyssat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/40d97/alyssat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/5028e/alyssat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":166}}},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"/blog/author/alyssat","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":"5b2d3ef5-84a4-5c1d-9c5a-91281a16952a","slug":"/blog/2017/09/27/sept-jenkins-online-meetup/","strippedHtml":"At Jenkins World last month, we continued the tradition of \"lunch-time demos\"\nin the Jenkins project’s booth which we started in 2016.

Originally filed as\nJENKINS-26481 in 2015,\nit became one of the most voted for, and watched, tickets in the entire issue\ntracker until it was ultimately fixed earlier this year.\n\nAt least some closures are executed only once inside of Groovy CPS DSL scripts\nmanaged by the workflow plugin.\n\n— Original bug description by Daniel Tschan\n\nAt a high level, what has been confusing for many users is that Scripted\nPipeline looks like a Groovy, it quacks like a Groovy, but it’s not exactly\nGroovy. Rather, there’s an custom Groovy interpreter\n( CPS) that executes the\nScripted Pipeline in a manner which provides the durability/resumability that\ndefines Jenkins Pipeline.\n\nWithout diving into too much detail, refer to the pull requests linked to\nJENKINS-26481 for that, the code snippet above was particularly challenging to\nrectify inside the Pipeline execution layer. As one of the chief architects for\nJenkins Pipeline, Jesse made a number of changes around the problem in 2016,\nbut it wasn’t until early 2017 when Andrew, working on Declarative Pipeline,\nstarted to identify a number of areas of improvement in CPS and provided\nmultiple patches and test cases.\n\nAs luck would have it, combining two of the sharpest minds in the Jenkins\nproject resulted in the \"Small Matter of Programming\" being finished, and\nreleased in May of this year with Pipeline: Groovy 2.33.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating, and thanking, Andrew and Jesse for their\ndiligent and hard work smashing one of the most despised bugs in Jenkins\nhistory :).","title":"Closure on enumerators in Pipeline","tags":["pipeline","jenkinsworld"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/77b35/rtyler.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/d4a57/rtyler.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/19e71/rtyler.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/68974/rtyler.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/ef6ff/rtyler.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/8257c/rtyler.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/6766a/rtyler.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/c98b6de76465e89f9f5e5b331e9abfea/22bfc/rtyler.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.

Adopt a Plugin\n\nThe Jenkins plugin ecosystem covers a wide range of areas.\nJenkins plugin maintainers come from many different backgrounds, with many different interests.\nOften, a plugin maintainer may find that they want to do something different on the project, or they may leave the project.\nWhen a plugin maintainer is no longer able to maintain a plugin, they can place it for adoption.\n\nPlugins placed for adoption range from very specific use cases (node stalker plugin) to very general use cases (Subversion plugin).\n\nMaintaining an orphan plugin is a great way to contribute to the project.\nFollow the instructions to \" Adopt a Plugin\".\n\nSee You There!\n\nAll those techniques (and more) are available on the Jenkins participate page.\n\nLook for the \"Jenkins Needs You\" poster at Jenkins World, and come talk\nto us about the ways you can learn new things, address your concerns,\nand help Jenkins.\n\nJoin the Jenkins project at\nJenkins World on August 30-31,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Jenkins Needs You -

This is opposed to the traditional way of creating a Jenkins\nproject by using the Jenkins GUI. When running your open-source load test,\nJenkins Pipeline enables resilience, execution control, advanced logic and\nVersion Control management.  This blog post will explain how to run any\nopen-source load test with Jenkins Pipeline, through Taurus.\n\nTaurus is an open source test automation framework\nthat enables running and analyzing tests from 9 open source load and functional\ntesting tools: JMeter,\nSelenium, Gatling, The Grinder, Locust, Tsung, Siege, Apache Bench, and PBench.\nTest results can be analyzed in Taurus. For advanced analyses or running tests\nin the cloud, Taurus integrates with\nBlazeMeter.\n\nGuy will be\npresenting\nmore on this topic at\nJenkins World in August,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.\n\nGetting started with Taurus\n\nInstall Taurus.\n\nCreate the following Taurus configuration in YAML. Learn more about YAML in Taurus from\nthis tutorial.\n\n## execution:\n- concurrency: 100\n  hold-for: 10m\n  ramp-up: 120s\n  scenario: Thread Group\nscenarios:\n  Thread Group:\n    requests:\n    - label: blazedemo\n      method: GET\n      url: http://blazedemo.com/\n\nThis script runs 100 concurrent users, holds the load for 10 minutes, the\nramp-up is 120 seconds and the thread group runs one GET request to\nblazedemo.com.\n\nYou can specify an executor by adding executor: to the\nscript. Otherwise, the default executor will be JMeter. In the background,\nTaurus will create an artifact directory with a jmx file (or a Scala file if\nyou run Gatling, a Python file if you are running Selenium, etc.).\n\nOpen a terminal and run: bzt.yml\n\nView the test results:\n\nIf you want to conduct an in-depth analysis of your test results, run your\ntests on BlazeMeter. You will be able to monitor KPIs through advanced and\ncolorful reports, evaluate system health over time, and run your tests from\nmultiple geo-locations.\n\nRun the following command from the terminal:\n\nbzt.yml -report\n\nIntegrate Taurus With Pipeline\n\nTo run Taurus through Pipeline, you can also go\nstraight to Jenkins after creating your Taurus script.\n\nOpen Jenkins → New Item → Fill in an item name → Click on ‘Pipeline’\n\nNow create a Pipeline script. You can include all parts of\nyour CI/CD process in this script: Commit, Build, Unit Test, Performance Test,\netc., by creating different stages.\n\nThis Pipeline has three stages: The first is called “build”. In this example it\nis empty, but you can add commands that will build your code. The second,\ncalled “Performance Tests”, creates a folder called “Taurus-Repo” and runs the\nTaurus script that we created. At the same time (note the “parallel” command),\nthere is a “sleep” command for 60 seconds. Obviously it makes no sense to put\nthose two commands together, this is just to show you the option of running 2\ncommands in parallel. The third stage called “Deploy” is also empty in this\nexample. This is where you could deploy your new version.\n\nnode {\n   stage('Build') {\n      // Run the Taurus build\n   }\n   stage('Performance Tests') {\n    parallel(\n        BlazeMeterTest: {\n            dir ('Taurus-Repo') {\n                sh 'bzt.yml -report'\n            }\n        },\n        Analysis: {\n            sleep 60\n        })\n   }\n\n   stage(‘Deploy’) {\n   }\n}\n\nNote that you can either add the Pipeline inline, or choose the “Pipeline\nscript from SCM” option and add the URL to the script on GitHub (in this case\nyou need to upload a Jenkinsfile to GitHub). With \"Pipeline from SCM\",\nwhenever you need to update the tests, you can just add new commits to the\nJenkinsfile.\n\nSave the Pipeline\n\nClick on ‘Build Now’ to run the Pipeline\n\nClick on the new Build that is running now (build #6 in this example).\n\nClick on ‘Console Output’ to see the test results:\n\nIn the Console Output you can see the test results and also the link to the report in BlazeMeter.\n\nThat’s it! Jenkins Pipeline is now running open-source load testing tools via Taurus.\n\nCome to\nmy\nfree hands-on workshop “Learn to Release Faster by Load Testing With Jenkins”\nat Jenkins World 2017 on Tuesday August 29th from 1-5pm.  You will learn how to\ntest continuously with Jenkins, JMeter, BlazeMeter and Taurus, including how to\nrun JMeter with Jenkins, run the BlazeMeter plugin for Jenkins and how to use\nopen-source Taurus.\n\nTo learn more about BlazeMeter,\nclick here.","title":"Running load tests in Jenkins Pipeline with Taurus","tags":["event","jenkinsworld"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/author/hinman","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","id":"1ddf93ad-21ef-5f16-9fd5-7a69d3fb97d3","slug":"/blog/2017/08/03/jenkinsworld-ask-the-experts/","strippedHtml":"This is a guest post by Alyssa Tong, who runs\nthe Jenkins Area Meetup program and is also responsible for\nMarketing & Community Programs at CloudBees, Inc.\n\nThere are less than four weeks left until Jenkins World 2017.

And then you notice that your build is the first\nin over a year. And then you realize that you have accidentally become the\nsubject matter expert in this app.\n\nYou have no clue what change caused this failure or when that change occurred.\nDid one Jenkins agent become a\nsnowflake server,\naccruing cruft on the file system that is not cleaned up before each build?\nDid some unpinned external dependency upgrade in a backwards-incompatible fashion?\nDid the credentials the build plan was using to connect to source control get rotated?\nDid a dependent system go offline?\nOr - and I realize that this is unthinkable - did you legitimately break a test?\n\nNot only is this type of archaeological expedition often a bad time for the\nperson who happened to commit to this app (\"No good deed goes unpunished\"), but\nit’s also unnecessary. There’s a simple way to reduce the cognitive load it\ntakes to connect cause and effect: build more frequently.\n\nOne way we achieve this is by writing scripts to maintain our apps. When we\nbuild, the goal is that an equivalent artifact should be produced unless there\nwas a change to the app in source control. As such, we pin all of our\ndependencies to specific versions. But we also don’t want to languish on old\nversions of dependencies, whether internal or external. So we also have an\nauto-maintain script that bumps all of these versions and commits the result.\n\nI’ll give an example. We use docker to build and deploy our apps, and each app\ndepends on a base image that we host in a docker registry. So a Dockerfile in\none of our apps would have a line like this:\n\nFROM our.registry.example.com/rosettastone/sweet-repo:jenkins-awesome-project-sweet-repo-5\n\nWe build our base images in Jenkins and tag them with the Jenkins $BUILD_TAG,\nso this app is using build 5 of the rosettastone/sweet-repo base image.\nLet’s say we updated our sweet-repo base image to use ubuntu 16.04 instead of 14.04\nand this resulted in build 6 of the base image. Our auto-maintain script takes\ncare of upgrading an app that uses this base image to the most recent version.\nThe steps in the auto-maintain script look like this:\n\nFigure out what base image tag you’re using.\n\nFind the newest version of that base image tag by querying the docker registry.\n\nIf necessary, update the FROM line in the app’s Dockerfile to pull in the most recent version.\n\nWe do the same thing with library dependencies.\nIf our Gemfile.lock is referencing an old library, running auto-maintain will update things.\nThe same applies to the Jenkinsfile for each app. If we decide to implement a new policy where we\ndiscard old builds, we update auto-maintain so that it will bring each app into\ncompliance with the policy, by changing, for example, this Jenkinsfile :\n\nJenkinsfile (Before)\n\npipeline {\n  agent { label 'docker' }\n  stages {\n    stage('commit_stage') {\n      steps {\n        sh('./bin/ci')\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nto this:\n\nJenkinsfile (After)\n\npipeline {\n  agent { label 'docker' }\n  options {\n    buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '100'))\n  }\n  stages {\n    stage('commit_stage') {\n      steps {\n        sh('./bin/ci')\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWe try to account for these sorts of things (everything that we can) in our\nauto-maintain script rather than updating apps manually, since this reduces the\nfriction in keeping apps standardized.\n\nOnce you create an auto-maintain script (start small), you just have to run it.\nWe run ours based on both \"actions\" and \"non-actions.\" When an internal library\nchanges, we kick off app builds, so a library’s Jenkinsfile might look like\nthis:\n\nJenkinsfile\n\npipeline {\n  agent { label 'docker' }\n  stages {\n    stage('commit_stage') {\n      steps {\n        sh('./bin/ci')\n      }\n    }\n    stage('auto_maintain_things_that_might_be_using_me') {\n      steps {\n        build('hot-project/auto-maintain-all-apps/master')\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhen auto-maintain updates something in an app, we have it commit the change\nback to the app, which in turn triggers a build of that app, and—​if all is\nwell—​a production deployment.\n\nThe only missing link then for avoiding one-year build droughts is to get around\nthe problem where auto-maintain isn’t actually updating anything in a certain app.\nIf no dependencies are changing, or if the technology in question is not\nreceiving much attention, auto-maintain might not do anything for an\nextended period of time, even if the script is run on a schedule using\ncron . For those cases, putting\na cron trigger in the Pipeline for each app will ensure that builds still happen periodically:\n\nJenkinsfile\n\npipeline {\n  agent { label 'docker' }\n  triggers {\n    cron('@weekly')\n  }\n  stages {\n    stage('commit_stage') {\n      steps {\n        sh('./bin/ci')\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn most cases, these periodic builds won’t do anything different from the last\nbuild, but when something does break, this strategy will allow you to decide\nwhen you find out about it (by making your cron @weekly, @daily, etc)\ninstead of letting some poor developer find out about it when they do\nsomething silly like commit code to an infrequently-modified app.\n\nKevin will be\npresenting\nmore on this topic at\nJenkins World in August,\nregister with the code JWFOSS for a 30% discount off your pass.","title":"Automated Software Maintenance","tags":["event","jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2017"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":null,"html":"","id":"hinman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Hannah Inman","slug":"/blog/author/hinman","twitter":null}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"jenkinsworld","limit":8,"skip":24,"numPages":8,"currentPage":4}},
