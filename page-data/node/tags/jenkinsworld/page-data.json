Jenkins is not just a community, it is a family. When GSoC period was over, we received swags from Jenkins.\nNatasha Stopa (one of the students in GSoC 2019) was invited to attend DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco.\nIt was nice to see her enjoy there. But guess what? Jenkins also invited three other students (Abhyudaya, Long and me) to DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon.\nI was super psyched when Marky Jackson (one of my project mentors) broke the news to me.\n\nThe trip to Lisbon required to sort a few things like flight tickets, hotel booking, passport, visa etc. Oleg Nenashev had scheduled meetings to discuss\nand help us with arranging everything for our travel. Thanks to him. :)\n\nFrom India to Lisbon (Dec 1)\n\nAbhyudaya and I boarded our flight from Indira Gandhi Airport (New Delhi) to Lisbon on December 1, 2019 morning at 0500 hours (local time). It was a fine\ntrip with an hour layover in Istanbul Ataturk Airport. We arrived in Lisbon at 1500 hours (local time). The weather in Lisbon was terrific. A mild cold\nbut strong sea breeze was the starting point of me falling in love with the place. We arrived at our hotel (Novotel Lisboa) in an Uber. Oleg met us at\nthe lobby to help us with check-in. It was great to finally meet him in person after months of knowing and working together. We had a good chat about the\nevent, what to expect and other sightseeing areas. After a short time of refresh, Long who traveled from Berlin a day before met us at the restaurant. We\nhad a brief chat knowing each other, had our food and went to bed. The next day was Hackfest. We hit the bed after that as we had to reach Centro de\nCongressos de Lisboa (CCL) where the event was organised by 0900 hours.\n\nDay 0 (Dec 2)\n\nI woke up early for a short jog in the streets. Lisbon is a city made on hills. The streets have beautiful mosaic styled pavements. It was\nnice to see around the city. Then Abhyudaya and me went for breakfast and reached CCL in an Uber at 0815 hours.\n\nThere was a round table sitting arrangement in an auditorium. It was like a meet-and-greet event to interact with other developers (some known and some new).\nEverybody had to figure out their problem statements and work on it. There was milk, juice, sandwiches which gave us energy throughout the day. I took a\nsmall break to come out of the building to go to the other side of the road which was on the banks of Tagus River. From there you could have very close\nview underneath the Ponte 25 de Abril (looks strikingly similar to Golden Gate Bridge). You can also see The Sanctuary of Christ the King on the other side\nof the river (again looks similar to Christ the Redeemer in Rio, Brazil). It was great to kick off the event with Hackfest. At the end of Hackfest some of\nus presented our work. Later, we went to a nearby restaurant to have burgers which apparently was the best burger I ever had (could be because I hadn’t\ntried too many burgers before :P). We talked and interacted with people from other parts of the world for about an hour and a half then went back to our hotel\nrooms.\n\nDay 1 (Dec 3)\n\nThe conference officially began on this day. Abyudaya and me had breakfast and took the shuttle to CCL. We collected our t-shirts and IDs. The event managing team\nmade an app for DevOps World | Jenkins World (DWJW) Lisbon with all schedules and other informations which was incredibly convenient for all attendees.\nThere were multiple sessions/events on different topics related to Jenkins or DevOps in general. I attended the Jenkins and Jenkins X contributor summit.\nHad a nice lunch and went around to explore Lisbon. I went to Padrao dos Descobrimentos and the beautiful Belem Palace. Had some Pasteis de Belem\n(a popular Portuguese desert). Took a tram to Praça do Comércio. It is Lisbon’s most important square. You will find lots of tourists, street bands,\nsea food restaurants, shops for every budget, the famous pink street and so much more. Later that evening we had a party hosted by EURODOG (European\nDevOps Group) at Lisboa Marriott. It was a nice party to network with developers over casual wine and beer. We later head out to a nearby Indian restaurant\nfor Kebab and rice.\n\nDay 2 (Dec 4)\n\nThe second day began with the opening keynote. Later went to the Jenkins X Introduction, Deploying K8s with Jenkins on GCP, Build top mobile games\nby King in that order. Also occasionally hitting the sponsors booth to have a chat and collect some swags. In the evening there was the superhero\nthemed party, sponsored by Sonatype. It was probably the most fun event in the entire conference. The expo hall had an entirely different look with the party lights on,\npeople wearing capes, fun events going around. There were artists dressed in a Bumblebee, a Batman, a Superman, a Supergirl, a Thor and more superhero\ncostumes! I was previously made aware of the interesting parties at Jenkins World but the experience was very different. People from all over the world had\ncome together to celebrate the 15 years of success of an open source software. After partying from 5 to 7 we went back to the hotel. I spent some time\nto prepare the slides for the next day’s presentation and went to bed.\n\nDay 3 (Dec 5)\n\nThe third and final day of conference began with Jenkins World Fun Run. I missed the keynote for being late and other setup required for the\npresentation. My laptop was broken so had to do all the setup for demo on a friend’s laptop. The situation felt like a Jenkins admin under fire\nfor a production bug. After being under pressure for a while, took a break to admire the developer comics and had a chat with the graffiti painter.\nDuring lunch it was time for the GSoC presentation at the Jenkins community booth. All our presentation went well and we also interacted with real users.\nThen we had the GSoC Team pic at the Jenkins community booth. Later Abhyudaya and me gave our presentation at the lightning talks as well upon Mark Waite’s\nrequest. The event concluded with emotional goodbyes.\n\nAll GSoC Students were invited for dinner at Corinthia Lisboa’s Soul Garden restaurant. The party comprised of Oleg, Mark and his lovely wife, Liam, Tracy,\nAlyssa and Olivier. We had a very nice conversation and I had a very delicious Bacalhau (cod fish) dish. Then bid final goodbye to everybody.\n\nIt was a wonderful experience in a wonderful country among wonderful people. Hats off to the management team lead by Alyssa Tong and co. An event this big was\ncarried out without any hiccups! Everybody contributed their part to the event which made it very interactive and fun. Checkout some of my swags:\n\nA big shout out to the Jenkins project and CloudBees for sponsoring this trip. Also thank you Jenkins and Google Summer of Code for support. :)","title":"My DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon Experience","tags":["gitlab","devopsworld","jenkinsworld","gsoc","gsoc2019"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/20305/baymac.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/eb017/baymac.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/ed0e7/baymac.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/20305/baymac.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/b3c75/baymac.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/bcdad/baymac.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/21187/baymac.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/33025/baymac.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/f0b1fd16f8bec9a14b57a0b0108486f1/d386c/baymac.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":192}}},"blog":null,"github":"baymac","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>GSoC 2019 student under Jenkins project.

I had an early morning flight to Lisbon\nfrom Delhi via Istanbul. At the Airport, I met Parichay who had been\nwaiting there from his connecting flight. After flying 8000 km, we\nreached Lisbon. We took a taxi to the hotel and were greeted there by\none of my Google Summer of Code mentors, Oleg. After four months of\nworking with him on my GSoC project, meeting him was an amazing\nexperience. Later that day, after stretching our legs in the hotel, we\nmet Long for an early dinner, who came to the hotel after exploring much\nof Lisbon.\n\nDay 1: Hackfest, December 2\n\nNext morning, we all met for breakfast where we all got to taste some\nPastel de Nata. We then took a cab to the Congress Centre for attending\nthe Jenkins and Jenkins X hackfest. At the Hackfest, I met Mark, Joseph,\nKasper, Andrey and other Jenkins contributors. I also met Oleg, this\ntime together with his son and his wife. After our introductions, and a\nshort presentation by Oleg, I started hacking on the Folder Auth plugin\nand made it possible to delete user sids from roles. The best part of\nhacking there was to get instant feedback on what I was working on. More\nand more people kept coming throughout the day. It was great to see so\nmany people working hard to improve Jenkins. At the end, everyone\npresented what they had achieved that day. Having skipped lunch for some\nsnacks, Oleg and others tried hard to get some pizza delivered without\nmuch success. After the Hackfest, everyone was hungry and most attendees\nincluding me went looking for nearby restaurants. Since it was early and\nmost restaurants were not open yet, we all decided to have burgers. It\nwas a great learning experience listening to and talking about Jenkins,\nElasticsearch, Jira, GitHub and a lot of other things. After that, we\ntook a taxi back to the hotel and I went to bed.\n\nDay 2: Contributor Summit, December 3\n\nWe had the Jenkins and Jenkins X contributor summit the next day. Me and\nParichay took the bus to the Congress Centre in the morning. After\nregistration, I got my ‘Speaker’ badge and the conference T-shirt. The\ncontributor summit took place in the same hall as the Hackfest, but the\nseating arrangement was completely different and there were a lot more\npeople. The summit started with everyone introducing themselves. It\nturned out that there were a lot of people from Munich. There were\npresentations and talks about all things Jenkins, Jenkins X and the\nContinuous Delivery Foundation by Kohsuke, Oleg, Joseph, Liam, Olivier,\nWadek and others. I had no experience with Jenkins X which made the\nsummit very interesting. After lunch, the talks were over, and everyone\nwas free to join any session discussing various things about Jenkins. I\nattended the Cloud Native Jenkins and the Configuration-as-Code\nsessions.\n\nWhile some of the conference attendees were in the Contributor summit,\nthe others were going through certifications and trainings. At around 5\no’clock in the evening, the summit and the trainings all got over and\nthe expo hall was thrown open. On the entrance, there was a large stack\nof big DWJW bags. I did not realize why those bags were kept there.\nSince everyone was taking one, I took one as well. As soon as I went\ninto the hall, I realized that those bags were for collecting swag. I\nhad never seen anything like this where sponsors were just giving away\nT-shirts, stickers and other stuff. There were snacks and Kohsuke was\ncutting the extremely tasty 15 years of Jenkins cake. After having the\ncake, I went on a swag-collecting spree going from one sponsor booth to\nthe other. This was an amazing experience, not only was I able to get\ncool stuff, I was also able to learn a lot about the software these\ncompanies made and how it fits into the DevOps pipeline.\n\nAfter the conference got over, me, Long and Parichay went to the Lisbon\nMariott Hotel for the Eurodog party. After collecting another T-shirt, I\nwent to the nearest restaurant (McDonald’s) with Andrey who I had\nearlier met at the Hackfest.\n\nDay 3: December 4\n\nThis was the first official day of the conference and it began with the\nkeynote. There were over 900 people in the keynote hall. It was amazing\nto see so many people attending the conference. After the keynote got\nover, I went to several sessions throughout the day learning about how\ncompanies are using Jenkins and implementing DevOps tools.\n\nIn the evening, we had the Sonatype Superparty which was a lot of fun.\nThere were neon lights, arcade machines, VR experiences, superheroes and\nmore swag. There was a lot of good food including pizzas and burgers and\nhot dogs. Superhero inspired desserts were very interesting. I was able\nto talk to Oleg and Wadek about the security challenges in Jenkins.\nDuring the party, I also got a chance to meet the CEO of CloudBees,\nSacha Labourey.\n\nDay 4, December 5\n\nThis was the last day of the conference and it began with another\nkeynote. After the keynote, I attended a very interesting talk on how\nthe European Observatory built software for large telescopes using\nJenkins. After that, I prepared for my talk on the work I did during\nGoogle Summer of Code 2019. I had my presentation in the community booth\nduring the lunch time. Presenting in front of real people was an amazing\nexperience and very different from the ones we had on Zoom chats for our\nGSoC evaluations. In the evening, I got another chance to present my\nproject at the Jenkins Community Lightning Talks.\n\nAfter that, the conference came to an end and I went back to the hotel.\nAfter relaxing for some time, me, Parichay and Long were invited by Oleg\nto a dinner at Corinthia Hotel with Kohsuke, Mark and his wife, Tracy,\nAlyssa, and Liam. Unfortunately, Long couldn’t attend the dinner because\nhe had the flight back earlier that evening. After the amazing dinner, I\nthanked everyone for such an amazing trip and said goodbye.\n\nDWJW was the best experience I’ve ever had. I was able to learn about a\nlot of new things and talk to some amazing people. In the end, I would\nlike to especially thank Oleg for helping me throughout and making it\npossible for me to attend such a wonderful conference. I would like to\nthank my other mentors Runze Xia and Supun for their support in my\nGoogle Summer of Code project. I would like to thank Google for\norganizing Google Summer of Code, everyone at Jenkins project for\nsponsoring my travel, and CloudBees for inviting me to the conference.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you all again soon!","title":"Trip to DevOps World | Jenkins World","tags":["gsoc","gsoc2019","devopsworld","jenkinsworld","events","community"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/ff5b9/abhyudayasharma.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/f4523/abhyudayasharma.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/1e7bb/abhyudayasharma.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/ff5b9/abhyudayasharma.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/b48b6/abhyudayasharma.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/1fd06/abhyudayasharma.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/9edd6/abhyudayasharma.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/f5f75/abhyudayasharma.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/a1ce355d937f34af4ad5cbf6a6d79f30/05d06/abhyudayasharma.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":142}}},"blog":null,"github":"AbhyudayaSharma","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Abhyudaya is a Computer Science student at Shiv Nadar University, India.\nHe is participating in Google Summer of Code 2019 to improve the performance\nof the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin\">Role Strategy Plugin</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"abhyudayasharma","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Abhyudaya Sharma","slug":"/blog/authors/abhyudayasharma","twitter":null}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","id":"c4402fa6-fa64-5bd5-9fce-956f048b190a","slug":"/blog/2019/11/29/do-plugins-store-credentials-in-a-secure-way/","strippedHtml":"This is a speaker blog post for a DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 talk in Lisbon, Portugal and has been posted in line with NCC Group responsible disclosure policy.\nRelated Jenkins security advisories:\n2017-11-08,\n2017-11-16,\n2018-06-25,\n2018-07-30,\n2018-09-25,\n2019-02-19,\n2019-03-06,\n2019-03-25,\n2019-04-03,\n2019-04-17,\n2019-08-07,\n2019-09-12,\n2019-10-01,\n2019-10-16,\n2019-10-23.\nSome of the vulnerabilities have been announced without a fix, see Jenkins Security Spring Cleaning 2019.\nThe most of the announced vulnerabilities are fixed at the moment of this blogpost publishing.\n\nCome join us at DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 for \" The Story, the Findings and the Fixes Behind More than 100 Jenkins Plugins Vulnerabilities \", a talk about the most common vulnerabilities found during research in more than 100 plugins.\nWe’ll review how to prevent these vulnerabilities during plugin development so that a more secure Jenkins CI and CD environment can be built.\n\nWhen I first began familiarising myself with Jenkins, I found myself almost overwhelmed by the amount of plugins to choose from. Most of these plugins are developed by third party developers or companies and can assist the user in a range of ways. They can extend the core functions, they can offer solutions to repetitive tasks or they can help with using a service. For example, they could help with publishing to an artifact store or spinning up cloud instances. However, before a plugin can use a network based service that requires credentials to connect, those credentials have to be typed in and saved somewhere. This raises the question, are those credentials stored securely? Or not?\nWhen I started looking at different plugins this was one of the first areas I investigated. I found a Jenkins security advisory describing this issue and came to the conclusion that this could be a problem in some plugins, albeit one that could be fixed easily. I found an example of weakly stored credentials in the Publish Over Dropbox Plugin; this plugin used a simple web form with a textbox element to display the token in the plugin’s settings page. This token was stored in plaintext:\n\nThe following Jelly code was behind the web form and shows that a password field wasn’t used:\n\nThe related plugin .xml file contained the secret key in plaintext:\n\nGLOBAL\nwoodspeed\n\nlYD2VnNz\nlYD2VnNz\n\nJenkins offers at least two ways to store credentials in an encrypted format:\n\nUsing a Secret type offered by Jenkins\n\nThird party plugin called Credentials Plugin\n\nThe first case is the easiest solution, because Jenkins will automatically handle the encryption and decryption.\n\nDevelopers should also use the password field tag instead of the textbox field, as shown in the following Jelly control example:\n\nIf you would like to know what other vulnerabilities I discovered and how to fix them, come and join us for the presentation in Lisbon!\nIn case you are unable to attend the conference, you can read more at Story of a Hundred Vulnerable Jenkins Plugins.","title":"Do Plugins Store Credentials In A Secure Way? - DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019","tags":["jenkins world","jenkinsworld","devopsworld2019","security"],"authors":[{"avatar":null,"blog":null,"github":"woodspeed","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Viktor is a security consultant and the 2019 Jenkins Security MVP.</p>\n</div>","id":"woodspeed","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Viktor Gazdag","slug":"/blog/authors/woodspeed","twitter":"wucpi"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","id":"d7cd86a9-cbed-5942-90a0-dd192dcd3459","slug":"/blog/2019/11/04/speaker-blog-how-to-build-the-top-mobile-game/","strippedHtml":"Context\n\nYou have been tasked with managing the Jenkins instance for the highest grossing mobile\ngame in the world. You learn that this involves helping the game studio iterate their work\nagainst eight different target platforms, each with their SDK, on four different main pipelines,\nplus a lot of extra auxiliary jobs. And, of course, the studio wants all of this to go smoothly, in\norder to maintain a good pace of features and bugfixes for every release - a release happening\nevery two weeks. Hitting hundreds of millions of players worldwide.\n\nHow are you going to make sure that the environment stays correctly configured, with the\nright versions of the required software; helping the studio maintain stability and scalability of\ntheir pipelines; ensuring operability of the Jenkins instance; improving the speed of the builds\nmonth after month?\n\nIt’s OK to sweat. You are going to need some help!\n\nThis is just a regular day in the office for a build engineer working at King. Facing a very\nbroad problem, with high quality standards and even higher stakes. Thankfully, we are not\nalone. We have access to a lot of tools - either open source tools, tools developed by the\nstudios or tools developed by our stellar build infrastructure team in Barcelona - to help carry\nus all the way to the publish line. We put all of these tools together, and by their powers\ncombined, we provide fast, easily operable workflows for the studios, cutting minutes here\nand there, ensuring the features a smooth sail from dev, to master, to release.\n\nI will explain all of the tricks we use at King to speed builds up, and to make Jenkins operation\neasier for our studios on December 4, 2019, at DevOps World | Jenkins\nWorld Lisbon.\nUse JWFOSS for 30% discount on registration!\nFor now, let’s take a look at some of them.\n\nWhere do we start?\n\nWe use on-premises elastic infrastructure, spawning machines from certain templates\nwhenever they are needed. This means that for every build, we are getting a fresh\nenvironment - no intermediate artifacts leftover or anything of the sort, which is good. That\nalso means that we need to clone our repositories and compile everything every time, which is\nbad. However, we have solutions for these two problems.\n\nWe make full use of linkclones/snapshots when spawning a VM. Every night we run a\nbootstrapper that will power on the base image and perform whatever operations we decide on\nit, before turning it back into a template and re-creating the snapshot. In the case of Candy\nCrush, we update our caches, and this helps us cut some time off of git clone and compilation.\nWe call this bootstrapper “cacheo”. It looks more or less like this:\n\nCacheo\n\n1. Start elastic agent template image\n2. Connect it to Jenkins\n3. Perform cleanup\n4. Trigger git reference cache jobs\n5. Trigger all the builds you want cached\n6. Turn off template image, delete the agent and recreate the linked clone snapshot\n\nEvery studio can specify on which templates will cacheo run, and what will it do in each of them.\nMaybe you want to make sure your Android license is on point. Or download some\npackages from artifactory. Perhaps pre-load your gradle dependencies. Whatever it is, cacheo\ndoes it for you and updates your base images every night.\n\nOne of the most common uses is to pre-fill a local git cache, and when doing so, the\nimprovement is very visible, especially on Windows:\n\nLinux\nMacOS\nWindows\n\nNFS\n2 min 11s\n2min 34s\n8min 32s\n\nLocal\n1 min 20s\n1min 35s\n3min 49s\n\nDifference\n39% faster\n39% faster\n55% faster\n\nThis means, speeding up source code fetching by 55% on Windows, on average. That is a LOT!!\n\nBut what about actual compilation?\n\nAll of our major games use the same engine; we bring this code in by means of submodules. This means\nthere is a big bunch of shared code that needs to be compiled and linked whenever we build the game.\nAnd it’s not rare that this shared code is bigger than the actual game code!\nThankfully, the engine team lent us a hand, and they developed a way to package the compiled shared code.\nNormally, the game code lives alongside a specific version of the shared code, which doesn’t get updated too frequently.\nSometimes once a month, sometimes to grab a hotfix. This translates to us potentially compiling the\nexact same shared code for quite some time, every time we build the game. Thanks to these\nprebuilt artifacts, we are able to skip a huge part of the compilation, at the cost of a simple artifactory download.\n\nCacheo\n\nif generate_prebuilt_libs:\n    compile_project()\n\n    generate_empty_cmakelists()\n\n    for dependency in dependencies:\n        merge_compiled_dependency_into_metalib(dependency)\n        write_dependency_to_generated_cmakelists_as_alias_for_metalib(dependency)\n\nelif use_prebuilt_libs:\n    add_generated_cmakelists_with_metalib_as_dependency()\n\n    compile_project()\n\nThanks to these prebuilt libraries, we are able to skip a big chunk of the compilation,\nand it builds up really quickly! Iterative work on several branches, as long as they have\nthe same engine version, gets sped up in noticeable ways.\nThere are, however, specific cases when we do choose to build the shared code regardless, such as\nwhen we build release candidates for instance.\n\nJust so you get an idea, times on this table are on average:\n\niOS\nWindows\n\nNo prebuilts\n20min 17s\n40min 30s\n\nPrebuilts\n10min 2s\n23min 20s\n\nDifference\n51% faster\n43% faster\n\nI just don’t want to have to deal with bureaucracy\n\nOperating Jenkins can be quite complicated. Talk about “Tell me\nsomething I don’t know”, right? And with so many moving pieces (elastic\ninfrastructure, plugins, dirty workspaces), it might not be easy for\neveryone to run specific maintenance tasks. We have a lot of small\npipelines, created by the build infrastructure group, that we can use to\ndiagnose and work around certain errors, as well as gather useful\ninformation that might be otherwise difficult to find. These pipelines\ndo things like printing all the installed plugins, deleting offline\non-demand agents, cleaning disconnected VMs from vSphere, or re-run\npuppet in a specific Jenkins instance. And any user can run these jobs,\nthere is no need to be an admin. This allows the team to unblock\nthemselves if they need to by using these jobs. Here’s one that I\nparticularly like. How many times have you modified a pipeline and, when\ntrying to run it, the first thing that happens is that Jenkins says that\nit needs approval?\n\nScript Approval\n\nimport org.jenkinsci.plugins.scriptsecurity.scripts.*\n\n@NonCPS\n\n// Disclaimer - this can have serious security consequences\n// Be mindful when you run this!\n\ndef call() {\n    sa = ScriptApproval.get()\n    toApproveScripts = sa.getPendingScripts().collect()\n    println (\"toApproveScripts: \" + toApproveScripts)\n    toApproveScripts.each {pending ->\n        sa.get().approveScript(pending.getHash())\n\tprintln (\"approvedScripts: \" + pending.getHash())\n\t}\n    sa.save()\n}\n\nThe best part? All our Jenkins instances include these jobs, by default, so\nno one misses out on the fun.","title":"How to build the top mobile game for every platform imaginable","tags":["jenkinsworld","jenkinsworld2019","mobile-game"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#483838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/19e71/ignacio_fernandez.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/77b35/ignacio_fernandez.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/d4a57/ignacio_fernandez.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/19e71/ignacio_fernandez.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/68974/ignacio_fernandez.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/ef6ff/ignacio_fernandez.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/8257c/ignacio_fernandez.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/6766a/ignacio_fernandez.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/65fe0ac3c5bb3e4da27248b175dc5c31/22bfc/ignacio_fernandez.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"Napo2k","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Nacho is a Build Engineer with several years of experience in the videogame industry, and has worked in both AAA projects as well as free-to-play and mobile.\nCurrently, Nacho works at King Stockholm, taking care of Jenkins operations for Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga.</p>\n</div>","id":"ignacio_fernandez","irc":null,"linkedin":"ignaciofernandezpuerta","name":"Ignacio 'Nacho' Fernández","slug":"/blog/authors/ignacio_fernandez","twitter":"@napo2k"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2019-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":"09c19419-deb1-5016-ab06-4383186a37e4","slug":"/blog/2019/11/01/devops-world-jenkins-world-san-francisco-in-living-colors/","strippedHtml":"DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco was August 12 -

turns 15 years old!\nJenkins World brings together DevOps thought leaders, IT executives, continuous delivery practitioners and the Jenkins\ncommunity and ecosystem in one global event, providing attendees with the opportunity to learn, explore, network\nface-to-face and help shape the next evolution of Jenkins development and solutions for DevOps.\n\nThere is also the Jenkins Contributor Summit in San Francisco. The Jenkins Contributor Summit is the place where\ncurrent and future contributors get together to discuss, learn and collaborate on the latest and greatest efforts within\nJenkins project. The morning portion of the summit is a mix of presentations by the core contributors. The\npresentations highlight what each effort is about and what community members can do to help. In the\nafternoon breakout sessions with  Birds of a Feather tables for in-depth discussion, and collaboration with sub-project\ncontributors.\n\nI feel very honored to have been a part of this.\n\nDay 1\n\nDay one started with the contributor summit. This was a chance for everyone to get together and talk about\ncontributions and put faces to names. Most people I had only met via video chat or on gitter so I was super excited.\nWe gathered to hear about the start of the Jenkins open source landscape.\n\nNext up was the BoF/Unconference. I was leading these sessions and I felt they went really well.\nWe had fellow org admins Martin d’Anjou and Jeff Pearce give a talk about Google Summer of Code projects.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code student Natasha Stopa presented her project, Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool. This is\na super cool project and very well received in the community.\n\nWe closed out the session with a presentation from Steven Terrana from Booz Allen Hamilton and the awesome Jenkins\nTemplating Engine. If you have not had a chance to try this, please make sure you do at https://github.com/boozallen/jenkins-templating-engine.\n\nMain Expo Hall\n\nDay two and onward saw me and other Jenkins org admins in the Ask the Expert booth for the Jenkins community.\n\nThis was a really cool experience and gave me a chance to hear about things the community is working on and help with\nissues they are facing.\nThere were a range of questions from Jenkins X to many of the plugins I maintain such and the Jenkins Prometheus and the\nSysdig Secure Scanning plugins.\nThere were also a lot of Kubernetes questions. There is a lot of marketing data regarding the increased usage of\nKubernetes but I was seriously surprised by the massive interest in Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nOf course there were opportunities for selfie requests.\n\nLunch time demos got underway and we had a busy schedule.\nFirst up was the awesome Mark Waite to talk about the\nGit plugin. A lot of people use git in\nJenkins.\nThank you so much for all that you do Mark.\n\nJenkins org admin Martin d’Anjou was next on deck to talk about the Google Summer of Code. So amazing to think that the\nGoogle Summer of Code is also in its 15th year like Jenkins!\n\nNatasha Stopa is a Google Summer of Code student and she presented her project Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool.\nNatasha really put a lot of hard work in to this plugin and it was really awesome to see the turn out and support during\nher presentation.\n\nFinally there was me. I presented the Sysdig Secure Scanning Jenkins plugin which I am a maintainer of. I thank everyone who attended\n\nRight after the lunch time demos I also oversaw the Jenkins open space. This was an opportunity for the community to talk\nabout items and let them flow organically. I really enjoyed this session and felt it was also well received.\n\nWe closed out the day and the event with a picture of some of the Jenkins org admins and Google Summer of Code students.\nMissing from this photos are fellow org admins, Lloyd Chang and Oleg Nenashev\n\nClosing\n\nThis was an amazing experience. Huge thanks to CloudBees, the Jenkins community, Google Summer of Code, Tracy Miranda,\nAlyssa Tong and my employer Sysdig.\n\nTo think Jenkins is 15 years old is amazing!
