community congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!\nLet’s take a look at some changes this year.\nWe would like to thank all awesome Jenkins users and contributors who have been with us during this year.\n\nHighlights\n\nSome of the key highlights:\n\nHundreds of first-timer contributors joined the community\n\nMajor UI/UX improvements in the Jenkins core, including the landing page, plugin manager, dark theme, and read-only configurations support\n\nOutreach programs like Google Summer of Code (7 projects), Google Season of Docs, UI/UX hackfest, etc.\n\nPublic roadmap for the project\n\nTerminology changes in the project, new Code of Conduct\n\nTechnical debt cleanup: XStream unforking, Acegi Security replacement, etc.\n\nContinued evolution of the plugin ecosystem, especially in the area of Cloud Native solutions and tool integrations\n\nContinued documentation cleanup, great progress with plugin documentation migration\n\nGraduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins User Interface and User Experience\n\nThis year there were many activities around Jenkins user experience and long-anticipated user interface changes.\nThis is a coordinated effort being led by the User Experience SIG, and by many contributors to the project.\nKey project highlights:\n\nLook & Feel updates of the Jenkins Web UI, including styling rework, new typography and layouts\n\nMajor rework of plugin management UI/UX\n\nDark theme for Jenkins\n\nAccessibility improvements\n\nSupport for read-only configuration pages\n\nIn May we also organized a Jenkins UI/UX hackfest where we worked on some key stories improving user experience.\n\nJenkins security\n\nIn 2020 the Jenkins security team has released 19 advisories for the Jenkins core, plugins and other components.\nIn total 198 vulnerabilities were fixed, and 72 plugin vulnerabilities were announced without a fix at the time of advisory publishing.\nAs a project, we are receiving a continuous flow of new reports and continue to provide corrections.\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were the most popular type this year, followed by unprotected credentials.\n\nThere have also been developer tooling improvements,\nincluding GitHub CodeQL evaluation for targeted security issues search\nand Find-Sec-Bugs adoption for static analysis of the plugin and Jenkins core code.\nAlong with wider adoption of Dependabot and automated dependency scanning on GitHub.\n\nDocumentation\n\nJenkins Documentation SIG is working on creating more documentation for Jenkins on different platforms,\nincluding cloud platforms.\nJenkins on Kubernetes was one of the key stories this year for the SIG,\nalong with documentation migration to jenkins.io and wider adoption of Documentation-as-code in plugins.\n95% of the 200 most installed Jenkins plugins have moved to \"documentation as code\" or have a pending pull request with updates.\nIn total, almost 600 plugins have already been migrated.\nThere were major updates in Jenkins documentation on jenkins.io, with a lot of content being moved from the old Jenkins Wiki.\n\n2020 was the first year when Jenkins participated in Google Season of Docs (GSoD).\nThis program brings together open-source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.\nThis year’s student, Zainab Abubakar,\ndid an amazing job documenting Jenkins on Kubernetes.\nNow Jenkins users can find official documentation about deploying and scaling Jenkins in Kubernetes.\nSee the project report by Zainab here.\n\nJenkins Release Automation\n\nThe Jenkins project has delivered weekly and long term support releases since it was formed in 2011.\nThose releases were delivered by Kohsuke Kawaguchi from his release infrastructure.\n\nBeginning in April 2020, those releases are delivered by the new release automation setup.\nIt is hosted within the Jenkins’ Kubernetes cluster, with fully automated management and continuous delivery of services within the setup.\nWe transitioned to new build processes, new code signing certificates, and new release automation jobs.\nThanks to Olivier Vernin and all Infrastructure sub-project contributors for the successful completion of the release automation project!\n\nMoreover, there is ongoing work on continuous delivery of Jenkins plugins ( JEP-229) and on re-designing other Jenkins instances within the project (infra-ci, trusted-ci, and ci.jenkins.io for plugins).\nIn the next few months these stories should provide Jenkins contributors with a modern environment for CI and CD of all Jenkins components.\n\nTerminology updates\n\nSince July, we have officially replaced the old \"master\" terminology with the \"controller\" term.\nIt is a follow-up to the \"agent\" terminology introduced in 2016.\nWe have also deprecated usages of the “blacklist/whitelist” terminology in all components.\nCurrently the community is working on the cleanup of the remaining occurrences in the codebase and documentation, and we invite everyone to contribute.\n\nAs a part of the terminology cleanup, last spring we announced the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.\nAs a reminder, it does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users, but they are expected to gradually upgrade their instances.\n\nSee more information about terminology updates here and here.\n\n“Jenkins is the Way” program\n\nThis year the Advocacy and Outreach SIG started the “Jenkins is the Way” initiative which focuses on promoting user success stories.\nOver the year, the team published 54 user stories and six case studies on https://jenkinsistheway.io/ as well as a significant amount of community marketing.\nWe also published a number of testimonial videos advertising user stories,\nincluding this Introduction to \"Jenkins is the Way\" video.\n\nSee all the stories HERE\n\nEvents\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nIn 2020 we had seven students working in the Jenkins mentoring organization.\nWe had 6 projects focused on Jenkins and one project focused on Jenkins X.\nAs usual, in GSoC we focused on problems important to the Jenkins users and community members.\nThe projects delivered highly anticipated new features and key architecture changes needed for the long-term evolution of Jenkins.\n\nThis is the first-ever time in Jenkins when all GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed it.\nIt was an incredible effort by all the project members and, most importantly, by the students. Thanks a lot to them!\n\nRead more: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/22/gsoc-report/\n\nJenkins in Hacktoberfest 2020\n\nIn October we participated in Hacktoberfest.\nOur featured projects included the Jenkins core, jenkins.io website and plugins.jenkins.io, Helm charts, and multiple plugins.\nWe also encouraged contributors to participate in the Documentation as Code and terminology cleanup across the entire Jenkins ecosystem.\n\nSee the details in the Hacktoberfest page.\n\nIn total we received 226 pull requests from Hacktoberfest participants.\nSome stats per Jenkins GitHub organization:\n\n'jenkinsci', PRs: 189, Hacktoberfest contributors: 61\n\n'jenkins-infra', PRs: 100, Hacktoberfest contributors: 40\n\n'jenkins-zh', PRs: 37, Hacktoberfest contributors: 2\n\nJenkins at DevOps World\n\nThe annual DevOps World,\nformerly known as DevOps World | Jenkins World held on Sept 22-24, with workshops on Sept 25.\nJust like other events in 2020, DevOps World pivoted to a virtual event but that didn’t mean there was a shortage of sessions or networking opportunities. There were over 50 Jenkins/open-source.\nAnd a special congratulations is in order to this year’s Jenkins Contributor Award winners:\n\nJames Holderness - Jenkins security MVP\n\nMarky Jackson - Most valuable Jenkins advocate\n\nTim Jacomb - Most valuable Jenkins contributor\n\nBelow are just a few sessions, the full agenda can be found HERE :\n\nJenkins Where It Is and Where It Is Going\n\nOne Jenkins to Rule them All\n\nJenkins UI Gets a Makeover\n\nJenkins Pipeline and DevSecOps for API Security\n\nGraduation at Continuous Delivery Foundation\n\nJenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.\nIn August the project announced that the Jenkins project has achieved the graduated status in the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).\nThanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!\nBelow you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:\n\nWe introduced a new public roadmap for the Jenkins project.\nThis roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.\nIt makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters, and at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.\nThe roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in JEP-14.\n\nA new list of Jenkins adopters was introduced on jenkins.io.\nThis list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,\nincluding ones submitted through the Jenkins Is The Way portal.\nPlease do not hesitate to add your company there!\n\nWe passed the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification.\nThis certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices and to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).\nIt also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.\nDetails are on the Jenkins core page.\n\nJenkins Code of Conduct was updated to the new version of Contributor Covenant.\nIn particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.\n\nMore information can be found HERE, and HERE.\n\nPublic Roadmap\n\nThe Jenkins project now has a public, community-driven project roadmap.  Roadmap items are major initiatives and are considered as official plans.\nThe roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all areas of the project.\n\nMany of the 2020 released roadmap items are mentioned elsewhere in this document, including release automation, Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) certification,\nuser interface improvements, read-only configuration pages,\nand Google Summer of Code projects like the GitHub Checks API or External Fingerprint Storage.\n\nOther roadmap items include mirror infrastructure improvements, a new Windows installer,\nand preview releases of pluggable storage for external fingerprints, build logs, and unit test results.\n\nJenkins 2020 Elections\n\nIn October-December the Jenkins community held the regular elections.\nThis year we were  electing for 2 governance board members and for all five officer positions, namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation. These roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being. We thank all candidates and voters who participated this year.\n\nKey results:\n\nGavin Mogan and Marky Jackson joined the Jenkins Governance Board\n\nTim Jacomb was elected as Release Officer\n\nMarky Jackson became the new Events Officer\n\nOlivier Vernin, Daniel Beck, and Mark Waite will continue as Infrastructure, Security and Documentation officers\n\nFull election results: https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/12/03/election-results/\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project,\nit is just a slice of the key highlights mentioned by the contributors.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day. We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size. Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc. THANKS A LOT TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTechnical changes. 2021 will be another busy year for the Jenkins community.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want Jenkins to succeed.\nThere are many areas on the roadmap : UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nThere will also be a continued cleanup of old dependencies and technical debt.\nSeveral key changes are expected to land in the March LTS baseline: update to Spring Security, XStream unforking, JQuery update, etc.( announcement).\nIn addition to that, we will keep working on expanding platform support in Jenkins, including provisioning support for new Java versions and official images for more architectures like Arm.\n\nDocumentation. Documentation efforts will continue in the next year,\nwith a focus on documenting Jenkins usage on modern platforms and and automation use-cases.\nWide adoption of documentation-as-code will also continue for plugins By this time almost 600 plugins have been migrated, but there are hundreds more plugins to go.\n\nSecurity. Another important area is Jenkins security. Automation tools like Jenkins are a key part of the software delivery process in organizations, and their security is essential for the security of products.\nMisconfigured or outdated systems are a common attack vector, but there are also areas for improvement on the project’s side.\nBe sure there will be security advisories and vulnerability fixes in 2021.\nWe plan to keep adopting best security development and software delivery practices, and to improve dependency management and developer tools in the project. These areas will be in the spotlight for the project next year.\n\nEvents. Next month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a virtual Jenkins stand there.\nThere will also be a CI/CD devroom.\nIf you are interested to meet Jenkins contributors, it is a great opportunity. We also plan to continue all outreach programs and on onboarding more contributors.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement).\nWe are also ready to consider other non-coding project ideas as a part of CommunityBridge.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nJoin us in 2021!\n\nWe are always looking for more contributors, regardless of the profile and experience.\nJenkins is a vast ecosystem which includes many modern technologies.\n\nWe invite Jenkins users and contributors to participate in the community and to move these initiatives forward!\nJoin us in the mailing lists and special interest groups,","title":"2020 A Year Like No Other","tags":["community","new-year-blogpost","governance"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"markyjackson-taulia","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hi!

project congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!\nLet’s take a look at some changes this year.\n\nHighlights\n\nWe celebrated 15 years of Jenkins\n\nWe had first ever Governance Board and Officer elections\n\nJenkins project joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)\n\nWe released Java 11 support in Jenkins\n\nJenkins X has graduated as a Jenkins sub-project and became a new project under umbrella of CDF\n\nIn October 2019 we reached the record high number of contributions: 915 unique contributors, 124 of them were first-timers\n\nWe started new special interest groups for Documentation and User Experience.\n\nA new position of the Documentation officer was introduced to highlight an important role of documentation in the project\n\nWe ran multiple mentorship programs with 12 mentees in total: Google Summer of Code, Hacktoberfest and Outreachy\n\nIf you are interested to know more about Jenkins features introduced in 2019,\nstay tuned for a separate blog post about it (coming soon!).\n\nProject updates\n\nHighlights above do not cover all advancements we had in the project.\nBelow you can find slides from the Jenkins contributor summit in Lisbon.\nThere we had project updates by officers, SIG and sub-project leaders.\nSee the slide deck to know about: Jenkins Core, Pipeline, Configuration-as-Code, Security, UX Overhaul, Jenkins Infrastructure, platform support and documentation.\n\nSome stats and numbers\n\nIf this section seems to be too long for you, here is some infographic prepared by Tracy Miranda.\nAs you may see, Jenkins is pretty big :)\n\nCommunity.\nOver the past year we had 5433 contributors in GitHub repositories (committers, reviewers, issue submitters, etc.).\nWe had 1892 unique committers who created 7122 pull requests and 45484 commits, bots excluded.\nContributors represent 273 companies and 111 countries, 8% of contributors are recognized as independent.\nThe most active repositories were Jenkins Core and jenkins.io.\nThe most active month was October 2019 when we reached the record high number of contributions: 915 unique contributors, 124 of them were first-timers, thanks to Hacktoberfest!.\n\nJenkins core.\nIn 2019 Jenkins core had 54 weekly and 13 LTS releases with several hundreds of notable fixes/enhancements.\nThere was a login screen extensibility rework, many update manager and administrative monitors improvements.\nWe also introduced support for user timezones, not speaking of emojis support 🥳.\nThere was also a lot of housekeeping work: better APIs, codebase refresh, cleaning up static analysis warnings and removing deprecated features like Remoting CLI.\nThe core’s components also got major updates.\nOnly Jenkins Remoting got 11 releases with stability improvements and new features like support of inbound connections to headless Jenkins controllers.\nThere are also major incoming features like jep:222[WebSocket Services support], UI look&feel updates, jira:JENKINS-12548[Readonly system configuration support], Docker images for new platforms like Arm.\nTo facilitate further changes we created a new Core pull request reviewers team and added 9 contributors there.\n\nPlugins.\nThere were 2654 plugin releases, and 157 NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.\nJenkins ecosystem got a lot of new integrations with Development and DevOps tools.\nAlso, warm welcome back to the Scriptler Plugin which was depublished in 2017 due to security issues.\nIf you are afraid about such plugin numbers and dependency management, there is a new Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool which should help Jenkins users to manage plugins more efficiently.\n\nSecurity.\nIt was a hot year for the Jenkins Security Team.\nThere were 5 security advisories for the core and 20 - for plugins.\nIn total we disclosed 288 vulnerabilities across the project, including some backlog cleaning for unmaintained plugins.\nScript Security Plugin was the hottest plugin with 10 critical fixes addressing various sandbox bypass vulnerabilities.\nPlain text storage and unprotected credentials were the most popular vulnerability type 120 disclosures in 2019.\nIt was made possible by hundreds of reports submitted by contributors after code surveys,\nspecial thanks to Viktor Gazdag who reported the most of the issues and became the Jenkins 2019 Security MVP (check out his story here).\n\nInfrastructure.\nGot Jenkins? If so, you rely on Jenkins update centers, website and issue tracker.\nAll these and many other services are maintained by the Jenkins Infrastructure Team.\nThis year the team handled more than 400 requests in the bugtracker, and many other informal requests.\nIn total, more than 30 people contributed to Jenkins infrastructure this year (website content is excluded).\nWe also deployed 4 new services, migrated 7 services from Azure Container Service to Azure Kubernetes Service and updated many other services.\nMore changes will happen in the next months, and we are looking for new INFRA team members!\n\nDocumentation.\nOnly last quarter we had 178 contributors to Jenkins documentation. It includes jenkins.io and other documentation hosted on GitHub, Wiki is not included.\nThere is also ongoing migration plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub ( announcement).\nSince the beginning of the project in Sep 2019, more than 150 plugin were migrated, and they got significant documentation revamp during the migration.\nYou can see the current status here.\nWe also work on introducing changelog automation in the project.\n123 plugins have already adopted the new changelog tools, powered by Release Drafter.\nAlso, we had more than 60 technical blog posts published on jenkins.io.\n\nConfiguration as Code was one of the most popular areas this year.\nJenkins Configuration as Code Plugin had more than 30 releases with new features and bug fixes.\nMore than 50 plugins have been also updated in order to offer better configuration-as-code support.\nAs a result, the JCasC Plugin got massive adoption this year (from 2000 to almost 8000 installations),\nand now it becomes a de-facto standard for managing Jenkins as code.\nThis year we also ran our very first CommunityBridge project devoted to JCasC Schema validation and developer tools.\n\nEvents and outreach programs.\nIn 2019 we participated in multiple conferences, including FOSDEM, DevOps World | Jenkins World, SCALE.\nMore than 40 Jenkins Area Meetups were organized across the world, and there were many other meetups devoted to Jenkins.\nWe also kept expanding our outreach programs.\nIn total we had 12 students who participated in Google Summer of Code, Outreachy and newly introduced Community Bridge.\nWe also had the biggest ever Hacktoberfest with 664 pull requests and 102 participants.\nThese outreach programs help us to deliver new features in Jenkins.\nFor example, this year we added Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab and a new Plugin Installation Manager Tool during GSoC,\nand Outreachy resulted in a new Audit Log Plugin.\n\nWhere did we get those stats?\nGitHub stats came from the CDF DevStats service.\nThese stats include all repositories in the jenkinsci organization and most popular repositories in jenkins-infra, Jenkins X and other organizations/repositories within the project are not included.\nOther stats came from project reports, component changelogs, Jenkins usage statistics service, plugin releases history.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nYear 2020 will be pretty busy for the Jenkins project.\nThere are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want the project to succeed.\nAs it was written Board elections blogpost,\nthere are many areas to consider: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.\nIn the coming months there will be a lot of discussions in mailing lists and special interest groups,\nand we invite all teams to work on their roadmaps and to communicate them in the community.\n\nNext month we will participate in FOSDEM, and there will be a Jenkins stand there.\nOn January 31st we will also host a traditional contributor summit in Brussels,\nwhere we will talk about next steps for the project, in terms of technical roadmaps and the project governance.\nIf you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join us at the summit!\nSee this thread for more information.\n\nWe also plan to continue all outreach programs.\nAt the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas ( announcement),\nand we will be also interested to consider non-coding projects as a part of other programs like CommunityBridge.\nWe also work on improving contribution guidelines for newcomers and expert contributors.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nAnd even more\n\nThis blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project.\nThe Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.\nThanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day.\nWe are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size.\nEverything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc.\nTHANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!\n\nSo, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.\nAnd stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!","title":"Happy New Year!

We are writing software faster than ever, but the demand for software seems to be going up even more, and I feel more and more businesses and executives are keenly aware that software and developers are king. At the ground level, every team I meet sees the software delivery automation to be a critical part of their \"software factory,\" and it’s important for them to create and manage them with unhinged flexibility and visibility.\n\nJenkins continues to play a major role in making this possible, after 14+ years since its birth, and if anything the pace of growth seems to be accelerating. In this dog year industry, that’s truly remarkable. Being a part of this achievement truly makes me proud.\n\nBuilding Jenkins, being a tool that everyone uses, comes with a great responsibility. So within the Jenkins community, we’ve been hard at work. In fact, 2018 has been the single most innovative year in the history of the whole project across the field, at multiple levels.\n\nAs we got bigger, we needed better ways to drive initiatives that cut across multiple people. This thinking led to JEPs and SIGs, and 2018 saw these formats getting great traction. After a year of operating them, I think we’ve learnt a lot, and I hope we will continue to improve them based on the learning.\n\nThese new formats gave rise to new collaborations. For example, Chinese Localization SIG resulted in our WeChat presence and localized website. Platform SIG was instrumental in Java 11 support.\n\nI’m also very happy to see new batch of leaders. In fear of missing out some people, I’m not going to list them individually, but we celebrated many of them as Jenkins Ambassadors this fall (and please nominate more for the next year!) Those people who lead key efforts are often people who are new to those roles.\n\nSome of the new leaders led other efforts that unlock new contributors. It’s about consciously thinking which segment of our potential contributors we aren’t tapping today and understanding why. Something any business does all the time. Ours resulted in Google Summer of Code and Outreachy participations.\n\nOur security process and the pace of fixes have gone up considerably this year again, reflecting our stepping up to the trust our users gave to us. For example, this year we rolled out a telemetry system that informs us to develop better fixes more quickly.\n\nNow, where these community improvements ultimately matter is what impact we are creating to software that you use. On that front, I think we did great in 2018, resulting in what I call\"5 super powers\" :\n\nJenkins X is probably the most visible innovation of this year, making it much easier to create modern cloud applications on Kubernetes. This also represents the significant expansion of the Jenkins community and its mission.\n\nJenkins Configuration as Code hit a major milestone \"1.0\" this year, and it’s continuing to gain more momentum and traction.\n\n\"Cloud Native Jenkins\" is the term I gave to a new effort that I’m calling to transform Jenkins into general purpose CI/CD engine that runs at scale on Kubernetes. There’s still much to be defined here, but you can already see some great things like Serverless Jenkins.\n\nEvergreen is another young and upcoming project that has ambitious thesis --- drastically simplifying the adoption and operation of Jenkins.\n\nPipeline effort formed a new SIG and I’m looking forward to the impact this will drive in 2019.\n\nThe not-so-secret sauce of the Jenkins community that threads together all these improvements from user visible changes to the community improvements is our ability to evolve. As I look forward to 2019, no doubt these things I mentioned will evolve, morph, merge, and split as we continue to learn and adopt.\n\nSo please, follow @jenkinsci and @jenkinsxio on Twitter to get updates on how we will evolve, and join our community to together build the software that rocks the world. How many open-source projects can say that?","title":"2018 in Review: A year of innovation","tags":["core","community","new-year-blogpost"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"kohsuke","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Kohsuke is the creator of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>","id":"kohsuke","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Kohsuke Kawaguchi","slug":"blog/author/kohsuke","twitter":"kohsukekawa"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2017-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":"983f4785-b11e-5d96-85e5-31c4a4070c62","slug":"/blog/2017/12/31/new-year/","strippedHtml":"Jenkins project congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!\nLet’s take a look at some changes this year.\n\nHighlights\n\nWe released major features like BlueOcean\nand Declarative Pipeline\n\nThese features offer a new user experience in Jenkins Web UI, powered by Jenkins Pipeline.\n\nIn Jenkins 2.54 we updated the Java minimal requirement to Java 8 ( announcement).\n\nPlugin CI has been moved to our Jenkins-on-Jenkins instance.\nAll plugins are being built by Jenkins Pipeline with a special pipeline library\n\nWe adopted the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal (JEP) process for major changes in Jenkins.\nThere are already JEPs under review:\n\nJEP-2: Criteria for selecting \"Suggested Plugins\"\n\nJEP-200: Switch Remoting/XStream blacklist to a whitelist\n\nJEP-201: Jenkins Configuration as Code\n\nSome stats\n\nIn 2017 we had 60 weekly and 13 LTS releases with 305 fixes/enhancements only in the core.\nNext week Jenkins is going to hit the 2.100 version, and the core changed greatly since the 2.0 release in April 2016.\nJenkins Security was one of the hottest areas this year, there were 7 security advisories for the core and 15 - for plugins.\nFor comparison, in 2016 there were only 6 security releases in total.\n\nThere were 2605 plugin releases, and 215 NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.\nIn particular Jenkins ecosystem has greatly expanded into the Cloud space\nby offering dozens of new plugins (e.g. for Azure and Kubernetes).\nWe also got many new plugins providing integrations with various Development and DevOps tools.\n\nOther subprojects and Jenkins components also got major updates.\nFor example,\nJenkins Remoting got 15 releases with stability improvements.\nStapler Framework also got 6 releases.\n\nKeep updating, Jenkins 2 is not only about Pipeline as Code!\n\nEvents\n\nThis year we got many new Jenkins Area Meetups.\nCurrently there are 77 meetups with more than 20,000 members in total ( full map).\nMore than 100 meetups have been organized around the globe.\n\nThere were also several Jenkins-focused conferences including the following ones:\n\nJenkins World in San-Francisco\n\nJenkins User Conferences in Israel and Shanghai\n\nDays Of Jenkins in Gothenburg and Oslo\n\nJenkins Community Day in Paris\n\nJenkins Days in Amsterdam\n\nCloudBees | Jenkins Automotive and Embedded Day in Stuttgart\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nNext year we will have traditional contributor meeting at FOSDEM\nand at Jenkins World 2018.\nIf you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join the contributor summits/hackathons.\nWe also want to participate in Google Summer of Code 2018,\nand currently we are looking for mentors.\n\nStay tuned, there is much more to come next year!","title":"Happy New Year!","tags":["community","new-year-blogpost"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"https://oleg-nenashev.github.io/","github":"oleg-nenashev","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins core maintainer and board member.\nOleg started using Hudson for Hardware/Embedded projects in 2008 and became an active Jenkins contributor in 2012.\nNowadays he leads several Jenkins <a href=\"/sigs\">SIGs</a>, outreach programs (<a href=\"/projects/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest\">Hacktoberfest</a>) and <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins meetups</a> in Switzerland and Russia.\nOleg works for <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/\">CloudBees</a> and focuses on key projects in the community.</p>\n</div>","id":"oleg_nenashev","irc":"oleg_nenashev","linkedin":"onenashev","name":"Oleg Nenashev","slug":"blog/author/oleg_nenashev","twitter":"oleg_nenashev"}]}},{"node":{"date":"2016-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":"3267c8fe-f10e-530a-9caa-bae9eeb34fb0","slug":"/blog/2016/12/31/what-a-year/","strippedHtml":"I do not think it is an exaggeration to say: 2016 was the best year yet for the\nJenkins project. Since the first commit in 2006, the project has reached a\nnumber of significant milestones in its ten years but we have never experienced\nthe breadth of major milestones in such a short amount of time. From\nJenkins 2\nand\nBlue Ocean\nto the\nGoogle Summer of Code\nand\nJenkins World,\n\nI wanted to take a moment and celebrate the myriad of accomplishments which\ncouldn’t have happened without the help from everybody who participates in the\nJenkins project. The 1,300+ contributors to the\njenkinsci GitHub organization,\nthe 4,000+ members of the\ndevelopers mailing list,\nthe 8,000+ members of the\nusers mailing list,\nand countless others who have reported issues, submitted pull requests, and\npresented at meetups and conferences.\n\nJenkins 2\n\nThrough the course of 2016, the Jenkins project published 16\nLTS releases\nand 54\nWeekly releases.\nOf those 70 releases, the most notable may have been the\nJenkins 2.0 release\nwhich was published in April.\n\nJenkins 2 made Pipeline as Code front-and-center in the user experience,\nintroduced a new \"Getting Started\" experience, and included a number of other\nsmall UI improvements, all while maintaining backwards compatibility with\nexisting Jenkins environments.\n\nSince April, we have released a number of LTS\nreleases using Jenkins 2 as a baseline, meaning the Jenkins project no longer\nmaintains any 1.x release lines.\n\nThe\nPipeline\nefforts have continuted to gain steam since April, covered on this blog with a\nnumber of\nposts tagged \"pipeline\". Closing out 2016 with the\nannouncement of the beta for\nDeclarative Pipeline syntax\nwhich is expected in early 2017.\n\nBlue Ocean\n\nHot on the heels of Jenkins 2 announcement\"Blue Ocean, a new user experience for Jenkins\",\nwas\nopen sourced in May.\nBlue Ocean is a new project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins.\nDesigned from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline and compatible with Freestyle\njobs. The goal for the project is to reduce clutter and increase clarity for\nevery member of a team using Jenkins.\n\nThe Blue Ocean beta can be installed from the Update Center and can be run in\nproduction Jenkins environments alongside the existing UI. It adds the new user experience under\n/blue in the environment but does not disturb the existing UI.\n\nBlue Ocean is expected to reach \"1.0\" in the first half of 2017.\n\nAzure\n\nAlso in May of 2016, the Jenkins project announced an exciting\nPartnership with Microsoft\nto run our project infrastructure on\nAzure. While the migration of Jenkins project\ninfrastructure into Azure is still on-going, there have been some notable\nmilestones reached already:\n\nEnd-to-end TLS encrypted delivery for Debian/openSUSE/Red Hat repositories which are\nconfigured to use https://pkg.jenkins.io by the end-user.\n\nMajor capacity improvements to\nci.jenkins.io\nproviding on-demand Ubuntu and Windows build/test infrastructure.\n\nA full continuous delivery Pipeline for all Azure-based infrastructure using\nTerraform from Jenkins.\n\nThe migration to Azure is expected to complete in 2017.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code\n\nFor the first time in the history of the project, Jenkins was accepted into\nGoogle Summer of Code\n2016. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual, international, program\nwhich encourages college-aged students to participate with open source projects\nduring the summer break between classes. Students accepted into the program\nreceive a stipend, paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or\nenhance the Jenkins project.\n\nIn exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteered as \"mentors\" for\nstudents to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed in\ncompleting their summer projects.\n\nA lot was learned during the summer which we look forward to applying to Google\nSummer of Code 2017\n\nJenkins World\n\nIn September, over one thousand people attended\nJenkins World,\nin Santa Clara, California.\n\nFollowing the event,\nLiam\nposted a series of blog posts which highlight some of the fantastic content\nshared by Jenkins users and contributors from around the world, such as:\n\nThe demos from the \"Experts\"\n\nSessions on Scaling Jenkins\n\nUsing Jenkins Pipeline\n\nThe Contributor Summit\n\nJenkins World was the first global event of its kind for Jenkins, it brought users\nand contributors together to exchange ideas on the current state of the\nproject, celebrate accomplishments of the past year, and look ahead at all the\nexiting enhancements coming down the pipe(line).\n\nIt was such a smashing success that\nJenkins World 2017\nis already scheduled for August 30-31st in San Francisco, California.\n\nJAM\n\nFinally, 2016 saw tremendous growth in the number of\nJenkins Area Meetups\n(JAMs) hosted around the world. JAMs are local meetups intended to bring\nJenkins users and contributors together for socializing and learning. JAMs are\norganized by local Jenkins community members who have a passion for sharing new\nJenkins concepts, patterns and tools.\n\nDriven by current Jenkins Events Officer,\nAlyssa Tong,\nand the dozens of passionate organizers, JAMs have become a great way to meet\nother Jenkins users near you.\n\nWhile we don’t yet have JAMs on each of the seven continents, you can always join the\nJenkins Online Meetup.\nThough we’re hoping more groups will be founded near you in 2017!\n\nI am personally grateful for the variety and volume of contributions made by\nthousands of people to the Jenkins project this year. I believe I can speak for\nproject founder,\nKohsuke Kawaguchi,\nin stating that the Jenkins community has grown beyond our anything we could\nhave imagined five years ago, let alone ten!\n\nThere are number of ways to\nparticipate\nin the Jenkins project, so if you didn’t have an opportunity to join in during\n2016, we hope to see you next year!","title":"Thank you for an amazing 2016","tags":["jam","jenkins2","pipeline","blueocean","azure","gsoc","new-year-blogpost"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":"http://unethicalblogger.com","github":"rtyler","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>R&#46; Tyler Croy has been part of the Jenkins project for the past seven years.\nWhile avoiding contributing any Java code, Tyler is involved in many of the\nother aspects of the project which keep it running, such as this website,\ninfrastructure, governance, etc.</p>\n</div>","id":"rtyler","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"R.
