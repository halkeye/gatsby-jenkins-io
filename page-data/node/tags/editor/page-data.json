We are happy to announce that you can try\nthe Pipeline Editor preview release today.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe Visual Pipeline Editor is the simplest way for anyone wanting to get started with\ncreating Pipelines in Jenkins. It’s also a great way for advanced Jenkins users\nto start adopting pipeline. It allows developers to break up their pipeline into different\n stages and parallelize tasks that can occur at the same time - graphically.\n The rest is up to you.\n\nA pipeline you create visually will produce a Declarative Pipeline Jenkinsfile for you and\n the Jenkinsfile is stored within a Git repository where it is versioned with your application code.\n\nIf you are not sure what a Jenkins Pipeline or a Jenkinsfile is, why not check out the new guided tour to learn more about it?\n\nWhat are we doing next?\n\nWe are working hard to provide feature parity between the Declarative Pipeline syntax and the visual editor. The next phase is to integrate the editor into Blue Ocean so that you don’t have to leave the UI and commit the Jenkinsfile to your repository to complete authoring your pipeline.\n\nIn Blue Ocean, you will be able to edit a Jenkinsfile\nfor a branch directly from within the user interface using the Visual Pipeline Editor. When you are done authoring your pipeline, the pipeline definition will be saved back to your repository as a Jenkinsfile. You can edit the Pipeline again using the Visual Editor or from your favorite text editor.\n\nWe are hoping to deliver this level of integration into Blue Ocean and the\nVisual Pipeline Editor over the next few months, so be sure to check regularly for updates in\nthe Jenkins plugin manager.\n\nGet the Preview\n\nThe Visual Pipeline Editor is available in preview today.\n\nTo try it out today:\n\nInstall the Blue Ocean beta and Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor from the Jenkins plugin manager\n\nClick on the Open Blue Ocean button and then the Pipeline Editor in the main navigation\n\nWe are looking forward to your feedback to help make the Visual Pipeline Editor\nthe easiest way to get started with Jenkins Pipeline. To report bugs or to\nrequest features please follow the instructions on the project page.\n\nAnd don’t forget to join us on our Gitter community chat\n- drop by and say hello!","title":"Say Hello to the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor","tags":["blueocean","editor","declarative","pipeline"],"authors":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"editor","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
