We’ve started documenting the capabilities that are available\ntoday and will continue as more become available.\n\nCredit: thanks to tracymiranda for the image\n\nUse version control for all artifacts\n\nThe Weaveworks folks coined the term GitOps which we love.  Any change to an environment, whether it be a new application,\nversion upgrade, resource limit change or simple application configuration should be raised as a Pull Request to Git, have\nchecks run against it like a form of CI for environments and approved by a team that has control over what goes into the\nrelated environment.  We can now enable governance and have full traceability for any change to an environment.\n\nRelated Accelerate capability:  Use version control for all production artifacts\n\nAutomate your deployment process\n\nEnvironments\n\nJenkins X will automatically create Git backed environments during installation and makes it easy to add new ones using\njx create environment.  Additionally when creating new applications via a quickstart ( jx create quickstart), Java based\nSpringBoot ( jx create spring) or importing existing applications ( jx import), Jenkins X will both automatically add\nCI / CD pipelines and setup the jobs, git repos and webhooks to enable an automated deployment process.\n\nOut of the box Jenkins X creates Staging and Production (this is customisable) permanent environments as well as temporary\nenvironments for preview applications from Pull Requests.\n\nPreviews Environments\n\nWe are trying to move as much testing, security, validation and experimentation for a change before it’s merged to master.\nWith the use of temporary dynamically created Preview Environments any pull request can have a preview version built and\ndeployed, including libraries that feed into a downstream deployable application.  This means we can code review, test,\ncollaborate better with all teams that are involved in agreeing that change can go live.\n\nUltimately Jenkins X wants to provide a way that developers, testers, designers and product managers can be as sure as they\ncan that when a change is merged to master it works as expected.  We want to be confident the proposed change does not\nnegatively affect any service or feature as well as deliver the value it is intended to.\n\nWhere Preview Environments get really interesting is when we are able to progress a PR through various stages of maturity and\nconfidence where we begin to direct a percentage of real production traffic like beta users to it.  We can then analyse the\nvalue of the proposed change and possible run multiple automated experiments over time using Hypothesis Driven Development.\nThis helps give us better understanding of how the change will perform when released to all users.\n\nRelated Accelerate capability: Foster and enable team experimentation\n\nUsing preview environments is a great way to introduce better test automation.  While Jenkins X enables this we don’t yet\nhave examples of automated tests being run against a preview environment.  A simple test would be to ensure the application\nstarts ok and Kubernetes liveness check pass for an amount of time. This relates to\n\nRelated Accelerate capability: Implement Test Automation\nRelated Accelerate capability: Automate your deployment process\n\nPermanent Environments\n\nIn software development we’re used to working with multiple environments in the lead up to a change being promoted to a live\nproduction environment.  Whilst this seems business as usual it can cause significant delays to other changes if for any\nreason that it is deemed not fit via some process that didn’t happen pre merge to master.  Subsequent commits then become\nblocked and can cause delay of urgent changes being promoted to production.\n\nAs above Jenkins X wants any changes and experiments to be validated before it is merged to master.  We would like changes in\na staging environment to be held there for a short amount of time before being promoted, ideally in an automated fashion.\n\nThe default Jenkins X pipelines provide deployment automation via environments.  These are customisable to suite your own\nCI / CD pipeline requirements.\n\nJenkins X recommends Staging should act as a near as possible reflection on production, ideally with real production data\nshadowed to it using a service mesh to understand the behaviour.  This also helps when developing changes in preview where we\ncan link to non production services in staging.\n\nRelated Accelerate capability: Automate your deployment process\n\nUse trunk-based development\n\nThe Accelerate book found that teams which use trunk based development with short lived branches performed better.  This has\nalways worked for the Jenkins X core team members so this was an easy capability for Jenkins X to implement when setting up\nGit repositories and CI/CD jobs.\n\nImplement Continuous Integration\n\nJenkins X sees CI as the effort of validating a proposed change via pull requests before it is merged to controller.  Jenkins X\nwill automatically configure source code repositories, Jenkins and Kubernetes to provide Continuous Integration of the box.\n\nImplement Continuous Delivery\n\nJenkins X sees CD as the effort of taking that change after it’s been merged to controller through to running in a live\nenvironment.  Jenkins X automates many parts in a release pipeline:\n\nJenkins X advocates the use of semantic versioning.  We use git tags to calculate the next release version which means we\ndon’t need to store the latest release version in the controller branch.  Where release systems do store the last or next version\nin Git repos it means CD becomes hard, as a commit in a release pipeline back to controller triggers a new release.  This results\nin a recursive release trigger.  Using a Git tag helps avoid this situation which Jenkins X completely automates.\n\nJenkins X will automatically create a released version on every merge to master which can then potentially progress\nthrough to production.\n\nUse loosely coupled architecture\n\nBy targeting Kubernetes users of Jenkins X can take advantage of many of the cloud features that help design and develop\nloosely coupled solutions.  Service discovery, fault tolerance, scalability, health checks, rolling upgrades, container\nscheduling and orchestration to name just a few examples of where Kubernetes helps.\n\nArchitect for empowered teams\n\nJenkins X aims to help polyglot application developers.  Right now Jenkins X has quickstarts and automated CI/CD setup with\nlanguage detection for Golang, Java, NodeJS, .Net, React, Angular, Rust, Swift and more to come.  What this also does is\nprovide a consistent Way of Working so developers can concentrate on developing.\n\nJenkins X also provides many addons, for example Grafana and Prometheus for automated metrics collection and visualisation.\nIn this example centralised metrics help understand how your applications behave when built and deployed on Kubernetes.\n\nDevPods are another feature which enables developers to edit source code in their\nlocal IDE, behind the scenes it is then synced to the cloud and rapidly built and redeployed.\n\nJenkins X believes providing developers automation that helps them experiment in the cloud, with different technologies and\nfeedback empowers them to make the best decisions - faster.\n\nFancy a closer look?\n\nMyself, James Strachan and\nRob Davies are going to be presenting and running workshops at\nDevOps World  | Jenkins World.  We’ll also be hanging out at the Jenkins X demo\narea so come and say hello and see what’s the latest cool and exiting things to come out of Jenkins X.  Use JWFOSS for 30%\ndiscount off registration\n\nWant to get involved?\n\nJenkins X is open source, the community mainly hangs out in the\nJenkins X Kubernetes slack channels and for tips on being more involved with Jenkins X\ntake a look at our contributing docs.  We’ve been helping lots of folks get into open source, learn\nnew technoligies and languages like golang.  Why not get involved?\n\nDemo\n\nIf you’ve not already seen it here’s a video showing a spring boot quickstart with automatic CI/CD pipelines and preview environments.","title":"Accelerate with Jenkins X","tags":["jenkinsx","developer","kubernetes"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"rawlingsj","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>James has a passion for continuous delivery and software automation in general.

There is a lot to Kubernetes but Jenkins X aims to provide a developer experience that doesn’t require you to understand it).\n\nWhy not use Jenkins X from code editing all the way to production,\nbefore you even commit the code or open a pull request?\nAll the tools are there, all the environments are there, ready to use (as they are used at CI time!).\n\nThis rounds out the picture: Jenkins X aims to deal with the whole lifecycle for you,\nfrom ideas/issues, change requests, testing, CI/CD, security and compliance verification,\nrollout and monitoring. So it totally makes sense to include the actual dev time tools.\n\nIf you have an existing project, you can create a DevPod by running (with the jx command):\n\njx create devpod\n\nThis will detect what type of project is (using build packs) and create a DevPod\nfor you with all the tools pre-installed and ready to go.\n\nObviously, at this point you want to be able to make changes to your app and try it out.\nEither run unit tests in the DevPod, or perhaps see some dev version of the app running in your browser (if it is a web app).\nWeb-based code editors have been a holy grail for some time, but never have quite taken off in the mainstream of developers (despite there being excellent ones out there, most developers prefer to develop on their desktop).\nIronically, the current crop of popular editors are based around\n“electron” which is actually a web technology stack,\nbut it runs locally (Visual Studio Code is my personal favourite at the moment),\nin fact Visual Studio Code has a Jenkins X extension (but you don’t have to use it):\n\nTo get your changes up to the Dev Pod, in a fresh shell run (and leave it running):\n\njx sync\n\nThis will watch for any changes locally (say you want to edit files locally on your desktop)\nand sync them to the Dev Pod.\n\nFinally, you can have the Dev Pod automatically deploy an “edit” version of the\napp on every single change you make in your editor:\n\njx create devpod --sync --reuse\n./watch.sh\n\nThe first command will create or reuse an existing Dev Pod and open a shell to it,\nthen the watch command will pick up any changes, and deploy them to your “edit” app.\nYou can keep this open in your browser, make a change, and just refresh it.\nYou don’t need to run any dev tools locally, or any manual commands in the Dev Pod to do this, it takes care of that.\n\nYou can have many DevPods running (jx get devpods), and you could stop them at the end of the day (jx delete devpod), start them at the beginning, if you like (or as I say: keep them running in the hours between coffee and beer). A pod uses resources on your cluster, and as the Jenkins X project fleshes out its support for dev tools (via things like VS Code extensions) you can expect even these few steps to be automated away in the near future, so many of the above instructions will not be needed!\n\nEnd-to-end experience\n\nSo bringing it all together, let me show a very wide (you may need to zoom out) screen shot of this workflow:\n\nFrom Left to Right :\n\nI have my editor (if you look closely, you can see the Jenkins X extension showing the state of apps,\npipelines and the environments it is deployed to).\n\nIn the middle I have jx sync running, pushing changes up to the cloud from the editor,\nand also the ‘watch’ script running in the DevPod. This means every change I make in my editor,\na temporary version of the app (and its dependencies are deployed).\n\nOn the right is my browser open to the “edit” version of the app.\nJenkins X automatically creates an “edit” environment for live changes,\nso if I make a change to my source on the left, the code is synced,\nbuild/tested and updated so I can see the change on the right\n(but I didn’t build anything locally, it all happens in the DevPod on Jenkins X).\n\nOn visual studio code: The Jenkins X extension for visual studio code can automate the creation of devpods and syncing for you. Expect richer support soon for this editor and others.\n\nExplaining things with pictures\n\nTo give a big picture of how this hangs together:\n\nIn my example, GitHub is still involved, but I don’t push any changes back to it until I am happy with the state of my “edit app” and changes.\nI run the editor on my local workstation and jx takes care of the rest.\nThis gives a tight feedback loop for changes. Of course, you can use any editor you like,\nand build and test changes locally (there is no requirement to use DevPods to make use of Jenkins X).\n\nJenkins X comes with some ready to go environments: development, staging and production (you can add more if you like).\nThese are implemented as Kubernetes namespaces to avoid the wrong app things talking to the wrong place.\nThe development environment is where the dev tools live: and this is also where the DevPods can live!\nThis makes sense as all the tools are available, and saves the hassle of you having slightly different\nversions of tools on your local workstation than what you are using in your pipeline.\n\nDevPods are an interesting idea, and at the very least a cool name!\nThere will be many more improvements/enhancements in this area, so keep an eye out for them.\nThey are a work in progress, so do check the documentation page for better ways to use them.\n\nSome more reading:\n\nDocs on DevPods on jenkins-x.io\n\nThe Visual Studio Code extension\nfor Jenkins X (what a different world: an open source editor by Microsoft!)\n\nJames Strachan’s great intro\nto Jenkins X talk at Devoxx-UK also   includes a DevPod demo","title":"Using Jenkins X DevPods for development","tags":["jenkinsx","developer"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":null},"blog":null,"github":"michaelneale","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Michael is a CD enthusiast with a interest in User Experience.\nHe is a co-founder of CloudBees and a long time OSS developer, and can often be found\nlurking around the jenkins-dev mailing list or #jenkins on irc (same nick as twitter name).\nBefore CloudBees he worked at Red Hat.</p>\n</div>","id":"michaelneale","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Michael Neale","slug":"blog/author/michaelneale","twitter":"michaelneale"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"jenkinsx","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
