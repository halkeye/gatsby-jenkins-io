Developers pushes forward with their projects and it is hard to maintain patterns to share code.\n\nI have, almost, solved code duplication with shared libraries but it does not allow me to setup a strict pattern that must be followed. Any developer can still decide to not invoke the features provided by the shared library.\n\nThere is also the security aspect of letting developers run any code from the Jenkinsfiles. Developers might, for example, print passwords gathered from credentials. Letting developers execute any code on the Jenkins nodes just does not seem right to me.\n\nA Branch Is Not A Feature\n\nIn Bitbucket there are projects and each project has a collection of git repositories. Something like this:\n\nPROJ_1\n\nREPO_1\n\nREPO_2\n\nPROJ_2\n\nREPO_3\n\nLets think about some features we want to provide for these repositories:\n\nPull request verification\n\nBuilding snapshot (or pre release if you will)\n\nBuilding releases\n\nIf the developers are use to the repositories being organized like this in Bitbucket, should we not organize them the same way in Jenkins? And if they browse Jenkins should they not find one job per feature, like pull-request, snapshot and release? Each job with parameters only relevant for that feature. I think so! Like this:\n\n/ - Jenkins root\n\n/PROJ_1 - A folder, lists git repositories\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1 - A folder, lists jobs relevant for that repo.\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1/release - A job, performs releases.\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1/snapshot - A job, performs snapshot releases.\n\n/PROJ_1/REPO_1/pull-request - A job, verifies pull requests.\n\n…​\n\nIn this example, both snapshot and release jobs might work with the same git branch. The difference is the feature they provide. Their parameters can be well documented as you don’t have to mix parameters relevant for releases and those relevant for snapshots. This cannot be done with Multibranch Pipeline Plugin where you specify parameters as properties per branch.\n\nDocumentation\n\nWebhooks are often well documented in the services providing them. See:\n\nBitbucket Cloud\n\nBitbucket Server\n\nGitHub\n\nGitLab\n\nGogs and Gitea\n\nAssembla\n\nJira\n\nIt bothered me that, even if I understood these webhooks, I was unable to use them. Because I needed to perform development in the plugin I was using in order to provide whatever value from the webhook to the build. That process could take months from PR to actual release. Such a simple thing should really not be an issue.\n\nThe Solution\n\nMy solution is pretty much back to basics : We have an automation server (Jenkins) and we want to trigger it on external webhooks. We want to gather information from that webhook and provide it to our build. In order to support it I have created the Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin.\n\nThe latest docs are available in the repo and I also have a fully working example with GitLab implemented using configuration-as-code. See the repository here.\n\nCode Duplication And Security\n\nI establish a convention that all developers must follow. Instead of letting the developers explicitly invoke the infrastructure from Jenkinsfiles. There are rules to follow, like:\n\nAll git repositories should be built from the root of the repo.\n\nIf it contains a gradlew\n\nBuild is done with./gradlew build\n\nRelease is done with./gradlew release\n\n…​ and so on\n\nIf it contains a package.json\n\nBuild is done with npm run build\n\nRelease is done with npm run release\n\n…​ and so on\n\nWith these rules, pipelines can be totally generic and no Jenkinsfiles are needed in the repositories. Some git repositories may, for some reason, need to disable test cases. That can be solved by allowing repositories to add a special file, perhaps jenkins-settings.json, let the infrastructure discover and act on its content.\n\nThis also helps the developers even when not doing CI. When they clone a new, to them unknown, repository they will know what commands can be issued and their semantics.\n\nA Branch Is Not A Feature\n\nI implement:\n\nJenkins job configurations - With Job DSL.\n\nJenkins build process - With Pipelines and Shared Library.\n\nBy integrating with the git service from Job DSL I can automatically find the git repositories. I create jobs dynamically organized in folders. Also invoking the git service to setup webhooks triggering those jobs. The jobs are ordinary pipelines, not multibranch, and they don’t use Jenkinsfile from Git but instead Jenksinfile configured in the job using Job DSL. So that all job configurations and pipelines are under version control. This is all happening here.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe plugin uses JSONPath, and also XPath, to extract values from JSON and provide them to the build. Letting the user pick whatever is needed from the webhook. It also has a regular expression filter to allow not triggering for some conditions.\n\nThe plugin is not very big, just being the glue between the webhook, JSONPath / XPath and regular expression. All these parts are very well documented already and I do my best supporting the plugin. That way this is a very well documented solution to use!","title":"Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin","tags":["webhooks","trigger","pipeline","security","scalability"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#98a8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/19e71/tomasbjerre.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/77b35/tomasbjerre.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/d4a57/tomasbjerre.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/19e71/tomasbjerre.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/68974/tomasbjerre.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/ef6ff/tomasbjerre.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/8257c/tomasbjerre.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/6766a/tomasbjerre.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/22bfc/tomasbjerre.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}},"publicURL":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b56c7aed67e544184e7807e4f2d189f6/tomasbjerre.jpg"},"blog":"https://bjurr.com/","github":"tomasbjerre","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Tomas Bjerre is an experienced fullstack software developer.
