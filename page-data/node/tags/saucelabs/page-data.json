The junit publisher will cover setting build status.\n                        sh \"./node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -e ${env.platformConfigs} --test ${env.sauceTestFilter} || true\" (1)\n}\n                }\n            }\n            post { /* ... unchanged ... */ }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n1\nThis double-quoted string causes Groovy to replace the variables with their\nliteral values before passing to sh.\nThis could also be written using singe-quotes:\nsh './node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -e $platformConfigs --test $sauceTestFilter || true'.\nWith a single quoted string, the string is passed as written to the shell,\nand then the shell does the variable substitution.\n\nMoving Complex Code to Shared Libraries\n\nNow that we have settings separated from the code, we can do some code clean up.\nUnlike the previous post, we don’t have any repeating code,\nbut we do have some distractions.\nThe nesting of sauce, sauceconnect, and sh nightwatch seems excessive,\nand that xUnit step is a bit ugly as well.\nLet’s move those into our shared library as custom steps with parameters.\nWe’ll change the Jenkinsfile in our main project,\nand add the custom steps to a branch named\nblog/declarative/sauce in our library repository.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\n@Library('bitwiseman-shared@blog/declarative/sauce') _\n\n/* ... unchanged ... */\n\nstage (\"Test\") {\n    steps {\n        sauceNightwatch saucelabsCredentialId,\n            platformConfigs,\n            sauceTestFilter\n    }\n    post {\n        always {\n            xUnitPublishResults 'reports/**',\n                /* failWhenSkippedExceeds */ 0,\n                /* failWhenFailedExceeds */ 10\n\n            saucePublisher()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvars/sauceNightwatch.groovy\n\ndef call(String sauceCredential, String platforms = null, String testFilter = null) {\n    platforms = platforms ? \"-e '\" + platforms + \"'\" : ''\n    testFilter = testFilter ? \"--test '\" + testFilter + \"'\" : ''\n\n    // Add sauce credentials\n    sauce(sauceCredential) {\n        // Start sauce connect\n        sauceconnect() {\n            // Run selenium tests using Nightwatch.js\n            // Ignore error codes. The junit publisher will cover setting build status.\n            sh \"./node_modules/.bin/nightwatch ${platforms} ${testFilter} || true\" (1)\n}\n    }\n}\n\n1\nIn this form, this could not be written using a literal single-quoted string.\nHere, platforms and testFilter are groovy variables, not environment variables.\n\nvars/xUnitPublishResults.groovy\n\ndef call(String pattern, Integer failWhenSkippedExceeds,\n        Integer failWhenFailedExceeds) {\n    step([$class: 'XUnitBuilder',\n        thresholds: [\n            [$class: 'SkippedThreshold', failureThreshold: failWhenSkippedExceeds.toString()],\n            // Allow for a significant number of failures\n            // Keeping this threshold so that overwhelming failures are guaranteed\n            //     to still fail the build\n            [$class: 'FailedThreshold', failureThreshold: failWhenFailedExceeds.toString()]],\n        tools: [[$class: 'JUnitType', pattern: pattern]]])\n}\n\nRunning Conditional Stages using when\n\nThis is a sample web testing project.\nWe probably wouldn’t deploy it like we would production code,\nbut we might still want to deploy somewhere,\nby publishing it to an artifact repository, for example.\nThis project is hosted on GitHub and uses feature branches and pull requests to make changes.\nI’d like to use the same Pipeline for feature branches, pull requests, and the master branch,\nbut I only want to deploy from master.\n\nIn Scripted, we’d wrap a stage in an if-then and check if the branch for\nthe current run is named \"master\".\nDeclarative doesn’t support that kind of general conditional behavior.\nInstead, it provides a\nwhen directive\nthat can be added to stage sections.\nThe when directive supports several types of conditions, including a branch condition,\nwhere the stage will run when the branch name matches the specified pattern.\nThat is exactly what we need here.\n\nJenkinsfile\n\nstages {\n    /* ... unchanged ... */\n    stage ('Deploy') {\n        when {\n            branch 'master'\n        }\n        steps {\n             echo 'Placeholder for deploy steps.'\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen we run our Pipeline with this new stage, we get the following outputs:\n\nLog output for 'feature/test' branch\n\n...\nFinished Sauce Labs test publisher\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // stage\n[Pipeline] stage\n[Pipeline] { (Deploy)\nStage 'Deploy' skipped due to when conditional\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // stage\n[Pipeline] }\n...\n\nLog output for 'master' branch\n\n...\nFinished Sauce Labs test publisher\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // stage\n[Pipeline] stage\n[Pipeline] { (Deploy)\n[Pipeline] echo\nPlaceholder for deploy steps.\n[Pipeline] }\n[Pipeline] // stage\n[Pipeline] }\n...\n\nConclusion\n\nI have to say, our latest Declarative Pipeline turned out extremely well.\nI think someone coming from Freestyle jobs, with little to no experience with Pipeline or Groovy,\nwould still be able to look at this Declarative Pipeline and make sense of what it is doing.\nWe’ve added new functionality to our Pipeline while making it easier to understand\nand maintain.\n\nI hope you’ve learned as much as I have during this blog series.\nI’m excited to see that even in the the short time since Declarative 1.0 was released,\nteams are already using it in make improvements similar to what those we’ve covered in this series.\nThanks for reading!\n\nLinks\n\nxUnit\n\nSauce OnDemand\n\nDeclarative Pipeline plugin\n\nDeclarative Pipeline Syntax Reference\n\nPipeline source for this post\n\nPipeline Shared

is a guest post by Liam Newman,\nTechnical Evangelist at CloudBees.\n\nTesting web applications across multiple browsers on different platforms can be challenging even for smaller applications.\nWith Jenkins and the\nSauce OnDemand Plugin,\nyou can wrangle that complexity by defining your Pipeline as Code.\n\nPipeline ♥ UI Testing, Too\n\nI recently started looking for a way to do browser UI testing for an open-source JavaScript project to which I contribute.\nThe project is targeted primarily at\nNode.js\nbut we’re committed to maintaining browser-client compatibility as well.\nThat means we should run tests on a matrix of browsers.\nSauce Labs\nhas an \"open-sauce\" program that provides free test instances to open-source projects.\nI decided to try using the\nSauce OnDemand Plugin\nand\nNightwatch.js\nto run Selenium tests on a sample project first, before trying a full-blown suite of tests.\n\nStarting from Framework\n\nI started off by following Sauce Labs' instructions on\n\" Setting up Sauce Labs with Jenkins\"\nas far as I could.\nI installed the\nJUnit and\nSauce OnDemand\nplugins, created an account with Sauce Labs, and\nadded my Sauce Labs credentials to Jenkins.\nFrom there I started to get a little lost.\nI’m new to Selenium and I had trouble understanding how to translate the instructions to my situation.\nI needed a working example that I could play with.\n\nHappily, there’s a whole range of sample projects in\n\" saucelabs-sample-test-frameworks\"\non GitHub, which show how to integrate Sauce Labs with various test frameworks, including Nightwatch.js.\nI forked the Nightwatch.js sample to\nbitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js\nand set to writing my Jenkinsfile.\nBetween the sample and the Sauce Labs instructions,\nI was able to write a pipeline that ran five tests on one browser via\nSauce Connect :\n\nnode {\n    stage \"Build\"\n    checkout scm\n\n    sh 'npm install' (1)\n\nstage \"Test\"\n    sauce('f0a6b8ad-ce30-4cba-bf9a-95afbc470a8a') { (2)\nsauceconnect(options: '', useGeneratedTunnelIdentifier: false, verboseLogging: false) { (3)\nsh './node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -e chrome --test tests/guineaPig.js || true' (4)\njunit 'reports/**' (5)\nstep([$class: 'SauceOnDemandTestPublisher']) (6)\n}\n    }\n}\n\n1\nInstall dependencies\n\n2\nUse my\npreviously added sauce credentials\n\n3\nStart up the\nSauce Connect\ntunnel to Sauce Labs\n\n4\nRun Nightwatch.js\n\n5\nUse JUnit to track results and show a trend graph\n\n6\nLink result details from Sauce Labs\n\nThis pipeline expects to be run from a Jenkinsfile in SCM.\nTo copy and paste it directly into a Jenkins Pipeline job, replace the checkout scm step with\ngit url:'https://github.com/bitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js', branch: 'sauce-pipeline'.\n\nI ran this job a few times to get the JUnit report to show a trend graph.\n\nThis sample app generates the SauceOnDemandSessionID for each test, enabling the Jenkins Sauce OnDemand Plugin’s result publisher to link results to details Sauce Labs captured during the run.\n\nAdding Platforms\n\nNext I wanted to add a few more platforms to my matrix.\nThis would require changing both the test framework configuration and the pipeline.\nI’d need to add new named combinations of platform, browser, and browser version (called \"environments\") to the Nightwatch.js configuration file,\nand modify the pipeline to run tests in those new environments.\n\nThis is a perfect example of the power of pipeline as code.\nIf I were working with a separately configured pipeline,\nI’d have to make the change to the test framework, then change the pipeline manually.\nWith my pipeline checked in as code,\nI could change both in one commit,\npreventing errors resulting from pipeline configurations going out of sync from the rest of the project.\n\nI added three new environments to nightwatch.json :\n\n\"test_settings\" : {\n  \"default\": { /*----8 <----*/ },\n  \"chrome\": { /*----8 <----*/ },\n\n  \"firefox\": {\n    \"desiredCapabilities\": {\n      \"platform\": \"linux\",\n      \"browserName\": \"firefox\",\n      \"version\": \"latest\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"ie\": {\n    \"desiredCapabilities\": {\n      \"platform\": \"Windows 10\",\n      \"browserName\": \"internet explorer\",\n      \"version\": \"latest\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"edge\": {\n    \"desiredCapabilities\": {\n      \"platform\": \"Windows 10\",\n      \"browserName\": \"MicrosoftEdge\",\n      \"version\": \"latest\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAnd I modified my Jenkinsfile to call them:\n\n//----8 (1)\n'chrome',\n        'firefox',\n        'ie',\n        'edge'\n    ].join(',')\n    // Run selenium tests using Nightwatch.js\n    sh \"./node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -e ${configs} --test tests/guineaPig.js\" (2)\n} //----8\n\n1\nUsing an array to improve readability and make it easy to add more platforms later.\n\n2\nChanged from single-quoted string to double-quoted to support variable substitution.\n\nTest frameworks have bugs too. Nightwatch.js (v0.9.8) generates incomplete JUnit files,\nreporting results without enough information in them to distinguish between platforms.\nI implemented a fix for it and\nsubmitted a PR to Nightwatch.js.\nThis blog shows output with that fix applied locally.\n\nAs expected, Jenkins picked up the new pipeline and ran Nightwatch.js on four platforms.\nSauce Labs of course recorded the results and correctly linked them into this build.\nNightwatch.js was already configured to use multiple worker threads to run tests against those platforms in parallel, and\nmy Sauce Labs account supported running them all at the same time,\nletting me cover four configurations in less that twice the time,\nand that added time was most due to individual new environments taking longer to complete.\nWhen I move to the actual project, this will let me run broad acceptance passes quickly.\n\nConclusion: To Awesome and Beyond\n\nConsidering the complexity of the system, I was impressed with how easy it was to integrate Jenkins with Sauce OnDemand to start testing on multiple browsers.\nThe plugin worked flawlessly with Jenkins Pipeline.\nI went ahead and ran some additional tests to show that failure reporting also behaved as expected.\n\n//----8 (1)\n//----8\n\n1\nRemoved --test filter to run all tests\n\nEpilogue: Pipeline vs. Freestyle\n\nJust for comparison here’s the final state of this job in Freestyle UI versus fully-commented pipeline code:\n\nThis includes the\nAnsiColor Plugin\nto support Nightwatch.js' default ANSI color output.\n\nFreestyle\n\nPipeline\n\nnode {\n    stage \"Build\"\n    checkout scm\n\n    // Install dependencies\n    sh 'npm install'\n\n    stage \"Test\"\n\n    // Add sauce credentials\n    sauce('f0a6b8ad-ce30-4cba-bf9a-95afbc470a8a') {\n        // Start sauce connect\n        sauceconnect(options: '', useGeneratedTunnelIdentifier: false, verboseLogging: false) {\n\n            // List of browser configs we'll be testing against.\n            def platform_configs = [\n                'chrome',\n                'firefox',\n                'ie',\n                'edge'\n            ].join(',')\n\n            // Nightwatch.js supports color ouput, so wrap this step for ansi color\n            wrap([$class: 'AnsiColorBuildWrapper', 'colorMapName': 'XTerm']) {\n\n                // Run selenium tests using Nightwatch.js\n                // Ignore error codes. The junit publisher will cover setting build status.\n                sh \"./node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -e ${platform_configs} || true\"\n            }\n\n            junit 'reports/**'\n\n            step([$class: 'SauceOnDemandTestPublisher'])\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis pipeline expects to be run from a Jenkinsfile in SCM.\nTo copy and paste it directly into a Jenkins Pipeline job, replace the checkout scm step with\ngit url:'https://github.com/bitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js', branch: 'sauce-pipeline'.\n\nNot only is the pipeline as code more compact,\nit also allows for comments to further clarify what is being done.\nAnd as I noted earlier,\nchanges to this pipeline code are committed the same as changes to the rest of the project,\nkeeping everything synchronized, reviewable, and testable at any commit.\nIn fact, you can view the full set of commits for this blog post in the\nblog/sauce-pipeline\nbranch of the\nbitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js\nrepository.\n\nLinks\n\nSauce OnDemand Plugin\n\nbitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js\n\nsaucelabs-sample-test-frameworks","title":"Browser-testing with Sauce OnDemand and Pipeline","tags":["tutorial","pipeline","plugins","saucelabs","selenium","nightwatch"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#382818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/77b35/lnewman.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/d4a57/lnewman.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/19e71/lnewman.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/68974/lnewman.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/ef6ff/lnewman.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/8257c/lnewman.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/6766a/lnewman.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/9717c5c33fe8f4903eec2f2b5a8d1532/22bfc/lnewman.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":128}}},"blog":null,"github":"bitwiseman","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Liam started his software career as a tester, which might explain why he&#8217;s such a fan of CI/CD and Pipeline as Code.\nHe has spent the majority of his software engineering career implementing Continuous Integration systems at companies big and small.\nHe is a Jenkins project contributor and an expert in Jenkins Pipeline, both Scripted and Declarative.\nLiam currently works as a Jenkins Evangelist at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees</a>.\nWhen not at work, he enjoys testing gravity by doing Aikido.</p>\n</div>","id":"lnewman","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Liam Newman","slug":"/blog/author/lnewman","twitter":"bitwiseman"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"saucelabs","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
