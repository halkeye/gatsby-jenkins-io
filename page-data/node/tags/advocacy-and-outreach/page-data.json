accessibility for Jenkins users,\nwork on new read-only interface for instances managed with configuration as code,\ncreate and update Jenkins themes,\nand many other topics.\nThis track is coordinated by the UX SIG.\n\nUser Documentation -\nImprove and create new user documentation, tutorials and solution pages.\nAlso, there is ongoing documentation migration from Wiki to jenkins.io and plugin repositories.\nThis track is coordinated by the Documentation SIG.\n\nSpread the word -\nWrite user stories for Jenkins Is The Way site and the Jenkins blog,\npost about your Jenkins user experience and new features,\nrecord overview and HOWTO videos, etc.\nThis track is coordinated by the Advocacy and Outreach SIG.\n\nWe are working on publishing project ideas and issues for the listed tracks.\nThe current list can be found on the UI / UX hackfest event page,\nthis list will be finalized by the beginning of the hackfest.\nYou are welcome to propose your own projects within the User Experience theme.\n\nDuring the event, we will organize online meetups and ad-hoc training sessions in different timezones.\nAll these sessions will be recorded and shared on our YouTube channel.\nThere are no mandatory sessions you must attend, you are welcome to join ones remotely or watch the recordings.\nAfter the event we will invite participants to demo their projects at online meetings or recorded sessions.\n\nRegistration\n\nThis event is over, thanks a lot to all contributors!\n\nP.S: Note that the registration form has a question top 3 things we could change in Jenkins

of the things we loved about going to developer conferences was meeting Jenkins users — newbies and old-timers alike — who are excited to talk about their projects and share tips on how to move forward using Jenkins.\nSince the coronavirus pandemic, we’re learning to rely more on new ways to gather, and it’s happening via Jenkins online meetups, GitHub collaborations, and Twitter threads, to name a few.\n\nIt’s a significant change.\nBut what hasn’t changed is the need to share stories about the things users have built, the solutions they’ve developed, and the excellent results they’re getting from some really innovative Jenkins implementations.\nThen we wondered, why isn’t anyone collecting these user stories and sharing them with the Jenkins community.\n\nIntroducing Jenkins is the Way\n\nSo we took the first step to record and archive all the great stuff everyone in our community is building with Jenkins.\nThis way, Jenkins users old and new can come to an archive and search for Jenkins solutions for inspiration.\nWe foresee a vast library of solutions from all around the world, solving a wide array of challenges in every industry imaginable.\nWe decided to call this archive \" Jenkins Is The Way\" and host it at https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io.\n\nTo aggregate all these stories, we built a simple online questionnaire so that Jenkins users can submit their own experience using this leading open source automation server.\nWith so many plugins to support building, deploying, and automating your projects, we expect to see a vast collection of stories.\n\nWe’ve already received a handful, including stories that illustrate how Jenkins Is The Way :\n\nto code your own release pipelines\n\nto cast magic of continuous delivery\n\nto understand and simplify your software lifecycle\n\nto accelerate automation in the cloud\n\nto facilitate day-to-day work\n\nAdd your story. Show your Jenkins pride. Get our T-shirt\n\nBe an inspiration to the Jenkins community by sharing your Jenkins story.\nJust go to this link and fill out the form.\nWe’ll ask you about your project’s goals, the technical challenges you overcame with Jenkins, and the solutions you created.\nIt should take no more than 20-30 minutes to complete.\n\nWe’ll clean it up for clarity and publish it on https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io.\n\nOnce it’s part of our archive, we’ll send you our new 2020 Jenkins Is the Way t-shirt.\n\nAnd since the more, the merrier, please share this blog post with peers and colleagues.\nWe want to hear everyone’s stories about the clever ways Jenkins is used to automate all that we need to do.\n\nThanks and Acknowledgement\n\nSpecial thanks to abConsulting for creating and managing the https://JenkinsIsTheWay.io site and for reviewing, editing, and publishing the submitted stories.\n\nThanks to the Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG for their reviews and feedback.\n\nThanks also to CloudBees for sponsoring the \" Jenkins is the Way\" program.","title":"Call for User Stories - Jenkins is the Way","tags":["announcement","outreach-programs","advocacy-and-outreach","jenkins-is-the-way"],"authors":[{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/8d248/alyssat.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/c004c/alyssat.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/a55dc/alyssat.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/9e67b/alyssat.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/22924/alyssat.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/89767/alyssat.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/40d97/alyssat.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/fee8c4b53c42d9c396735bc2b737ff84/5028e/alyssat.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":166}}},"blog":null,"github":"alyssat","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Member of the <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/\">Jenkins Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.\nAlyssa drives and manages Jenkins participation in community events and conferences like <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/\">FOSDEM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/\">SCaLE</a>, <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/\">cdCON</a>, and <a href=\"https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\">KubeCon</a>.\nShe is also responsible for Marketing &amp; Community Programs at <a href=\"https://cloudbees.com\">CloudBees, Inc.</a></p>\n</div>","id":"alyssat","irc":null,"linkedin":null,"name":"Alyssa Tong","slug":"/blog/author/alyssat","twitter":null},{"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#786888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b6d1673d3033c967ff61ee8d4c73aefc/60e20/markewaite.jpg","srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b6d1673d3033c967ff61ee8d4c73aefc/f4523/markewaite.jpg 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b6d1673d3033c967ff61ee8d4c73aefc/6859a/markewaite.jpg 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b6d1673d3033c967ff61ee8d4c73aefc/60e20/markewaite.jpg 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b6d1673d3033c967ff61ee8d4c73aefc/57001/markewaite.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b6d1673d3033c967ff61ee8d4c73aefc/1fd06/markewaite.webp 32w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b6d1673d3033c967ff61ee8d4c73aefc/a7803/markewaite.webp 64w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b6d1673d3033c967ff61ee8d4c73aefc/1a87d/markewaite.webp 128w,\n/gatsby-jenkins-io/static/b6d1673d3033c967ff61ee8d4c73aefc/27a57/markewaite.webp 256w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"}]},"width":128,"height":140}}},"blog":null,"github":"markewaite","html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Mark is the <a href=\"/project/team-leads/#documentation\">Jenkins Documentation Officer</a>, a long-time Jenkins user and contributor, and maintains the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/git\">git plugin</a> and the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client\">git client plugin</a>.\nHe is active in <a href=\"/sigs/\">Jenkins special interest groups</a> including the <a href=\"/sigs/docs/\">Docs SIG</a>, <a href=\"/sigs/platform\">Platform SIG</a>, and <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach\">Advocacy SIG</a>.</p>\n</div>","id":"markewaite","irc":"markewaite","linkedin":"markwaite","name":"Mark Waite","slug":"/blog/author/markewaite","twitter":"MarkEWaite"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"advocacy-and-outreach","limit":8,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
