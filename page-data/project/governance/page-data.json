We are a group of open-source developers and users who develop, use, promote Jenkins, software around Jenkins, and other related activities for our mutual benefit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The project is a part of the <a href=\"https://cd.foundation/\">Continuous Delivery Foundation</a> and\naffiliated with the <a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/\">Linux Foundation</a> legal entities which legally own the project assets and act as treasury.\nBefore 2021, these roles were held by\n<a href=\"https://www.spi-inc.org/\">Software in the Public Interest, Inc.</a> (SPI).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"our-philosophy\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#our-philosophy\"></a>Our Philosophy</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"lower-barrier-of-entry\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#lower-barrier-of-entry\"></a>Lower barrier of entry</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We strive for lower barrier of entry to the project. This is partly achieved by not requiring new contributors to “prove themselves” before they are admitted to the committership. Instead, we assume they are good until proven otherwise, and this principle applies to anybody without arbitrary discrimination. We recognize that every contribution is precious, and we recognize that every added process turn away some potential contributors.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The lower barrier of entry is partly achieved by structuring the project to core, plugins, modules, and other independent pieces, thereby reducing the need for collaboration and communication. We try to let everyone have their own turf where they can work efficiently without bogged down by discussions and compromises. We believe everyone has the right to express their idea in their own plugins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The lower barrier of entry is also partly achieved by recognizing that people move on. Lots of code in the project is maintained by people other than the original author. We encourage new contributors to take over existing projects that aren’t actively maintained. We believe that “old” contributors deserve respect from “new” contributors, but the inaction on the part of the original contributors shall not block new contributors from making changes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"meritocracy\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#meritocracy\"></a>Meritocracy</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Our striving to lower barrier of entry doesn’t mean everyone has the equal voice. We value those who contribute more to the project, namely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy\">Meritocracy</a>. Contribution shouldn’t be narrowly interpreted just to code changes, but rather it includes such activities as helping others in the community, doing PR, running infrastructure, and so on.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"transparency\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#transparency\"></a>Transparency</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We believe in running the project transparently. This includes everything from decision-making to defects in the code.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"compatibility-matters\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#compatibility-matters\"></a>Compatibility matters</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We recognize that users expect their existing data, accumulated under past versions (including Hudson up to 1.395) to continue working under future versions of Jenkins. This includes jobs configurations, build records, and plugin binaries that they are using. The Jenkins project places high value on maintaining this compatibility, and will be very careful in removing functionality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To enable the above goal, we also recognize that plugin developers expect APIs and other code that they depend on to remain available in future versions of Jenkins. This is not to say we don’t ever remove anything, but we do it very carefully.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Because one plugin can depend on another, we expect the same principle from plugins that many other plugins depend on.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"automation\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#automation\"></a>Automation</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>One of the goals of the Jenkins project is to enable more automation, and we apply the same principle in developing Jenkins. Accordingly, we develop and use a number of daemons, bots, and scripts to perform house-keeping activities and day-to-day operations, we use Jenkins ourselves to run many of those.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This not only frees our time to do more creative work, but it also helps reduce the barrier to entry by reducing the blockage of one developer by another. Plus it has the added benefit of eating our own dogfood.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"license\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#license\"></a>License</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins project uses the <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\">MIT License</a> as the primary license of choice, for the code that we develop. Unless otherwise stated, all the code is under the MIT license.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins\">core of Jenkins</a> is entirely under the MIT license, as is the majority of our <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra\">infrastructure code</a> (that runs the project itself), as well as many plugins. We encourage hosted plugins to use the same MIT license, to simplify the story for users, but plugins are free to choose their own licenses, so long as it’s an OSI-approved open-source license.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is not to be confused with proprietary plugins --- we recognize and encourage plugins that people write on their own for their internal use, without necessarily making the source code available. But no such plugins will be hosted by the Jenkins project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"cla\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#cla\"></a>Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To further clarify the intellectual property rights around the project, we require that core committers sign a contributor agreement. This CLA is the same as Apache&#8217;s CLA with \"Apache\" replaced by \"SPI\". This agreement explicitly assigns a set of rights to SPI, such as the effective joint copyright ownership, patent grant, as well as acknowledging that you have the necessary rights to contribute changes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The assignment of these rights to SPI helps Jenkins being neutral to any particular vendor, and it&#8217;ll also make legal departments happy especially in large organizations who want to use Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>CLAs come in two flavors. Every core contributor needs to sign an Individual CLA (ICLA), and in cases where you as an individual do not own the work you are contributing (such as when your company assigns you to work on Jenkins and therefore your company owns the hard work you produced), the corporation also needs to sign a Corporate CLA (CCLA). See <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas\">the discussion in Apache for more details</a>. The CLA forms can be obtained from the following URLs:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla/approved/icla.txt\">ICLA</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla/approved/ccla.txt\">CCLA</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To balance the additional overhead with the lower barrier to entry, this policy only applies to the core, although we welcome anyone who&#8217;s willing to submit a CLA for their work on plugins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Details to submit CLAs are documented in <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla/blob/master/README.md\">infra-cla README</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"3rd-party-library-licenses-in-the-core\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3rd-party-library-licenses-in-the-core\"></a>3rd party library licenses in the core</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins project depends heavily on 3rd party libraries. We believe it&#8217;s better to reuse what we can than to reinvent, so that our precious resources can be spent elsewhere.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins as a whole needs to be an open-source project, so we&#8217;ve been restricting ourselves to only use 3rd party libraries that are <a href=\"https://www.opensource.org/\">OSI-approved open-source licenses</a> (such as Apache Software License, BSD license, MIT license, Eclipse Public License, and Lesser GNU Public License.) In addition, to keep the core reusable for the widest possible use cases, we refuse so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft\">copyleft licenses</a> that restrict the overall license to a specific license (such as GNU Public License.) To that end, we designated the following licenses as approved licenses that we can depend on. Additional licenses are subject to the approval by the board:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/\">Apache Software License</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php\">BSD license</a>, <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\">MIT license</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/W3C.php\">W3C software license</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.php\">CDDL</a>, <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/cpl1.0.php\">CPL</a>, <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php\">EPL</a>, and <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/mozilla1.0.php\">MPL</a>, and <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php\">LGPL</a> (these licenses require that derivative works to be under the same license as the original license, so the source code needs to be separated into its own repository, but binaries can be used as dependencies to the core.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In core, the build process ensure that all the licenses of the dependency libraries are accounted for. In other words, we require that dependency POMs declare their own licenses in the Maven way, or use <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/licenseCompleter.groovy\">the license completion script</a> to supply one where the POM is missing that information. The completion script is also used in case the library is dual-licensed to pick a specific license. This is done so that the summary list of the 3rd party library licenses do not include copy-left licenses.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The result is packaged into the core and is visible from <a href=\"https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/about\">within the application itself</a>. It is also available in the XML format inside the war file.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"3rd-party-library-licenses-in-the-plugins\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3rd-party-library-licenses-in-the-plugins\"></a>3rd party library licenses in the plugins</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Plugins do not necessarily follow the same formality when it comes to the 3rd party license policy. They obviously need to honor the licenses of the libraries they use, but for example they need not run the same license completion scheme that the core uses.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We encourage plugins to follow the same 3rd party license policy as the core. You may vary from it at your own risk. For example, see <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#NFUseGPLPlugins\">FSF&#8217;s opinion about GPL plugins with a non-GPL core</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"trademark\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#trademark\"></a>Trademark</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>See the <a href=\"../trademark\">Trademark and Attribution</a> page for details.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"project-rolesstakeholders\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#project-rolesstakeholders\"></a>Project roles/stakeholders</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"governance-board\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#governance-board\"></a>Governance board</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The governance board consists of five people who act as public representatives of the project, when such representation is necessary, for example to interface external entities such as SPI or CDF.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The board also acts as the ultimate decision-making authority in case disputes cannot be resolved via the regular project community meeting. The decision-making ability of the board is more symbolic and honorific, and it “rules” like British queens rather than a dictatorship.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <a href=\"/project/board\">Governance Board</a> page provides further information, including a list of current board members, and how to contact the board.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The process by which the Governance Board is elected can be reviewed in the <a href=\"/project/board-election-process\">Board Election Process</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"infrastructure-admins\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#infrastructure-admins\"></a>Infrastructure admins</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Infrastructure administrators have root access to the various servers and build agents that run <code>jenkins-ci.org</code> and other sub-domains. They keep those servers up and running, installing new software, coordinating mirrors, handling keys and certificates, and making sure that we can keep churning out code.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Because of the sensitive nature of this work, infrastructure admins are by invitation only, and some of the activity happen behind closed doors. Infrastructure admins often appoint others to delegate some partial access to the system to complete some tasks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A list of admins of some of the public infrastructure components can be found here: <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Infrastructure+Admins\">Infrastructure Admins</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"core-committers\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#core-committers\"></a>Core committers</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Core committers are those who have push access to <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins\">the main Jenkins repository</a> that produces <code>jenkins.war</code>.

We do this so that people can feel ownership and attachment to their effort, and so that they won’t feel like they have to follow externally decided rules.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Since much of such local culture is implicit, it&#8217;s often difficult to tell from outside the operating culture of a given plugin. The safe rule of thumb is to contact existing developers upfront before doing any commit (but if there&#8217;s no timely response in a week so, you should feel free to commit.) Less actively maintained plugins tend not to have such local culture, so in those cases, if you feel lucky you can commit changes ahead and send a heads-up simultaneously, (and accept the possibility that the changes get reverted.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Maintainer information should be listed in the info box of the plugin&#8217;s wiki page.

It&#8217;s generally more practical and appreciated if you submit changes that don&#8217;t change the code format too much as it eases the coding review job. Try submitting formatting changes and functional changes in separate commits.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>With that said, we do not believe in rigorously enforcing coding convention, and we don’t want to turn down contributions because their code format doesn’t match what we use.

Copyleft licenses, even though they are open-sourced, cannot be copied, such as EPL and GPL.\nIn particular, this means we can copy Oracle Hudson&#8217;s source code under the MIT license, but not Eclipse Hudson&#8217;s source code under EPL.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The code to be copied must be clearly marked with the license it is under, and when copying, you need to maintain the copyright/license attribution in the header.

Where the library is significant to Jenkins and the impact is considerable to our users, we choose to maintain local patch sets to upstream libraries, just like Linux distributions maintain such patches for its packages.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We normally intend such local patches to be integrated into upstream, so we file tickets upstream and provide our diff. When this works, this allows us to go back to the pristine upstream release at some point in the future. Those patch sets are maintained in our git repositories as a parallel branch.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In some cases, the supposed \"temporary\" patch sets became more permanent for various reasons beyond our control, such as the ceased development in the upstream, but that&#8217;s only because that&#8217;s how it turned out, not because we intended it at the outset. With the distributed version control system, maintaining parallel patch release for Jenkins isn&#8217;t as hard as it used to be.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"how-to-join-the-project\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#how-to-join-the-project\"></a>How to join the project</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"bringing-in-new-pluginstoolslibraries\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#bringing-in-new-pluginstoolslibraries\"></a>Bringing in new plugins/tools/libraries</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you develop a plugin, we encourage you to co-host that with the Jenkins project so that other people in the community can participate.

This creates a permanent record on our system that allows future developers to understand how the code came into the current shape. This is not a requirement (especially for small changes), but we appreciate if you do that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refer to the ticket in your commit message by using the notation <code>[JENKINS-1234]</code> where <em>JENKINS-1234</em> is the ticket ID. This allows our scripts to understand the history and generate changelogs without human help. If you use the notation <code>[FIX JENKINS-1234]</code>, our bot will close the ticket automatically when the change is merged into the repository, and when the change is tested in our CI server. These notations create useful cross-references across systems, and are therefore highly recommended.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We encourage you to have a test case for the code you added to avoid future regressions. See <a href=\"/doc/developer/testing/\">Testing</a> for more details about how to write tests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Try to describe your changes so that other people understand what you did.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure you didn’t modify portions that aren’t related to your changes (most often caused by IDE auto-fixing import statements and other code formats.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We do try to be attentive to inbound pull requests, unfortunately we may fail to review some of them in a timely fashion.\nIf you notice that your pull requests aren’t getting attended to within a week or two, please drop us a note at the dev list or ping us in the GitHub pull request.\nSee <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pull+Request+to+Repositories\">Pull Request to Repositories</a> for more recommendations about pull request.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"this-document\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#this-document\"></a>This document</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This document is owned by the community and substantial changes are approved via the project meeting.\nSend your questions to the dev list, or add an item to the <a href=\"/project/governance-meeting/\">next governance meeting&#8217;s agenda</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"project/governance.adoc","title":"Project Governance Document"}},"pageContext":{"id":"project/governance.adoc"}},
