The attacker does not need a valid user account in order to exploit this vulnerability.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This affects all versions of Jenkins prior to 1.438 and 1.409.3, but only if you are running it on its stand-alone container. This “stand-alone container” setup includes those who have installed Jenkins via native packages, including Windows, Mac OS X, Debian, Redhat, and openSUSE.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"severity\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#severity\"></a>Severity</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We rate this vulnerability as <strong>high</strong>, as the attack is passive, even though it allows an attacker to impersonate the administrator.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"fix\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#fix\"></a>Fix</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This issue has been fixed in Jenkins 1.438. We recommend you update your Jenkins to this version or later.\nIf you don’t see the update in your update center, you can <a href=\"http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/1.438/jenkins.war\">download it manually</a> and replace your jenkins.war.\nLTS users should update to Jenkins <a href=\"http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war-stable/1.409.3/jenkins.war\">1.409.3</a>, which fixes this problem.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Running Jenkins on other servlet containers is another possible fix to the problem, such as jetty runner, which allows similar command-line execution.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"security/advisory/2011-11-08.adoc","title":"Jenkins Security Advisory 2011-11-08"}},"pageContext":{"id":"security/advisory/2011-11-08.adoc"}},
