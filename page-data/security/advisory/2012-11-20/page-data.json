This allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious HTMLs to pages served by Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to escalate his privileges by hijacking sessions of other users. To mount this attack, the attacker needs to know the exact URL of your Jenkins installation. This vulnerability affects those who run Jenkins on its built-in servlet container (this includes all the native packages.) (CVE-2012-6072)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The second vulnerability is so-called <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\">open redirect</a> vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to create an URL that looks as if it&#8217;s pointing to Jenkins, yet it actually lands on the site that the attacker controls. This can be therefore used as a basis for phishing. (CVE-2012-6073)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that allows an attacker with some degree of write access in Jenkins to embed malicious JavaScript into pages generated by Jenkins. (CVE-2012-6074)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>These vulnerabilities are discovered by <a href=\"https://soroush.secproject.com/\">Soroush Dalili</a>, and we&#8217;d like to thank him.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"severity\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#severity\"></a>Severity</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>These combined vulnerabilities are rated as <strong>high</strong>, as they allow malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the information and impersonate the administrator of the system. On the other hands, this attack can be only mounted passively, and the attacker needs to know the URL of your Jenkins installations.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"fix\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#fix\"></a>Fix</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.491</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.1</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"other-resources\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#other-resources\"></a>Other resources</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-advisory/jenkins-security-advisory-2012-11-20.cb\">Corresponding security advisory on CloudBees regarding DEV@cloud and Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"security/advisory/2012-11-20.adoc","title":"Jenkins Security Advisory 2012-11-20"}},"pageContext":{"id":"security/advisory/2012-11-20.adoc"}},
