These attacks allow an attacker without direct access to Jenkins to mount an attack.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the fourth vulnerability, a malicious user of Jenkins can trick Jenkins into building jobs that he does not have direct access to.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>And lastly, a vulnerability allows a malicious user of Jenkins to mount a denial of service attack by feeding a carefully crafted payload to Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"severity\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#severity\"></a>Severity</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The first three vulnerabilities (CSRF and XSS) are rated as <strong>high</strong>, as they allow malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the information and impersonate the administrator of the system. In addition, this allows Jenkins inside a firewall to be attacked from outside. On the other hands, this attack can be only mounted passively, and the attacker needs to know the URL of your Jenkins installations.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The build privilege escalation vulnerability is rated as <strong>medium</strong>, as it requires an attacker to be a valid user of Jenkins with a write access.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The last denial of service attack is rated <strong>low</strong>, as it also requires an attacker to be a valid user of Jenkins with a write access, and this does not result in any data loss nor privilege escalation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"fix\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#fix\"></a>Fix</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.502</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.3</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As a part of the fix, these versions contain the following incompatible changes. Administrators of Jenkins need to be aware of the following implications of the upgrade:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>JSONP support in <a href=\"/doc/book/using/remote-access-api/\">Remote access API</a> is removed. If you have other programs that depend on this behavior, you can set the <code>hudson.model.Api.INSECURE</code> system property to <code>true</code> to resurrect behaviour. However, this is highly discouraged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If your Jenkins does not have the security enabled, some of the <a href=\"/doc/book/using/remote-access-api/\">Remote access API</a> calls that previously didn&#8217;t  require <code>POST</code> now requires it. See the \"CSRF Protection\" section of the remote access API page for how to add necessary header.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"other-resources\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#other-resources\"></a>Other resources</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-advisory/jenkins-security-advisory-2013-02-16.cb\">Corresponding security advisory on CloudBees regarding DEV@cloud and Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"security/advisory/2013-02-16.adoc","title":"Jenkins Security Advisory 2013-02-16"}},"pageContext":{"id":"security/advisory/2013-02-16.adoc"}},
