This means an agent can ask a controller to do just about anything within the confinement of the operating system, such as accessing files on the Jenkins controller or trigger other jobs on Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This has increasingly become problematic, as larger enterprise deployments have developed more sophisticated trust separation model, where the administators of a controller might take agents owned by other teams. In such an environment, agents are less trusted than the Jenkins controller. Yet the \"single distributed process\" assumption was not communicated well to the users, resulting in vulnerabilities in some deployments.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>SECURITY-144 (CVE-2014-3665) introduces a new subsystem to address this problem. This feature is off by default for compatibility reasons. See <a href=\"/redirect/security-144/\">Wiki</a> for more details, who should turn this on, and implications.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"severity\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#severity\"></a>Severity</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>CVE-2014-3665 is rated <strong>high</strong>. It only affects installations that accept agents from less trusted computers, but this will allow an owner of of such an agent to mount a remote code execution attack on Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"affected-versions\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#affected-versions\"></a>Affected Versions</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The following versions are affected, but only if you connect agents that are managed by less trusted users.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>All the main line releases &lt; 1.587</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All the LTS releases &lt; 1.580.1</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"fix\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#fix\"></a>Fix</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Main line users should upgrade to 1.587</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LTS users should upgrade to 1.580.1</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"other-resources\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#other-resources\"></a>Other Resources</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-security-advisory-2014-10-30\">Corresponding security advisory on CloudBees regarding DEV@cloud, Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees, and Jenkins Operations Center by CloudBees</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"security/advisory/2014-10-30.adoc","title":"Jenkins Security Advisory 2014-10-30"}},"pageContext":{"id":"security/advisory/2014-10-30.adoc"}},
