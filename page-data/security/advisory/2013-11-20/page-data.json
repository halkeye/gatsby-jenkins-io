As a result people with local system access on the Jenkins controller can compromise passwords and SSH private key passphrases Jenkins uses to access Subversion repositories. Jenkins project would like to thank Lennart Starr for finding this issue.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"security-53-cve-2013-6373\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#security-53-cve-2013-6373\"></a>SECURITY-53 / CVE-2013-6373</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/Exclusion\">Exclusion-plugin</a> wasn&#8217;t protecting itself from unauthorized access to list and release resource locks that on-going builds have held.

Subversion itself does not store passwords securely anyway.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>SECURITY-53 is rated <strong>medium</strong>, as it allows anyone with access to Jenkins to mount an attack. However, the impact of the attack is limited, as it can only cause builds to fail and leads to no privilege escalation nor data loss.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>SECURITY-96 is rated <strong>low</strong>. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be granted access to a certain permission explicitly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"fix\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#fix\"></a>Fix</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Subversion plugin 1.54 contains the fix for SECURITY-58.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exclusion plugin 0.9 contains the fix for SECURITY-53.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build failure analyzer plugin 1.5.1 contains the fix for SECURITY-96.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Please update your plugins to receive fixes.
